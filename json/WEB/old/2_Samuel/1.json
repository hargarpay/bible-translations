They were stronger than lions.", "24": "You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you delicately in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.", "25": "How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle! Jonathan was slain on your high places.", "26": "I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.", "27": "How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished!\u201d"}

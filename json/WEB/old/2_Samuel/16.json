", "2": "The king said to Ziba, \u201cWhat do you mean by these?\u201d Ziba said, \u201cThe donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink.\u201d", "3": "The king said, \u201cWhere is your master's son?\u201d Ziba said to the king, \u201cBehold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.'\u201d", "4": "Then the king said to Ziba, \u201cBehold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.\u201d Ziba said, \u201cI bow down. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.\u201d", "5": "When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of Saul's house came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out and cursed as he came. ", "6": "He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. ", "7": "Shimei said when he cursed, \u201cBe gone, be gone, you man of blood, and wicked fellow! ", "8": "Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of Saul's house, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!\u201d", "9": "Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, \u201cWhy should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.\u201d ", "10": "The king said, \u201cWhat have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, 'Curse David;' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'\u201d", "11": "David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, \u201cBehold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.

Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.\u201d", "22": "So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. ", "23": "The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel both was like this with David and with Absalom."}

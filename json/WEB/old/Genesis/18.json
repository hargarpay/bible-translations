When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, ", "3": "and said, \u201cMy lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don't go away from your servant. ", "4": "Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. ", "5": "I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.\u201d They said, \u201cVery well, do as you have said.\u201d", "6": "Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, \u201cQuickly prepare three seahs[a] of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.\u201d ", "7": "Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant.

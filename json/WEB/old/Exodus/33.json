", "2": "I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

If I were to go up among you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'\u201d", "6": "The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.", "7": "Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it \u201cThe Tent of Meeting.\u201d Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.

", "10": "All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door. ", "11": "Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart from the Tent.", "12": "Moses said to Yahweh, \u201cBehold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people;' and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.' ", "13": "Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight; and consider that this nation is your people.\u201d", "14": "He said, \u201cMy presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.\u201d", "15": "Moses said to him, \u201cIf your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here.

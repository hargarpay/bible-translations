{"1": "Yahweh said to Samuel, \u201cHow long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.\u201d", "2": "Samuel said, \u201cHow can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.\u201d Yahweh said, \u201cTake a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. ", "3": "Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.\u201d", "4": "Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, \u201cDo you come peaceably?\u201d", "5": "He said, \u201cPeaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.\u201d He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. ", "6": "When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, \u201cSurely Yahweh's anointed is before him.\u201d", "7": "But Yahweh said to Samuel, \u201cDon't look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don't see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.\u201d", "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, \u201cYahweh has not chosen this one, either.\u201d ", "9": "Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, \u201cYahweh has not chosen this one, either.\u201d ", "10": "Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cYahweh has not chosen these.\u201d ", "11": "Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cAre all your children here?\u201d He said, \u201cThere remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.\u201d Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cSend and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.\u201d", "12": "He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, \u201cArise! Anoint him, for this is he.\u201d", "13": "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh's Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah. ", "14": "Now Yahweh's Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him. ", "15": "Saul's servants said to him, \u201cSee now, an evil spirit from God troubles you. ", "16": "Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.\u201d", "17": "Saul said to his servants, \u201cProvide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.\u201d", "18": "Then one of the young men answered and said, \u201cBehold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Yahweh is with him.\u201d", "19": "Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, \u201cSend me David your son, who is with the sheep.\u201d", "20": "Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul. ", "21": "David came to Saul and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer. ", "22": "Saul sent to Jesse, saying, \u201cPlease let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.\u201d ", "23": "When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."}

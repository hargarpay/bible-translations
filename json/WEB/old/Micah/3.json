Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, because they made their deeds evil.\u201d", "5": "Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, \u201cPeace!\u201d and whoever doesn't provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:", "6": "\u201cTherefore night is over you, with no vision, and it is dark to you, that you may not divine; and the sun will go down on the prophets, and the day will be black over them.", "7": "The seers shall be disappointed, and the diviners confounded. Yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer from God.\u201d[a]", "8": "But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh's Spirit, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his disobedience, and to Israel his sin.", "9": "Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice, and pervert all equity.", "10": "They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.", "11": "Her leaders judge for bribes, and her priests teach for a price, and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money: yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, \u201cIsn't Yahweh among us? No disaster will come on us.\u201d", "12": "Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest."}

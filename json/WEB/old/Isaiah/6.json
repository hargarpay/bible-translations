{"1": "In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. ", "2": "Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew. ", "3": "One called to another, and said, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies! The whole earth is full of his glory!\u201d", "4": "The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. ", "5": "Then I said, \u201cWoe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!\u201d", "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. ", "7": "He touched my mouth with it, and said, \u201cBehold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.\u201d", "8": "I heard the Lord's voice, saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?\u201d Then I said, \u201cHere I am. Send me!\u201d", "9": "He said, \u201cGo, and tell this people, 'You hear indeed, but don't understand. You see indeed, but don't perceive.'", "10": "Make the heart of this people fat. Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.\u201d", "11": "Then I said, \u201cLord, how long?\u201d He answered, \u201cUntil cities are waste without inhabitant, houses without man, the land becomes utterly waste,", "12": "and Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many within the land.", "13": "If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed, as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stump remains when they are cut down; so the holy seed is its stock.\u201d"}

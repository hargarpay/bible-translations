Boaz said to him, \u201cCome over here, friend, and sit down!\u201d He came over, and sat down. ", "2": "Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, \u201cSit down here,\u201d and they sat down. ", "3": "He said to the near kinsman, \u201cNaomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's. ", "4": "I thought I should tell you, saying, 'Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.\u201d He said, \u201cI will redeem it.\u201d", "5": "Then Boaz said, \u201cOn the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.\u201d", "6": "The near kinsman said, \u201cI can't redeem it for myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it.\u201d", "7": "Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel.

You are witnesses today.\u201d", "11": "All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, \u201cWe are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.

", "3": "The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, \u201cLord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.\u201d ", "4": "But when Jesus heard it, he said, \u201cThis sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it.\u201d ", "5": "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. ", "6": "When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. ", "7": "Then after this he said to the disciples, \u201cLet's go into Judea again.\u201d", "8": "The disciples asked him, \u201cRabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you. Are you going there again?\u201d", "9": "Jesus answered, \u201cAren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. ", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, \u201cLord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.\u201d", "40": "Jesus said to her, \u201cDidn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?\u201d", "41": "So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying.[c] Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, \u201cFather, I thank you that you listened to me. ", "42": "I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.\u201d ", "43": "When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, \u201cLazarus, come out!\u201d", "44": "He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, \u201cFree him, and let him go.\u201d", "45": "Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him. ", "46": "But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done. ", "47": "The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, \u201cWhat are we doing? For this man does many signs.

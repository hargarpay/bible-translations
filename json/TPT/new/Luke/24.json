Suddenly two men in dazzling white robes shining like lightning appeared above them.[b] ", "5": "Terrified, the women fell to the ground on their faces. The men in white said to them, \u201cWhy would you look for the living One[c] in a tomb? He is not here, for he has risen!

", "23": "They said they went to the tomb and found it empty. They claimed two angels appeared and told them that Jesus is now alive.

Each team was two disciples, seventy in all,[a] and he commissioned them to go ahead of him into every town he was about to visit.

As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to drive out[b] into his harvest fields many more workers. ", "3": "Now, off you go! I am sending you out even though you feel as vulnerable as lambs going into a pack of wolves. ", "4": "You won't need to take anything[c] with you\u2014trust in God alone.

How horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have humbled themselves and repented, and turned from their sins.

Do you really think you'll be highly exalted because of the great things I have done there? No! You'll be brought down to the depths of hell[i] because of your rejection of me!\u201d", "16": "Jesus concluded his instructions to the seventy with these words: \u201cRemember this: Whoever listens to your message is actually listening to me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me, and not only me but the one who sent me.\u201d", "17": "When the seventy missionaries returned to Jesus, they were ecstatic with joy, telling him, \u201cLord, even the demons obeyed us when we commanded them in your name!\u201d", "18": "Jesus replied, \u201cWhile you were ministering, I watched Satan topple until he fell suddenly from heaven like lightning to the ground.

Absolutely nothing will be able to harm you as you walk in this authority.

This is the true source of your authority.\u201d", "21": "Then Jesus, overflowing with the Holy Spirit's anointing of joy, exclaimed, \u201cFather, thank you, for you are Lord Supreme over heaven and earth! You have hidden the great revelation of this authority from those who are proud, those wise in their own eyes, and you have shared it with these who humbled themselves. Yes, Father. This is what pleases your heart and the very way you've chosen to extend your kingdom: to give to those who become like trusting children.", "22": "\u201cFather, you have entrusted me with all that you are and all that you have. No one fully knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully knows the Father except the Son.

Yet they didn't get to see as much as a glimpse or hear even a whisper.\u201d", "25": "Just then a religious scholar stood before Jesus in order to test his doctrines. He posed this question: \u201cTeacher, what requirement must I fulfill if I want to live forever in heaven?\u201d", "26": "Jesus replied, \u201cWhat does Moses teach us? What do you read in the Law?\u201d", "27": "The religious scholar answered, \u201cIt states, 'You must love the Lord God with all your heart, all your passion, all your energy, and your every thought.

There was once a Jewish[k] man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when bandits robbed him along the way. They beat him severely, stripped him naked, and left him half dead.", "31": "\u201cSoon, a Jewish priest walking down the same road came upon the wounded man.

Lifting him up, he placed him on his own donkey and brought him to an inn. Then he took him from his donkey and carried him to a room for the night.

If it costs more than this, I will repay you when I return.'[n] ", "36": "So, now, tell me, which one of the three men who saw the wounded man proved to be the true neighbor?\u201d", "37": "The religious scholar responded, \u201cThe one who demonstrated kindness and mercy.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cYou must go and do the same as he.\u201d", "38-39": "\u201339\u00a0As Jesus and the disciples continued on their journey, they came to a village where a woman welcomed Jesus into her home. Her name was Martha and she had a sister named Mary. Mary sat down attentively before the Master, absorbing every revelation he shared. ", "40": "But Martha became exasperated by finishing the numerous household chores in preparation for her guests, so she interrupted Jesus and said, \u201cLord, don't you think it's unfair that my sister left me to do all the work by myself? You should tell her to get up and help me.\u201d", "41": "The Lord answered her, \u201cMartha, my beloved Martha. Why are you upset and troubled, pulled away by all these many distractions? Are they really that important? ", "42": "Mary has discovered the one thing most important by choosing to sit at my feet. She is undistracted, and I won't take this privilege from her.\u201d"}

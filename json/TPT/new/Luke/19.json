As Jesus made his way through the city, Zacchaeus was eager to see Jesus. He kept trying to get a look at him, but the crowd around Jesus was massive. Zacchaeus was a very short man and couldn't see over the heads of the people. ", "4": "So he ran on ahead of everyone and climbed up a blossoming fig tree[b] so he could get a glimpse of Jesus as he passed by.", "5": "When Jesus got to that place, he looked up into the tree and said, \u201cZacchaeus, hurry on down, for I am appointed to stay[c] at your house today!\u201d", "6": "So he scurried down the tree and came face-to-face with Jesus.", "7": "As Jesus left to go with Zacchaeus, many in the crowd complained, \u201cLook at this! Of all the people to have dinner[d] with, he's going to eat in the house of a crook.\u201d", "8": "Zacchaeus joyously welcomed Jesus[e] and was amazed over his gracious visit to his home.

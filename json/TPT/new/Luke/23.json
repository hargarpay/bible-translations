{"1": "The entire council stood at once and took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. ", "2": "They accused him with false testimony before the governor, saying, \u201cThis man tells us we're not to pay our taxes to Caesar. And he proclaims himself to be Christ the King and Messiah. He's a deceiver of our nation.\u201d", "3": "Pilate asked Jesus, \u201cIs this true? Are you their king and Messiah?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIt is true.\u201d", "4": "Pilate turned to the high priests and to the gathered crowd and said, \u201cThis man has committed no crime. I find nothing wrong with him.\u201d", "5": "But they yelled and demanded that Pilate do something, saying, \u201cHe has stirred up our nation, misleading people from the moment he began teaching in Galilee until he has come here to Jerusalem!\u201d", "6-7": "\u20137\u00a0When Pilate heard the word Galilee, he asked if Jesus was a Galilean, as he knew that Antipas, son of Herod, was the ruler over Galilee. When they told him yes, Pilate saw a way out of his problem. Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at that time, so Pilate sent Jesus to Antipas.", "8": "When Antipas saw Jesus, he was elated, for he had heard a great deal about his ministry and wanted Jesus to perform a miracle in front of him. ", "9": "Antipas questioned him at length, but Jesus wouldn't even answer him.", "10-11": "\u201311\u00a0All the while the high priests and religious leaders stood by, hatefully accusing Jesus of wrongdoing, so that Antipas and his soldiers treated him with scorn and mocking. Antipas put an elegant purple robe on Jesus and sent him back to Pilate. ", "12": "That day, Antipas, son of Herod, and Pilate healed the rift between themselves due to old hostilities and they became good friends.", "13-14": "\u201314\u00a0Pilate gathered the people together with the high priests and all the religious leaders of the nation[a] and told them, \u201cYou have presented this man to me and charged him with stirring a rebellion among the people. But I say to you that I have examined him here in your presence and have put him on trial. My verdict is that none of the charges you have brought against him are true. I find no fault in him.[b] ", "15-16": "\u201316\u00a0And I sent him to Antipas, son of Herod, who also, after questioning him, has found him not guilty. Since he has done nothing deserving of death, I have decided to punish him with a severe flogging and release him.\u201d ", "17": "For it was Pilate's custom to honor the Jewish holiday by releasing a prisoner.[c]", "18": "When the crowd heard this, they went wild. Erupting with anger, they cried out, \u201cNo! Take this one away and release Barabbas!\u201d[d] ", "19": "For Barabbas had been thrown in prison for robbery[e] and murder.", "20": "Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, tried to convince them it was best to let Jesus go.

Crucify him!\u201d[f]", "22": "A third time, Pilate asked the crowd, \u201cWhat evil crime has this man committed that I should have him crucified? I haven't found one thing that warrants a death sentence! I will have him flogged severely and then release him.\u201d", "23": "But the people and the high priests, shouting like a mob, screamed out at the top of their lungs, \u201cNo! Crucify him! Crucify him!\u201d Finally their shouts and screams succeeded. ", "24": "Pilate caved in to the crowd and ordered that the will of the people be done.

The guards laid Jesus' cross on Simon's shoulders[h] and forced him to walk behind Jesus and carry his cross.", "27": "Massive crowds gathered to follow Jesus, including a number of women, who were wailing with sorrow over him. ", "28": "Jesus turned to them and said, \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me. You should be weeping for yourselves and your children. ", "29": "For the day is coming when it will not be the women with children who are blessed but the childless. Then you will say, 'The barren women are the most fortunate! Those who have never given birth and never nursed a child\u2014they are more fortunate than we are, for they will never see their children put to death!' ", "30": "And the people will cry out for the mountains and hills to fall on top of them to hide them from all that is to come.[i] ", "31": "For if this is what they do to the living Branch,[j] what will they do with the dead ones?\u201d", "32": "Two criminals were led away with Jesus, and all three were to be executed together.

The religious leaders sneered at Jesus and mocked him, saying, \u201cLook at this man! What kind of 'chosen Messiah' is this? He pretended to save others, but he can't even save himself!\u201d", "36": "The soldiers joined in the mockery by offering Jesus a drink of vinegar.[m]", "37-38": "\u201338\u00a0Over Jesus' head on the cross was written an inscription in Greek, Latin, and Aramaic:[n] \u201cThis man is the king of all the Jews.\u201d And all the soldiers laughed and scoffed at him, saying, \u201cHey! If you're the king of Jews, why don't you save yourself?\u201d", "39": "One of the criminals hanging on the cross next to Jesus kept ridiculing him, saying, \u201cWhat kind of Messiah are you? Save yourself and save us from this death!\u201d", "40": "The criminal hanging on the other cross rebuked the man, saying, \u201cDon't you fear God? You're about to die!

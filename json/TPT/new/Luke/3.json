Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea at that time. Antipas, son of Herod, was governor over Galilee, Herod's brother Philip was over the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was over Abilene.[b] This happened during the days of two high priests, Annas and Caiaphas.[c]", "3": "John went preaching and baptizing throughout the Jordan Valley.

Have you been warned to repent before the coming wrath of God? ", "8": "Then turn away from your sins, turn to God, and prove it by a changed life. Don't think for a moment that it's enough to simply be the favored descendants of Abraham. That's not enough to save you.[i] I'm telling you, God could make more sons of Abraham out of stones if he chose to!", "9": "\u201cEven now God's axe of judgment is poised to chop down your barren tree right down to its roots!

He is supreme.[m] In fact, I'm not worthy of even being his slave.[n] I can only baptize you in this river, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of holiness and into his raging fire.[o] ", "17": "He has in his hands a winnowing fork to clean up his threshing floor![p] He will separate the wheat from the chaff.

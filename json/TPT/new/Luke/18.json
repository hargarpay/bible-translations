{"1": "One day Jesus taught the apostles to keep praying and never stop or lose hope. He shared with them this illustration:", "2": "\u201cIn a certain town there was a civil judge, a thick-skinned and godless man who had no fear of others' opinions. ", "3": "And there was a poor widow in that town who kept pleading with the judge, 'Grant me justice and protect me against my oppressor!'", "4-5": "\u20135\u00a0\u201cHe ignored her pleas for quite some time, but she kept asking. Eventually he said to himself, 'This widow keeps annoying me, demanding her rights, and I'm tired of listening to her. Even though I'm not a religious man and don't care about the opinions of others, I'll just get her off my back by answering her claims for justice and I'll rule in her favor. Then she'll leave me alone.'\u201d", "6": "The Lord continued, \u201cDid you hear what the ungodly judge said\u2014that he would answer her persistent request?

He will pour out his Spirit upon them.[a] He will not delay to answer you and give you what you ask for. ", "8": "God will give swift justice to those who don't give up. So be ever praying, ever expecting, just like the widow was with the judge. Yet when the Son of Man comes back, will he find this kind of persistent faithfulness in his people?\u201d", "9": "Jesus taught this parable to those who were convinced they were morally upright and those who trusted in their own virtue yet looked down on others with disgust:", "10": "\u201cOnce there were two men who went into the temple to pray. One was a proud religious leader, the other a despised tax collector. ", "11-12": "\u201312\u00a0The religious leader stood apart from the others and prayed, 'How I thank you, O God, that I'm not wicked like everyone else. They're cheaters, swindlers, and crooks\u2014like that tax collector over there. God, you know that I never cheat or commit adultery; I fast from food twice a week and I give you a tenth of all I make.'", "13": "\u201cThe tax collector stood off alone in the corner, away from the Holy Place, and covered his face in his hands, feeling that he was unworthy to even look up to God. Beating his breast,[b] he sobbed with brokenness and tears saying, 'God, please, in your mercy and because of the blood sacrifice, forgive me,[c] for I am nothing but the most miserable of all sinners!'", "14": "\u201cWhich one of them left for home that day made right with God? It was the humble tax collector and not the religious leader! For everyone who praises himself will one day be humiliated before all, and everyone who humbles himself will one day be lifted up and honored before all.\u201d", "15": "The people brought their babies and small children[d] to Jesus so that he might lay his hands on them to bless them. When the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents and told them to stop troubling the Master. ", "16": "But Jesus called for the parents, the children, and his disciples to come and listen to him. Then he told them, \u201cNever hinder a child from coming to me. Let them all come, for God's kingdom realm belongs to them as much as it does to anyone else. They demonstrate to you what faith is all about.

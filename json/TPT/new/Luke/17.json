{"1": "One day Jesus taught his disciples this: \u201cBetrayals[a] are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of betraying others. ", "2": "It would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea than to face the punishment of betraying one of my dear ones! So be alert to your brother's condition, ", "3": "and if you see him going the wrong direction, cry out and correct him. If there is true repentance on his part, forgive him. ", "4": "No matter how many times in one day your brother sins against you[b] and says, 'I'm sorry; I am changing; forgive me,' you need to forgive him each and every time.\u201d", "5": "Upon hearing this, the apostles said to Jesus, \u201cLord, you must increase[c] our measure of faith!\u201d", "6": "Jesus responded, \u201cIf you have even the smallest measure of authentic faith, it would be powerful enough to say to this large[d] tree, 'My faith will pull you up by the roots and throw you into the sea,' and it will respond to your faith and obey you.\u201d[e]", "7-8": "\u20138\u00a0Jesus continued, \u201cAfter a servant has finished his work in the field or with the livestock, he doesn't immediately sit down to relax and eat. No, a true servant prepares the food for his master and makes sure his master is served his meal before he sits down to eat his own. ", "9": "Does the true servant expect to be thanked for doing what is required of him? ", "10": "So learn this lesson: After doing all that is commanded of you, simply say, 'We are mere servants, undeserving of special praise, for we are just doing what is expected of us and fulfilling our duties.'\u201d", "11": "Jesus traveled on toward Jerusalem and passed through the border region between Samaria and Galilee.

", "16": "When he found Jesus, he fell down at his feet and thanked him over and over, saying to him, \u201cYou are the Messiah.\u201d[i] This man was a Samaritan.", "17": "\u201cSo where are the other nine?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cWeren't there ten who were healed? ", "18": "They all refused to return to give thanks and give glory to God except you, a foreigner from Samaria?\u201d", "19": "Then Jesus said to the healed man lying at his feet, \u201cArise and go. It was your faith that brought you salvation and healing.\u201d", "20": "Jesus was once asked by the Jewish religious leaders, \u201cWhen will God's kingdom realm come?\u201d[j] Jesus responded, \u201cGod's kingdom realm does not come simply by obeying principles[k] or by waiting for signs. ", "21": "The kingdom is not discovered in one place or another, for God's kingdom realm is already expanding within some of you.\u201d[l]", "22": "Later, Jesus addressed this again with his apostles, saying, \u201cThe time is coming when a great passion will be awakened within you to see me again. Yes, you will long to see the beginning of the days of the Son of Man, but you won't be able to find me. ", "23": "You will hear reports from some who will say, 'Look, he has returned,' 'He's over here,' or, 'He's over there!' Don't believe it or run after them, for their claims will be false.

The sky opened up and rained fire and burning sulfur upon them, destroying everyone and everything they had built.

{"1": "Very early Sunday morning,[a] before sunrise, Mary Magdalene made her way to the tomb. And when she arrived she discovered that the stone that sealed the entrance to the tomb was moved away! ", "2": "So she went running as fast as she could to go tell Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved.[b] She told them, \u201cThey've taken the Lord's body from the tomb, and we don't know where he is!\u201d", "3": "Then Peter and the other disciple jumped up and ran to the tomb to go see for themselves. ", "4": "They started out together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.[c] ", "5": "He didn't enter the tomb, but peeked in, and saw only the linen cloths lying there. ", "6": "Then Peter came behind him and went right into the tomb. He too noticed the linen cloths lying there, ", "7": "but the burial cloth that had been on Jesus' head had been rolled up and placed separate from the other cloths.", "8": "Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went in, and after one look, he believed![d] ", "9": "For until then they hadn't understood the Scriptures that prophesied[e] that he was destined to rise from the dead.[f] ", "10": "Puzzled, Peter and the other disciple then left and went back to their homes.", "11": "Mary arrived back at the tomb, broken and sobbing. She stooped to peer inside, and through her tears ", "12": "she saw two angels in dazzling white robes, sitting where Jesus' body had been laid\u2014one at the head and one at the feet![g]", "13": "\u201cDear woman, why are you crying?\u201d they asked. Mary answered, \u201cThey have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they've laid him.\u201d", "14": "Then she turned around to leave, and there was Jesus standing in front of her, but she didn't realize that it was him!", "15": "He said to her, \u201cDear woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?\u201d Mary answered, thinking he was only the gardener, \u201cSir, if you have taken his body somewhere else, tell me, and I will go and . . .\u201d", "16": "\u201cMary,\u201d Jesus interrupted her. Turning to face him, she said, \u201cRabboni!\u201d (Aramaic for \u201cmy teacher\u201d)", "17": "Jesus cautioned her, \u201cMary, don't hold on to me now, for I haven't yet ascended to God, my Father. And he's not only my Father and God, but now he's your Father and your God! Now go to my brothers[h] and tell them what I've told you, that I am ascending to my Father\u2014and your Father, to my God\u2014and your God!\u201d", "18": "Then Mary Magdalene left to inform the disciples of her encounter with Jesus. \u201cI have seen the Lord!\u201d she told them. And she gave them his message.", "19": "That evening,[i] the disciples gathered together. And because they were afraid of reprisals from the Jewish leaders, they had locked the doors to the place where they met. But suddenly Jesus appeared among them and said,[j] \u201cPeace to you!\u201d[k] ", "20": "Then he showed them the wounds of his hands and his side\u2014they were overjoyed to see the Lord with their own eyes!", "21": "Jesus repeated his greeting, \u201cPeace to you!\u201d And he told them, \u201cJust as the Father has sent me, I'm now sending you.\u201d ", "22": "Then, taking a deep breath, he blew[l] on them and said, \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit.[m] ", "23": "I send you to preach the forgiveness[n] of sins\u2014and people's sins will be forgiven. But if you don't proclaim the forgiveness of their sins, they will remain guilty.\u201d[o]", "24": "One of the twelve wasn't present when Jesus appeared to them\u2014it was Thomas, whose nickname was \u201cthe Twin.\u201d ", "25": "So the disciples informed him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord with our own eyes!\u201d Still unconvinced, Thomas replied, \u201cThere's no way I'm going to believe this unless I personally see the wounds of the nails[p] in his hands, touch them with my finger, and put my hand into the wound of his side where he was pierced!\u201d", "26": "Then eight days later, Thomas and all the others were in the house together. And even though all the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly stood before them! \u201cPeace to you,\u201d he said.", "27": "Then, looking into Thomas' eyes, he said, \u201cPut your finger here in the wounds of my hands. Here\u2014put your hand into my wounded side and see for yourself. Thomas, don't give in to your doubts any longer, just believe!\u201d", "28": "Then the words spilled out of his heart\u2014\u201cYou are my Lord, and you are my God!\u201d", "29": "Jesus responded, \u201cThomas, now that you've seen me, you believe. But there are those who have never seen me with their eyes but have believed in me with their hearts, and they will be blessed even more!\u201d", "30": "Jesus went on to do many more miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not even included in this book. ", "31": "But all that is recorded here is so that you will fully believe[q] that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God, and that through your faith in him you will experience eternal life[r] by the power of his name!"}

Here is your man!\u201d[d]", "6": "No sooner did the high priests and the temple guards see Jesus that they all shouted in a frenzy, \u201cCrucify him! Crucify him!\u201d Pilate replied, \u201cYou take him then and nail him to a cross yourselves! I told you\u2014he's not guilty! I find no reason to condemn him.\u201d", "7": "The Jewish leaders shouted back, \u201cBut we have the Law!

Don't you know that I have the power to grant you your freedom or nail you to a tree?\u201d", "11": "Jesus answered, \u201cYou would have no power over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. This is why the one who betrayed[g] me is guilty of an even greater sin.\u201d", "12": "From then on Pilate tried to find a way out of the situation and to set him free, but the Jewish authorities shouted him down: \u201cIf you let this man go, you're no friend of Caesar! Anyone who declares himself a king is an enemy of the emperor!\u201d[h]", "13": "So when Pilate heard this threat, he relented and had Jesus, who was torn and bleeding, brought outside. Then he went up the elevated stone platform and took his seat on the judgment bench\u2014which in Aramaic is called Gabbatha,[i] or \u201cThe Bench.\u201d ", "14": "And it was now almost noon.

Take him away and crucify him!\u201d Pilate replied, \u201cShall I nail your king to a cross?\u201d The high priests answered, \u201cWe have no other king but Caesar!\u201d", "16": "Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them.

Many of the people of Jerusalem read the sign, for he was crucified near the city. The sign stated: \u201cJesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\u201d[k]", "21": "But the chief priests of the Jews[l] said to Pilate, \u201cYou must change the sign!

But his tunic was seamless, woven from the top to the bottom[m] as a single garment.

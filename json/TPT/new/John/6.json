Here's a young person[c] with five barley loaves and two small fish . . . but how far would that go with this huge crowd?\u201d", "10": "\u201cHave everyone sit down,\u201d Jesus said to his disciples. So on the vast grassy slope, more than five thousand hungry people sat down.[d] ", "11": "Jesus then took the barley loaves[e] and the fish and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to the disciples to distribute to the people. Miraculously, the food multiplied, with everyone eating as much as they wanted![f]", "12": "When everyone was satisfied, Jesus told his disciples, \u201cNow go back and gather up the pieces left over so that nothing will be wasted.\u201d ", "13": "The disciples filled up twelve baskets of fragments, a basket of leftovers for each disciple.", "14": "All the people were astounded as they saw with their own eyes the incredible miracle Jesus had performed!

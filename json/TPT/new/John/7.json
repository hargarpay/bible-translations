", "4": "No one can see what you're doing here in the backwoods of Galilee. How do you expect to be successful and famous if you do all these things in secret? Now is your time\u2014go to Jerusalem, come out of hiding, and show the world who you are!\u201d ", "5": "His brothers were pushing him, even though they didn't yet believe in him as the Savior.[d]", "6": "Jesus responded, \u201cMy time of being unveiled hasn't yet come, but any time is a suitable opportunity for you to gain man's approval.

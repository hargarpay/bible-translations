{"1": "Afterward, as Jesus walked down the street, he noticed a man blind from birth. ", "2": "His disciples asked him, \u201cTeacher, whose sin caused this guy's blindness, his own, or the sin of his parents?\u201d", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cNeither. It happened to him so that you could watch him experience God's miracle. ", "4": "While I am with you, it is daytime and we must do the works of God who sent me while the light shines. For there is coming a dark night when no one will be able to work.[a] ", "5": "As long as I am with you my life is the light that pierces the world's darkness.\u201d", "6": "Then Jesus spat on the ground and made some clay with his saliva.[b] Then he anointed the blind man's eyes with the clay. ", "7": "And he said to the blind man, \u201cNow go and wash the clay from your eyes in the ritual pool of Siloam.\u201d[c] So he went and washed his face and as he came back, he could see for the first time in his life![d]", "8": "This caused quite a stir among the people of the neighborhood, for they noticed the blind beggar was now seeing! They began to say to one another, \u201cIsn't this the blind man who once sat and begged?\u201d ", "9": "Some said, \u201cNo, it can't be him!\u201d Others said, \u201cBut it looks just like him\u2014it has to be him!\u201d All the while the man kept insisting, \u201cI'm the man who was blind!\u201d", "10": "Finally, they asked him, \u201cWhat has happened to you?\u201d", "11": "He replied, \u201cI met the man named Jesus! He rubbed clay on my eyes and said, 'Go to the pool named Siloam and wash.' So I went and while I was washing the clay from my eyes I began to see for the very first time ever!\u201d[e]", "12": "So the people of the neighborhood inquired, \u201cWhere is this man?\u201d \u201cI have no idea.\u201d the man replied.", "13": "So the people marched him over to the Pharisees to speak with them. ", "14": "They were concerned because the miracle Jesus performed by making clay with his saliva and anointing the man's eyes happened on a Sabbath day, a day that no one was allowed to \u201cwork.\u201d", "15": "Then the Pharisees asked the man, \u201cHow did you have your sight restored?\u201d He replied, \u201cA man anointed my eyes with clay, then I washed, and now I can see for the first time in my life!\u201d", "16": "Then an argument broke out among the Pharisees over the healing of the blind man on the Sabbath. Some said, \u201cThis man who performed this healing is clearly not from God! He doesn't even observe the Sabbath!\u201d Others said, \u201cIf Jesus is just an ordinary sinner,[f] how could he perform a miracle like that?\u201d", "17": "This prompted them to turn on the man healed of blindness, putting him on the spot in front of them all, demanding an answer. They asked, \u201cWho do you say he is\u2014this man who opened your blind eyes?\u201d \u201cHe's a prophet of God!\u201d the man replied.", "18": "Still refusing to believe that the man had been healed and was truly blind from birth, the Jewish leaders called for the man's parents to be brought to them.", "19-20": "\u201320\u00a0So they asked his parents, \u201cIs this your son?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d they answered. \u201cWas he really born blind?\u201d \u201cYes, he was,\u201d they replied. So they pressed his parents to answer, \u201cThen how is it that he's now seeing?\u201d", "21": "\u201cWe have no idea,\u201d they answered. \u201cWe don't know what happened to our son. Ask him, he's a mature adult. He can speak for himself.\u201d ", "22": "(Now the parents were obviously intimidated by the Jewish religious leaders, for they had already announced to the people that if anyone publicly confessed Jesus as the Messiah, they would be excommunicated. ", "23": "That's why they told them, \u201cAsk him, he's a mature adult. He can speak for himself.\u201d)", "24": "So once again they summoned the man who was healed of blindness and said to him, \u201cSwear to God to tell us the truth![g] We know the man who healed you is a sinful man! Do you agree?\u201d", "25": "The healed man replied, \u201cI have no idea what kind of man he is. All I know is that I was blind and now I can see for the first time in my life!\u201d", "26": "\u201cBut what did he do to you?\u201d they asked. \u201cHow did he heal you?\u201d", "27": "The man responded, \u201cI told you once and you didn't listen to me. Why do you make me repeat it? Are you wanting to be his followers too?\u201d", "28": "This angered the Jewish leaders. They heaped insults on him, \u201cWe can tell you are one of his followers\u2014now we know it! We are true followers of Moses, ", "29": "for we know that God spoke to Moses directly. But as for this one, we don't know where he's coming from!\u201d", "30": "\u201cWell, what a surprise this is!\u201d the man said. \u201cYou don't even know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes and now I can see! ", "31": "We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but only to godly people who do his will. ", "32": "Yet who has ever heard of a man born blind that was healed and given back his eyesight? ", "33": "I tell you, if this man isn't from God, he wouldn't be able to heal me like he has!\u201d", "34": "Some of the Jewish leaders were enraged and said, \u201cJust who do you think you are to lecture us! You were born a blind, filthy sinner!\u201d So they threw the man out in the street.", "35": "When Jesus learned they had thrown him out, he went to find him and said to him, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of God?\u201d[h]", "36": "The man whose blind eyes were healed answered, \u201cWho is he, Master? Tell me so that I can place all my faith in him.\u201d", "37": "Jesus replied, \u201cYou're looking right at him. He's speaking with you. It's me, the one in front of you now.\u201d", "38": "Then the man threw himself at his feet and worshiped Jesus and said, \u201cLord, I believe in you!\u201d[i]", "39": "And Jesus said, \u201cI have come to judge those who think they see and make them blind. And for those who are blind, I have come to make them see.\u201d", "40": "Some of the Pharisees were standing nearby and overheard these words. They interrupted Jesus and said, \u201cYou mean to tell us that we are blind?\u201d", "41": "Jesus told them, \u201cIf you would acknowledge your blindness, then your sin would be removed. But now that you claim to see, your sin remains with you!\u201d[j]"}

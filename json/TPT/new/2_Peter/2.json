", "2": "Many will follow immoral lifestyles.[c] Because of these corrupt false teachers, the way of truth[d] will be slandered. ", "3": "They are only out for themselves,[e] ready to exploit you for their own gain through their cunning arguments. Their condemnation has been a long time coming. But their destruction does not slumber[f] or sit idly by, for it is sure to come.", "4": "Now, don't forget, God had no pity for the angels when they sinned[g] but threw them into the lowest, darkest dungeon of gloom[h] and locked them in chains, where they are firmly held until the judgment of torment.[i]", "5": "And he did not spare the former world[j] in the days of Noah when he sent a flood to destroy a depraved world[k] (although he protected Noah, the preacher of righteousness, along with seven members of his family).[l]", "6": "And don't forget that he reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemning them to ruin and destruction.[m] God appointed them to be examples as to what is coming to the ungodly.[n] ", "7": "Yet he rescued a righteous man, Lot, suffering the indignity of the unbridled lusts of the lawless.[o] ", "8": "For righteous Lot lived among them day after day, distressed in his righteous soul by the rebellious deeds he saw and heard.", "9": "If the Lord Yahweh rescued Lot, he knows how to continually rescue the godly from their trials and to reserve the ungodly for punishment on the day of judgment.[p] ", "10": "And this especially applies to those who live their lives despising authorities[q] and who abandon themselves to chasing the depraved lusts of their flesh.

So Jesus called his disciples to come near him and said to them, ", "2": "\u201cMy heart goes out to this crowd, for they've already been here with me for three days with nothing to eat. ", "3": "I'm concerned that if I send them home hungry, they'll be exhausted along the way, for some of them have come a long, long way just to be with me.\u201d", "4": "His disciples replied, \u201cBut could anyone possibly get enough food to satisfy a crowd this size out here in this isolated place?\u201d", "5": "He asked them, \u201cHow many loaves of flatbread have you got?\u201d \u201cSeven,\u201d they replied.", "6": "Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the grass. After he took the seven loaves, he gave thanks to God, broke them, and started handing them to his disciples. They kept distributing the bread until they had served the entire crowd.", "7": "They also had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for these, Jesus had his disciples serve them to the crowd.

Then he dismissed the crowd.[c]", "10": "Afterward, Jesus got into a boat and sailed to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.[d]", "11": "As soon as Jesus landed,[e] he was confronted by the Pharisees,[f] who argued with Jesus and tested him. They demanded that he give them a miraculous sign from heaven.", "12": "And with a deep sigh from his spirit, he said, \u201cWhat drives this generation to clamor for a sign? Listen to the truth: there will absolutely be no sign given to this generation!\u201d[g] ", "13": "Then he turned and left them, got back into the boat, and crossed over to the opposite shore.", "14": "Now, the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them, except for one loaf of flatbread.

And he said to them: \u201cIf you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own, as you continually surrender to my ways.[x] ", "35": "For if you let your life go for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, you will continually experience true life.[y] But if you choose to keep your life for yourself, you will forfeit what you try to keep.

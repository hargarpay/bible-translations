{"1": "Once again Jesus went to teach the people on the shore of Lake Galilee[a] and a massive crowd surrounded him.

", "6": "But when the days grew hot, the sprouts were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots. ", "7": "Other seeds fell among the thorns, so when the seeds sprouted so did the thorns, crowding out the young plants so that they could produce no grain. ", "8": "But some of the seeds fell onto good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty\u2014and some even one hundred times as much as was planted! ", "9": "If you understand this, then you need to respond.\u201d[c]", "10": "Afterwards, Jesus, his disciples and those close to him remained behind to ask Jesus about his parables.

", "16": "The seed sown on gravel represents those who hear the Word and receive it joyfully, ", "17": "but because their hearts fail to sink a deep root into the Word, they don't endure for long. For when trouble or persecution comes on account of the Word, they immediately wilt and fall away.

Let me illustrate it with this parable. ", "31": "It is like the mustard seed, the tiniest of all the seeds, ", "32": "yet when it springs up and grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden.

{"1": "If I were to speak with eloquence in earth's many languages, and in the heavenly tongues of angels,[a] yet I didn't express myself with love,[b] my words would be reduced to the hollow sound of nothing more than a clanging cymbal.", "2": "And if I were to have the gift of prophecy[c] with a profound understanding of God's hidden secrets, and if I possessed unending supernatural knowledge, and if I had the greatest gift of faith that could move mountains,[d] but have never learned to love, then I am nothing.", "3": "And if I were to be so generous as to give away everything I owned to feed the poor, and to offer my body to be burned as a martyr,[e] without the pure motive of love, I would gain nothing of value.", "4": "Love is large and incredibly patient.[f] Love is gentle and consistently kind to all. It refuses to be jealous[g] when blessing comes to someone else. Love does not brag about one's achievements nor inflate its own importance. ", "5": "Love does not traffic in shame and disrespect, nor selfishly seek its own honor. Love is not easily irritated[h] or quick to take offense.[i] ", "6": "Love joyfully celebrates honesty[j] and finds no delight in what is wrong.[k] ", "7": "Love is a safe place of shelter,[l] for it never stops believing the best for others.[m] Love never takes failure as defeat, for it never gives up.", "8": "Love never stops loving.[n] It extends beyond the gift of prophecy, which eventually fades away.[o] It is more enduring than tongues, which will one day fall silent. Love remains long after words of knowledge are forgotten.[p] ", "9": "Our present knowledge and our prophecies are but partial,[q] ", "10": "but when love's perfection arrives, the partial will fade away.[r] ", "11": "When I was a child, I spoke about childish matters, for I saw things like a child and reasoned like a child. But the day came when I matured, and I set aside my childish ways.", "12": "For now we see but a faint reflection of riddles and mysteries[s] as though reflected in a mirror, but one day we will see face-to-face.[t] My understanding is incomplete now, but one day I will understand everything, just as everything about me has been fully understood. ", "13": "Until then, there are three things that remain: faith, hope, and love\u2014yet love surpasses them all.[u] So above all else, let love be the beautiful prize for which you run.[v]"}

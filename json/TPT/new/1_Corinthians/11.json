", "3": "But I want you to understand that Christ is the source[b] of every human alive, and Adam was the source of Eve,[c] and God is the source of the Messiah.", "4": "Any man who leads public worship,[d] and prays or prophesies with a shawl hanging down over his head, shows disrespect to his head, which is Christ. ", "5": "And if any woman in a place of leadership within the church prays or prophesies in public with her long hair disheveled,[e] she shows disrespect to her head, which is her husband, for this would be the same as having her head shaved. ", "6": "If a woman who wants to be in leadership will not conform to the customs of what is proper for women,[f] she might as well cut off her hair. But if it's disgraceful for her to have her hair cut off[g] or her head shaved, let her cover her head.", "7": "A man in leadership is under no obligation to have his head covered in the public gatherings, because he is the portrait of God and reflects his glory. The woman, on the other hand, reflects the glory of her husband, ", "8": "for man was not created from woman but woman from man.[h] ", "9": "By the same token, the man was not created because the woman needed him; the woman was created because the man needed her.[i] ", "10": "For this reason she should have authority over the head because of the angels.[j]", "11": "So then, I have to insist that in the Lord, neither is woman inferior to man nor is man inferior to woman.[k] ", "12": "For just as woman was taken from the side of man, in the same way man is taken from the womb of woman. God, as the source of all things, designed it this way.", "13": "So then you can decide for yourselves\u2014is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her hair unbound?[l] ", "14": "Doesn't our long-established cultural tradition teach us that if a man has long hair that is ornamentally arranged it invites disgrace, but if a woman has long hair that is ornamentally arranged it is her glory? ", "15": "This is because long hair is the endowment that God has given her as a head covering.[m]", "16": "If someone wants to quarrel about this, I want you to know that we have no intention[n] to start an argument, neither I nor the congregations of God.", "17": "Now, on this next matter, I wish I could commend you, but I cannot, because when you meet together as a church family it is doing more harm than good!

Don't you realize that you're showing a superior attitude by humiliating those who have nothing? Are you trying to show contempt for God's beloved church? How should I address this appropriately?

The same night in which he was handed over,[s] he took bread ", "24": "and gave thanks.

When I come to you, I will answer the other questions you asked me in your letter."}

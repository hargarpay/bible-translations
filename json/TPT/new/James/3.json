It corrupts the entire body[c] and is a hellish flame![d] It releases a fire that can burn throughout the course of human existence.[e]", "7": "For every wild animal on earth including birds, creeping reptiles, and creatures of the sea and land[f] have all been overpowered and tamed by humans, ", "8": "but the tongue is not able to be tamed.

", "2": "The kings of the earth have fornicated with her, and the people of earth are drunk on the wine of her prostitution.\u201d[a]", "3": "Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a wild, bloodred beast with seven heads and ten horns, and it was covered with blasphemous names. ", "4": "The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She was holding in her hand a golden chalice brimming full with defiling obscenities and the filth of her lewdness.[b] ", "5": "On her forehead was written these mysterious titles: \u201cThe great Babylon, mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.\u201d", "6": "I saw the woman was drunk with the blood of God's holy believers\u2014drunk on the blood of the loyal martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly astonished!", "7": "But the angel said to me, \u201cWhy are you so astonished? I will reveal to you the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. ", "8": "The wild beast you saw once was, now is not, and is destined to ascend out of the deep and go to destruction. All those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be utterly astonished when they see the wild beast because he once was, now is not, and is about to rise.", "9": "\u201cThis requires a mind that has wisdom to interpret: The seven heads of the beast are seven mountains the woman sits upon; they are also seven kings.

", "16": "The ten horns and the wild beast will hate the great prostitute and will make her a ruin. They will reduce her to nakedness, and they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire. ", "17": "For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose for her by agreeing to give their kingdom[g] to the wild beast until the words of God are fulfilled. ", "18": "As for the woman you saw, she is the great city Babylon, which rules[h] over the kings of the earth.\u201d"}

I know that you don't tolerate evil. You have tested those who claimed to be apostles and proved they are not, for they were imposters. ", "3": "I also know how you have bravely endured trials and persecutions because of my name, yet you have not become discouraged.[c] ", "4": "But I have this against you: you have abandoned the passionate love you had for me at the beginning.[d] ", "5": "Think about how far you have fallen! Repent[e] and do the works of love you did at first.[f] I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place of influence if you do not repent.

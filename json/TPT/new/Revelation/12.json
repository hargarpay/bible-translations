She was wearing on her head a victor's crown of twelve stars. ", "2": "She was pregnant and was crying out in labor pains, in the agony of giving birth.", "3": "Consider this: another astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven! I saw a huge, fiery-red dragon with ten horns and seven heads,[b] each wearing a royal crown. He was wearing seven royal crowns. ", "4": "The dragon's massive tail[c] swept across the sky and dragged away a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon crouched before the woman who was about to give birth\u2014poised to devour the baby the moment it was born.", "5": "She gave birth to a man-child who is about to rule and shepherd every nation with an iron scepter,[d] and her son was caught up to God and to his throne.

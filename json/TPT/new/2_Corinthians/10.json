{"1": "Now, please listen, for I need to address an issue. I'm making this personal appeal to you by the gentleness[a] and self-forgetfulness of Christ. I am the one who is \u201chumble and timid\u201d when face-to-face with you but \u201cbold and outspoken\u201d when a safe distance away.[b] ", "2": "Now I plead with you that when I come, don't force me to take a hard line with you (which I'm willing to do) by daring to confront[c] those who mistakenly believe that we are living by the standards of the world, not by the Spirit's wisdom and power. ", "3-4": "\u20134\u00a0For although we live in the natural realm, we don't wage a military campaign employing human weapons, using manipulation to achieve our aims. Instead, our spiritual weapons are energized with divine power to effectively dismantle the defenses behind which people hide.[d] ", "5": "We can demolish every deceptive fantasy[e] that opposes God and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of God. We capture, like prisoners of war, every thought[f] and insist that it bow in obedience to the Anointed One. ", "6": "Since we are armed with such dynamic weaponry, we stand ready to punish[g] any trace of rebellion, as soon as you choose complete obedience.[h]", "7": "You seem to always be looking at people by their outward appearances.[i] If someone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: we belong to Christ no less than he does. ", "8": "I am not ashamed, even if I've come across as one who has overstated the authority given to us by the Lord. For it is the authority to help build you up, not tear you down.

They compare themselves to one another[l] and make up their own standards to measure themselves by, and then they judge themselves by their own standards. What self-delusion! ", "13": "But we are those who choose to limit our boasting to only the measure of the work[m] to which God has appointed us\u2014a measure that, by the way, has reached as far as you. ", "14": "And since you are within our assigned limits, we didn't overstep our boundaries of authority by being the first to announce to you the wonderful news of the Anointed One. ", "15": "We're not trying to take credit for the ministry done by others, going beyond the limits God set for us. Instead, our hope soars as your faith continues to grow, causing a great expansion of our ministry among you.

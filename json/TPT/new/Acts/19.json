When they spoke evil[j] of the Way in front of the congregation, Paul withdrew from them and took the believers with him.", "10": "Every day[k] for over two years,[l] he taught them in the lecture hall of Tyrannus,[m] which resulted in everyone living in the province of Asia,[n] Jews and non-Jews, hearing the prophetic word of the Lord.[o]", "11": "God kept releasing a flow of extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul. ", "12": "Because of this, people took Paul's handkerchiefs and articles of clothing, even pieces of cloth that had touched his skin, laying them on the bodies of the sick, and diseases and demons left them and they were healed.", "13-14": "\u201314\u00a0Now, there were seven itinerant Jewish exorcists, sons of Sceva the high priest, who took it upon themselves to use the name and authority of Jesus over those who were demonized.

Great fear fell over the entire city, and the authority of the name of Jesus was exalted. ", "18": "Many believers publicly confessed their sins and disclosed their secrets. ", "19": "Large numbers of those who had been practicing magic took all of their books and scrolls of spells and incantations and publicly burned them. When the value of all the books and scrolls was calculated, it all came to several million dollars.[q] ", "20": "The power of God caused the word to spread, and the people were greatly impacted.[r]", "21": "Paul had it in his heart to go to Jerusalem and, on his way there, to revisit the places in Greece where he had ministered.[s] \u201cAfter that,\u201d he said, \u201cI have to go to Rome also.\u201d ", "22": "So he sent ahead into Macedonia two of his ministry assistants, Timothy[t] and Erastus,[u] while he remained in western Turkey.[v]", "23": "At that time a major disturbance erupted in Ephesus over the people following God's way.[w] ", "24": "It began with a wealthy man named Demetrius, who had built a large business and enriched many craftsmen by manufacturing silver shrines for the Greek goddess Artemis.[x]", "25-26": "\u201326\u00a0Demetrius called a meeting of his employees, along with all the various tradespeople of Ephesus, and said, \u201cYou know that our prosperous livelihood is being threatened by this Paul, who is persuading crowds of people to turn away from our gods.[y] We make a good living by doing what we do, but everywhere Paul goes, not only here in Ephesus but throughout western Turkey,[z] he convinces people that there's no such thing as a god made with hands.

And not only that, but the temple of our great goddess Artemis is being dishonored and seen as worthless.[aa] She is the goddess of all of western Turkey and is worshiped in all the world.

They shouted over and over, \u201cArtemis, the great goddess of the Ephesians!\u201d ", "29": "The entire city was thrown into chaos as everyone rushed into the stadium together,[ab] dragging with them Gaius[ac] and Aristarchus,[ad] Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.", "30": "When Paul attempted to go in and speak to the massive crowd, the disciples wouldn't let him.

For nearly two hours they shouted over and over, \u201cGreat is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!\u201d[af]", "35": "Eventually the mayor of the city[ag] was able to quiet them down. He said, \u201cFellow citizens! Who in the world doesn't know that we are devoted to the great temple[ah] of Artemis and to her image that fell from Zeus out of heaven?[ai] ", "36": "Since no one can deny it, you should all just be quiet. Calm down and don't do anything hasty. ", "37": "For you have brought these men before us who aren't guilty of any crime. They are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.

Absolutely not! You go back and tell the magistrates that they need to come down here themselves and escort us out!\u201d", "38": "When the officers went back and reported what Paul and Silas had told them, the magistrates were frightened, especially upon hearing that they had beaten two Roman citizens without due process.

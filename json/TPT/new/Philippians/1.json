We write this letter to all his devoted followers in your city, including your pastors,[b] and to all the servant-leaders[c] of the church. May the blessings of divine grace and supernatural peace that flow from God our wonderful Father, and our Messiah, the Lord Jesus, be upon your lives.", "3-4": "\u20134\u00a0My prayers for you are full of praise to God as I give him thanks for you with great joy! I'm so grateful for our union ", "5": "and our enduring partnership that began the first time I presented to you the gospel.

Many others have purer motives\u2014they preach with grace and love filling their hearts,[r] ", "16": "because they know I've been destined for the purpose of defending the revelation of God.[s]", "17": "Those who preach Christ with ambition and competition are insincere\u2014they just want to add to the hardships of my imprisonment. ", "18": "Yet in spite of all of this I am overjoyed! For what does it matter as long as Christ is being preached? If they preach him with mixed motives or with genuine love, the message of Christ is still being preached.

{"1": "After the Sabbath ended, at the first light of dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary[a] went to take a look at the tomb. ", "2-4": "\u20134\u00a0Suddenly, the earth shook violently beneath their feet as the angel of the Lord Jehovah[b] descended from heaven. Lightning flashed around him and his robe was dazzling white! The guards were stunned and terrified\u2014lying motionless like dead men. Then the angel walked up to the tomb, rolled away the stone, and sat on top of it!", "5": "The women were breathless and terrified, until the angel said to them, \u201cThere's no reason to be afraid. I know you're here looking for Jesus, who was crucified. ", "6": "He isn't here\u2014he has risen victoriously,[c] just as he said! Come inside the tomb and see the place where our Lord was lying.[d] ", "7": "Then run and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead! I give you his message: \u201cI am going ahead of you in Galilee and you will see me there.\u201d[e]", "8": "They rushed quickly to tell his disciples, and their hearts were deep in wonder and filled with great joy.", "9": "Along the way, Jesus suddenly appeared in front of them and said, \u201cRejoice!\u201d[f] They were so overwhelmed by seeing him that they bowed down and grasped his feet in adoring worship.", "10": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cThrow off all your fears. Go and tell my brothers[g] to go to Galilee. They will find me there.\u201d", "11": "After the women left the tomb, a few of the guards went into Jerusalem and told the chief priests everything they had seen and heard.

They bribed the guards with a large sum of money ", "13": "and told them, \u201cTell everyone, 'While we were asleep, his disciples came at night and stole his body!' ", "14": "If Pilate finds out about this, don't worry. We'll make sure you don't get blamed.\u201d ", "15": "So they took the money and did as they were told. (That is why the story of the guards is still circulated among the Jews to this day.)", "16": "Meanwhile, the eleven disciples heard the wonderful news from the women and left for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them. ", "17": "The moment they saw him, they worshiped him, but some still had lingering doubts.", "18": "Then Jesus came close to them and said, \u201cAll the authority of the universe has been given to me.[h] ", "19": "Now go in my authority and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. ", "20": "And teach them to faithfully follow[i] all that I have commanded you. And never forget that I am with you every day, even to the completion of this age.\u201d[j]"}

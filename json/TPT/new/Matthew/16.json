", "3": "And, 'Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.' You're so adept at forecasting the weather by looking at the sky, but you're absolutely clueless in reading the obvious signs of the times.

", "6": "Jesus spoke up and said, \u201cWatch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\u201d", "7": "Thinking Jesus was scolding them over not bringing bread, they whispered among themselves. ", "8": "Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, \u201cYou have such little faith! Why are you arguing with one another about having no bread? ", "9": "Are you so slow to understand? Have you forgotten the miracle of feeding the five thousand families and how each of you ended up with a basket full of fragments? ", "10": "And how seven loaves of bread fed four thousand families with baskets left over? ", "11": "Don't you understand? I'm not talking about bread, but I'm warning you to avoid the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\u201d", "12": "Then finally they realized he wasn't talking about yeast found in bread, but the error of the teachings of the Pharisees[c] and the Sadducees.[d]", "13": "When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi,[e] he asked his disciples this question: \u201cWhat are the people saying about me, the Son of Man?

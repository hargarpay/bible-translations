Your disciples shouldn't be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!\u201d", "3": "Jesus responded, \u201cHaven't you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry? ", "4": "They entered the house of God[c] and ate the sacred bread of God's presence,[d] violating the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat.", "5": "\u201cAnd haven't you read in the Torah that the priests violated the rules of the Sabbath by carrying out their duties in the temple on a Saturday, and yet they are without blame?

", "12": "Isn't a man much more valuable than a lamb? So of course, it's always proper to do miracles,[i] even on the Sabbath.\u201d", "13": "Then he turned to the man and said, \u201cHold out your hand!\u201d And as he stretched it out, it was restored, exactly like the other.", "14": "Immediately the Pharisees went out and started to scheme about how they would do away with him. ", "15": "Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he left by another way. Massive crowds followed him from there, and he healed all who were sick.

Jesus healed him instantly, and he could see and talk again! ", "23": "The crowds went wild with amazement as they witnessed this miracle.

And any family or community splintered by strife will fall apart. ", "26": "So if Satan casts out Satan, he is making war on himself. How then could his kingdom survive? ", "27": "So if Satan empowers me to cast out demons, who empowers your exorcists[s] to cast them out? Go ask them, for what they do proves you're wrong in your accusations.[t] ", "28": "On the other hand, if I drive out demons by the power of the Spirit of God, then the end of Satan's kingdom has come![u] ", "29": "Who would dare enter the house of a mighty man and steal his property?

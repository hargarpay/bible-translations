That's your problem.\u201d", "5": "Then Judas flung the silver coins inside the temple and went out and hanged himself.", "6": "The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, \u201cWe can't keep this, for it's unlawful to put blood money into the temple treasury.\u201d ", "7": "So after some deliberation, they decided to purchase the potter's field of clay,[b] to use as a cemetery for burying strangers.

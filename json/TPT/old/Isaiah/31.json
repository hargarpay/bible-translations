{"1": "Woe to those who run down to Egypt for help, trusting in the might of their multitude of cavalry, chariots, and riders. Their confident trust is not in the Holy One of Israel, nor do they consult with Yahweh.", "2": "Yet he is wiser than them all! He can call down calamity upon evildoers and never needs to retract his words. He will stand up against the wicked and those who protect them.", "3": "The Egyptians are not gods;[a] they're only human![b] Their horses are not supernatural; they're only flesh! When Yahweh demonstrates his power,[c] the helper will stumble and the helped will fall\u2014 both will perish together!", "4": "This is what Yahweh said to me: \u201cWhen a lion,[d] the great beast, growls[e] over his prey, and when the shepherds band together against him, the lion is neither terrified by their shouts nor disturbed by all the noise they make. So will Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, come down to fight for you on Mount Zion and on Zion's hill!", "5": "Just as a bird hovers over its nest to protect its young, so will Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, shield Jerusalem. He will protect her, deliver her, spare her, and rescue her!\u201d", "6": "\u201cPeople of Israel! Repent and turn back to God, whom you have deeply betrayed.", "7": "For a time is coming when all people will throw away their sinful idols of silver and gold and forsake all that their own hands have made.[f]", "8": "Assyria will fall by the sword but not the sword of man. It will not be man's sword that will slaughter them but God's! They will run from battle, and their young men will be made slaves.", "9": "Fear will cause them to surrender their high fortress,[g] and they will panic at the sight of princes, and desert their battle flag,\u201d says the Lord God of the fire that burns in Zion and whose furnace burns in Jerusalem!"}

{"1": "Woe to the pride of Israel's[a] drunkards, worn like a garland on their heads! Their glory is but wilted flowers, worn like a crown on the heads of those bloated with rich food and overcome by wine.", "2": "Behold! The Lord has one who is strong and mighty, and he will come like a hailstorm and like a destroying wind! With a storm of massive, flooding waters, his mighty power will knock it to the ground.[b]", "3": "That proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled underfoot,", "4": "and the glory of these proud leaders will fade and disappear like the first figs of the season, which are picked and eaten as soon they are ripe.", "5": "In that day, Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will be a crown of glory[c] and a diadem of beauty for the remnant of his people.", "6": "He will be a Spirit of justice for judges to render right decisions. And he will be strength and bravery for those who turn back the battle at the gate.", "7": "Moreover, the prophets and priests are drunk. They stagger because of wine and stumble around because of strong drink. They are confused[d] with wine, stumbling because of strong drink. They're too drunk to understand their prophetic visions. They're too drunk to render right decisions in judgment.", "8": "All of their banqueting tables are covered with filthy vomit; vomit is everywhere!", "9": "They say, \u201cWho does this prophet[e] think he is to try to teach us?

My hailstorm[s] will sweep away your refuge of lies, and my floodwaters will overwhelm your hiding place.", "18": "Then your covenant with death will be annulled and your pact with the underworld will not stand.

One drives the wagon's wheels over it, but his horses' hooves do not pulverize it.", "29": "This counsel also comes from Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.

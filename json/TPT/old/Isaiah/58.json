Declare to my people their rebellion and to Jacob's tribes their sin!", "2": "Yes, daily they seem to seek me, pretending that they delight to know my ways, as though they were a nation that does what is right and had not rejected the law of their God. They ask me to show them the right way, acting as though they are eager to be close to me.", "3": "They say, 'Why is it that when we fasted, you did not see it? We starved ourselves, and you didn't seem to notice.' \u201cBecause on the day you fasted you were seeking only your own desires, and you continue to exploit your workers.[a]", "4": "During your fasts, you quarrel and fight with others and strike them with an angry fist. When you fast like that, your voice will not be heard on high.", "5": "Do you think I'm impressed with that kind of fast?

Do you think I, Yahweh, will be pleased with that?[c]", "6": "\u201cThis is the kind of fast that I desire: Remove the heavy chains of oppression! Stop exploiting your workers![d] Set free the crushed and mistreated! Break off every yoke of bondage!", "7": "Share your food with the hungry! Provide for the homeless and bring them into your home!

He will fill you with refreshment even when you are in a dry, difficult place. He will continually restore strength to you, so you will flourish like a well-watered garden and like an ever-flowing, trustworthy spring of blessing.", "12": "Your people will rebuild long-deserted ruins, building anew on foundations laid long before you.[m] You will be known as Repairers of the Cities[n] and Restorers of Communities.[o]", "13": "\u201cIf you stop pursuing your own desires on my holy day, and refrain from disregarding the Sabbath, if you call the Sabbath a delightful pleasure and Yahweh's holy day honorable, if you honor it properly by not chasing your own desires, serving your own interests, and speaking empty words,", "14": "then you will find the joyous bliss that comes from serving Yahweh. And I will cause you to prosper and be carried triumphantly over the high places of the land.[p] You will enjoy the heritage of Jacob, your ancestor.\u201d Certainly the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it!"}

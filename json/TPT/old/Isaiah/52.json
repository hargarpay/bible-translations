Break off your shackles of bondage from your neck, you captive daughter of Zion!", "3": "For this is what Yahweh has to say: \u201cYou were sold for nothing; now you will be redeemed without any payment.\u201d", "4": "For Yahweh says: \u201cLong ago, my people went down to Egypt and lived as foreigners there, and for no good reason Assyria oppressed them.", "5": "And now, what have I here?\u201d says Yahweh. \u201cIndeed, my people have been taken into bondage without cause while mocking rulers howl; and every day my name is continually despised!\u201d[d] says Yahweh.", "6": "\u201cTherefore, my people will know the power of my name, and they will know in that day that I am the one who promised them, saying, 'Behold, I am here!'\u201c[e]", "7": "What a beautiful sight to behold\u2014 the precious feet of the messenger coming over the mountains to announce good news!

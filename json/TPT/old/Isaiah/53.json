He possessed no distinguishing beauty or outward splendor to catch our attention\u2014 nothing special in his appearance to make us desire him.", "3": "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of deep sorrows who was no stranger to suffering and grief.[d] We hid our faces from him in disgust and considered him a nobody, not worthy of respect.", "4": "Yet he was the one who carried our sicknesses[e] and endured the torment of our sufferings. We viewed him as one who was being punished[f] for something he himself had done, as one who was struck down by God and brought low.", "5": "But it was because of our rebellious deeds that he was pierced[g] and because of our sins that he was crushed. He endured the punishment that made us completely whole,[h] and in[i] his wounding[j] we found our healing.", "6": "Like wayward sheep, we have all wandered[k] astray. Each of us has turned from God's paths and chosen our own way; even so, Yahweh laid[l] the guilt of our every sin upon him.[m]", "7": "He was oppressed and harshly mistreated; still he humbly submitted, refusing to defend himself.

He was counted among the worst of sinners, yet he carried sin's burden for many[ag] and intercedes for those who are rebels.[ah]"}

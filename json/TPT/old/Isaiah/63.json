I am the one who announces righteousness, I am mighty and ready to save!\u201d[d]", "2": "Why are your robes so red, like those of one treading grapes?", "3": "\u201cI have been treading in the winepress alone, and there was no one there from the nations to help me. I stomped on the nations in my anger and trampled them down in my wrath. Their blood soaked my clothing and stained all my robes.", "4": "For a day of vengeance[e] was in my heart, and the time for my redeeming work had come.", "5": "I looked, but there was no one to help me. I was amazed that there was no one to support me. So my own power[f] accomplished salvation, and my wrath[g] sustained me.", "6": "So I trampled down nations in my anger and shattered them[h] in my fury and spilled their blood on the ground.\u201d", "7": "I will tell again of the faithful, gracious acts[i] of Yahweh and praise him for everything[j] he has done for us\u2014 the wonderful goodness,[k] the riches of his mercy, which he has shown to the house of Israel, and the abundance of his endless love.", "8": "For he said, \u201cTruly, they are my loyal children who will not act deceitfully.\u201d He became their Savior.[l]", "9": "When they suffered, he suffered with them. The Angel of His Presence[m] saved them. Out of his enduring love and compassion he redeemed them. He lifted them up, carried them in his arms,[n] and cared for them all the days of old.", "10": "But they rebelled against him and grieved his Holy Spirit.[o] Only then did he turn against them. He became their enemy and fought against them.", "11": "Then they remembered God's deeds in days past, the days of Moses and his people. And they asked: \u201cWhere now is Yahweh, who brought them miraculously through the Red Sea along with Moses, the shepherd-leader[p] of his flock, and put his Holy Spirit among them?[q]", "12": "Where now is the one who linked his magnificent power to Moses,[r] who divided the waters before them to gain everlasting fame for himself?", "13": "Who led them through the depths of the sea?

Even if our ancestors, Abraham and Jacob,[w] don't acknowledge us, you, O Yahweh, are our loving Father![x] From ancient times your name is our Redeemer.", "17": "Yahweh, why do you allow us[y] to wander from your ways and harden our hearts to be so stubborn that we do not obey you?[z] Please come back to us, for the sake of those who serve you, for the sake of your people, the tribes that are your inheritance.", "18": "For a short time your holy people possessed a holy place.[aa] But now our enemies have invaded and trampled down your sacred sanctuary.", "19": "You treat us as though we had never been your people, called by your name, or ruled by you."}

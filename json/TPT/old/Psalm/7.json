Can't you see how they want to rip me to shreds?", "3": "Lord, my God, if I were doing evil things, that would be different, for then I would be guilty, deserving all of this.", "4": "If I have wronged someone at peace with me, if I have betrayed a friend, repaying evil for good, or if I have unjustly harmed my enemy,", "5": "Then it would be right for you to let my enemy pursue and overtake me. In fact, let them grind me into the ground. Let them take my life from me and drag my dignity in the dust!

You have bent and strung your bow, making your judgment-arrows shafts of burning fire.", "14-15": "\u201315\u00a0Look how the wicked conceive their evil schemes. They go into labor with their lies and give birth to trouble. They dig a pit for others to fall into, not knowing that they will be the very ones who will fall into their own pit of failure.", "16": "For you, God, will see to it that every pit-digger who works to trap and harm others will be trapped and harmed by his own treachery.", "17": "But I will give all my thanks to you, Lord, for you make everything right in the end.

{"1": "Lord, you seem so far away when evil is near! Why do you stand so far off as though you don't care? Why have you hidden yourself when I need you the most?", "2": "The arrogant in their elitist pride persecute the poor and helpless. May you pour out upon them the very evil they've planned against others!", "3": "How they brag and boast of their cravings, exalting the greedy. They congratulate themselves as they despise you.", "4": "These arrogant ones, so smug and secure! In their delusion the wicked boast, saying, \u201cGod doesn't care about what we do. There's nothing to worry about! Our wealth will last a lifetime.\u201d", "5": "So seemingly successful are they in their schemes, prosperous in all their plans and scoffing at any restraint.", "6": "They boast that neither God nor men will bring them down. They sneer at all their enemies, saying in their hearts, \u201cWe'll have success in all we do and never have to face trouble\u201d\u2014 never realizing that they are speaking this in vain.", "7": "Their mouths spout out cursing, lies, and threats. Only trouble and turmoil come from all their plans.", "8-9": "\u20139\u00a0Like beasts lurking in the shadows of the city they crouch silently in ambush for the people to pass by. Pouncing on the poor, they catch them in their snare to murder their prey in secret as they plunder their helpless victims.", "10": "They crush the lowly as they fall beneath their brutal blows, watching their victims collapse in defeat!", "11": "Then they say to themselves, \u201cThe Lofty One is not watching while we do this. He doesn't even care! We can get away with it!\u201d", "12": "Now is the time to arise, Lord! Crush them once and for all! Don't forget the forgotten and the helpless.", "13": "How dare the wicked think they'll escape judgment, believing that you would not call them to account for all their ways. Don't let the wicked get away with their contempt of you!", "14": "Lord, I know you see all that they're doing, noting their each and every deed. You know the trouble and turmoil they've caused. Now punish them thoroughly for all that they've done! The poor and helpless ones trust in you, Lord, for you are famous for being the helper of the fatherless. I know you won't let them down.", "15": "Break the power of the wicked and all their strong-arm tactics. Search them out and destroy them for the evil things they've done.", "16": "You, Lord, are King forever and ever! You will see to it that all the nations perish from your land.", "17": "Lord, you know and understand all the hopes of the humble and will hear their cries and comfort their hearts, helping them all!", "18": "The orphans and the oppressed will be terrified no longer, for you will bring them justice, and no one will trouble them."}

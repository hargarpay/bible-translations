{"1": "King David's poetic song of instruction A prayer when he was confined in a cave God, I'm crying out to you! I lift up my voice boldly to beg for your mercy.", "2": "I spill out my heart to you and tell you all my troubles.", "3": "For when I was desperate, overwhelmed, and about to give up, you were the only one there to help. You gave me a way of escape from the hidden traps of my enemies.", "4": "I look to my left and right to see if there is anyone who will help, but there's no one who takes notice of me. I have no hope of escape, and no one cares whether I live or die.", "5": "So I cried out to you, Lord, my only hiding place. You're all I have, my only hope in this life, my last chance for help.", "6": "Please listen to my heart's cry, for I am low and in desperate need of you! Rescue me from all those who persecute me, for I am no match for them.", "7": "Bring me out of this dungeon so I can declare your praise! And all your godly lovers will celebrate all the wonderful things you've done for me!"}

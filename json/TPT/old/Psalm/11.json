{"1-2": "For the Pure and Shining One, by King David \u20132\u00a0Lord, don't you hear what my well-meaning friends keep saying to me: \u201cRun away while you can! Fly away like a bird to hide in the mountains for safety. For your enemies have prepared a trap for you! They plan to destroy you with their slander and deceitful lies. Can't you see them hiding in their place of darkness and shadows? They're set against you and all those who live upright lives.\u201d But don't they know, Lord, that I have made you my only hiding place? Don't they know that I always trust in you?", "3": "What can the righteous accomplish when truth's pillars are destroyed and law and order collapse?", "4": "Yet the Eternal One is never shaken\u2014[a] he is still found in his temple of holiness, reigning as Lord and King over all. He is closely watching everything that happens. And with a glance, his eyes examine every heart.[b] For his heavenly rule will prevail over all.", "5": "He will test both the righteous and the wicked, exposing each heart. God's very soul detests those who love to resort to violence.", "6": "He will rain down upon them judgment for their sins. A scorching wind will be their portion and lot in life.", "7": "But remember this: the Righteous Lord loves what is right and just, and every godly one will come into his presence and gaze upon his face!"}

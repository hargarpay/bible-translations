{"1": "A poetic song, by King David, the servant of the Lord The rebellion of sin speaks as an oracle of God, speaking deeply to the conscience of wicked men.[a] Yet they are still eager to sin, for the fear of God is not before their eyes.", "2": "See how they flatter themselves, unable to detect and detest their sins. They are crooked and conceited, convinced they can get away with anything.", "3": "Their wicked words are nothing but lies. Wisdom is far from them. Goodness is both forgotten and forsaken.", "4": "They lie awake at night to hatch their evil plots, always planning their schemes of darkness, and never once do they consider the evil of their ways.", "5": "But you, O Lord, your mercy-seat love is limitless, reaching higher than the highest heavens. Your great faithfulness is infinite, stretching over the whole earth.", "6": "Your righteousness is unmovable, just like the mighty mountains. Your judgments are as full of wisdom as the oceans are full of water. Your tender care and kindness leave no one forgotten, not a man nor even a mouse.", "7": "O God, how extravagant is your cherishing love! All mankind can find a hiding place[b] under the shadow of your wings.", "8": "All may drink of the anointing[c] from the abundance of your house. All may drink their fill from the delightful springs of Eden.[d]", "9": "To know you is to experience a flowing fountain, drinking in your life, springing up to satisfy. In your light we receive the light of revelation.[e]", "10": "Lord, keep pouring out your unfailing love on those who are near you. Release more of your blessings to those who are loyal to you.", "11": "Don't let these proud boasters trample me down; don't let them push me around by the sheer strength of their wickedness.", "12": "There they lie in the dirt, these evil ones, thrown down to the ground, never to arise again!"}

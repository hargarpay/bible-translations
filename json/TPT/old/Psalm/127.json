{"1": "A song of the stairway, by King Solomon If God's grace doesn't help the builders, they will labor in vain to build a house. If God's mercy doesn't protect the city, all the sentries will circle it in vain.", "2": "It really is senseless to work so hard from early morning till late at night, toiling to make a living for fear of not having enough. God can provide for his lovers even while they sleep!", "3": "Children are God's love-gift; they are heaven's generous reward.", "4": "Children born to a young couple will one day rise to protect and provide for their parents.[a]", "5": "Happy will be the couple who has many of them! A household full of children will not bring shame on your name but victory when you face your enemies, for your offspring will have influence and honor[b] to prevail on your behalf!"}

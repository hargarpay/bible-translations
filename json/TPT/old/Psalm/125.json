{"1": "A song of the stairway Those who trust in the Lord are as unshakeable, as unmovable as mighty Mount Zion!", "2": "Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord's wrap-around presence surrounds his people, protecting them now and forever.", "3": "The wicked will not always rule over the godly, provoking them to do what is evil.", "4": "God, let your goodness be given away to your good people, to all your godly lovers!", "5": "But those who turn away from truth, you will turn them away from you, to follow their crooked ways. You will give them just what they deserve. May Israel experience peace and prosperity!"}

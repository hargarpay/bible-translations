My innermost being will praise you, Lord!", "2": "I will spend my life praising you and singing high praises to you, my God, every day of my life!", "3-4": "\u20134\u00a0We can never look to men for help; no matter who they are, they can't save us, for even our great leaders fail and fall. They too are just mortals who will one day die. At death the spirits of all depart and their bodies return to dust. In the day of their death all their projects and plans are over.", "5": "But those who hope in the Lord will be happy and pleased! Our help comes from the God of Jacob!", "6": "You keep all your promises. You are the Creator of heaven's glory, earth's grandeur, and ocean's greatness.", "7": "The oppressed get justice with you. The hungry are satisfied with you. Prisoners find their freedom with you.", "8": "You open the eyes of the blind and you fully restore those bent over with shame. You love those who love and honor you.", "9": "You watch over strangers and immigrants and support the fatherless and widows. But you subvert the plans of the ungodly.", "10": "Lord, you will reign forever! Zion's God will rule throughout time and eternity! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!"}

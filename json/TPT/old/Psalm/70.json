God, show me your favor and restore me.", "2": "Let all who seek my life be humiliated, confused, and ashamed. God, send them sprawling, all who wish me evil; they just want me dead.", "3": "Scoff at every scoffer and cause them all to be utter failures! Let them be ashamed and horrified over their complete defeat.", "4": "But let all who passionately seek you erupt with excitement and joy over what you've done! Let all your lovers, who continually rejoice in the Savior,[a] say aloud, \u201cHow great and glorious is our God!\u201d", "5": "Lord, in my place of weakness and need, won't you turn your heart toward me and hurry to help me? For you are my Savior and I'm always in your thoughts. So don't delay to deliver me now, for you are my God."}

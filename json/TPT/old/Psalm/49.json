Both rich and poor together, all over the world\u2014 everyone listen to what I have to say!", "3": "For wisdom will come from my mouth; words of insight and understanding will be heard from the musings of my heart.", "4": "I will break open mysteries with my music, and my song will release riddles solved.", "5": "There's no reason to fear when troubling times come, even when you're surrounded with problems and persecutors who chase at your heels.[a]", "6-7": "\u20137\u00a0They trust in their treasures and boast in their riches, yet not one of them, though rich as a king, could rescue his own brother from the guilt of his sins. Not one could give God the ransom price for the soul of another, let alone for himself.", "8-9": "\u20139\u00a0A soul's redemption is too costly and precious for anyone to pay with earthly wealth. The price to pay is never enough to purchase eternal life for even one, to keep them out of hell.", "10-11": "\u201311\u00a0The brightest and best, along with the foolish and senseless, God sees that they all will die one day, leaving their houses and wealth to others. Even though they name streets and lands after themselves,[b] hoping to have their memory endure beyond the grave, legends in their own minds, their home address is now the cemetery!", "12": "The honor of man is short-lived and fleeting.

{"1": "A song of the stairway, by King David Lord, my heart is meek before you. I don't consider myself better than others. I'm content to not pursue matters that are over my head\u2014 such as your complex mysteries and wonders\u2014 that I'm not yet ready to understand.", "2": "I am humbled and quieted in your presence. Like a contented child who rests on its mother's lap,[a] I'm your resting child and my soul is content in you.", "3": "O people of God,[b] your time has come to quietly trust, waiting upon the Lord now and forever."}

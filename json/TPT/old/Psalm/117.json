{"1": "A praise psalm Let everyone everywhere shine with praise to Yahweh![a] Let it all out! Go ahead and praise him!", "2": "For he has conquered us with his great love and his kindness has melted our hearts. His faithfulness lasts forever and he will never fail you. So go ahead, let it all out! Praise Yah! O Yah![b]"}

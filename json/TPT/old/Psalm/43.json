Let them comfort and gently lead me onto the shining path, showing the way into your burning presence, into your many sanctuaries of holiness.", "4": "Then I will come closer to your very altar until I come before you, the God of my ecstatic joy! I will praise you with the harp that plays in my heart, to you, my God, my magnificent God!", "5": "Then I will say to my soul, \u201cDon't be discouraged; don't be disturbed, for I fully expect my Savior-God to break through for me. Then I'll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over again.\u201d Yes, living before his face is my saving grace!"}

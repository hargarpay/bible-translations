Keep me safe from all my enemies, for they're coming to kill me. Put me in a high place out of their reach\u2014 a place so high that these assassins will never find me.", "2": "Save me from these murdering men, these bloodthirsty killers.", "3": "See how they set an ambush for my life. They're fierce men ready to launch their attack against me. O Lord, I'm innocent; protect me!", "4": "I've done nothing to deserve this, yet they are already plotting together to kill me. Arise, Lord, see what they're scheming, and come and meet with me.", "5": "Awaken, O God of Israel! Commander of Angel Armies, arise to punish these treacherous people who oppose you!

At each and every sunrise, my lyrics of your love will fill the air! For you have been my glory-fortress, a stronghold in my day of distress.", "17": "O my strength, I sing with joy your praises. O my stronghold, I sing with joy your song! O my Savior, I sing with joy the lyrics of your faithful love for me!"}

How perfectly you lead us, a people set free.[a] Loving shepherd of Israel\u2014listen to our hearts' cry! Shine forth from your throne of dazzling light.", "2": "In the sight of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh, stir up your mighty power in full display before our eyes.[b] Break through and reveal yourself by coming to our rescue.", "3": "Revive us, O God! Let your beaming face shine upon us with the sunrise rays of glory; then nothing will be able to stop us.", "4": "O God, the mighty Commander of Angel Armies, how much longer will you smolder in anger? How much longer will you be disgusted with your people even when they pray?", "5": "You have fed us with sorrow and grief and made us drink our tears by the bowlful.", "6": "You've made us a thorn in the side of all the neighboring lands, and now they just laugh at us with their mocking scorn.", "7": "Come back, come back, O God, and restore us!

Revive us again, that we may trust in you.", "19": "O God, the mighty Commander of Angel Armies, come back and rescue us! Let your beaming face shine upon us with the sunrise rays of glory.

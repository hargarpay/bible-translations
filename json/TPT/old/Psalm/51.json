Forgive the full extent of my rebellious ways, and erase this deep stain on my conscience.[b]", "3-4": "\u20134\u00a0For I'm so ashamed. I feel such pain and anguish within me. I can't get away from the sting of my sin against you, Lord! Everything I did, I did right in front of you, for you saw it all. Against you, and you above all, have I sinned. Everything you say to me is infallibly true and your judgment conquers me.", "5": "Lord, I have been a sinner from birth, from the moment my mother conceived me.", "6": "I know that you delight to set your truth deep in my spirit.[c] So come into the hidden places of my heart and teach me wisdom.", "7": "Purify my conscience!

{"1": "For the Pure and Shining One A song for the end, sung for the new day by King David No, Lord! Don't condemn me. Don't punish me in your fiery anger.", "2": "Please deal gently with me, Yahweh; show me mercy, for I'm sick and frail. I'm fading away with weakness. Heal me, for I'm falling apart.", "3": "How long until you take away this pain in my body and in my soul? Lord, I'm trembling in fear!", "4": "Yahweh, return to me and deliver my life because I know your faithful love is toward me.", "5": "How can I be any good to you dead? For graveyards sing no songs. In the darkness of death who remembers you? How could I bring you praise if I'm buried in a tomb?", "6": "I'm exhausted and worn out with my weeping. I endure weary, sleepless nights filled with moaning, soaking my pillow with my tears.", "7": "My eyes of faith won't focus anymore, for sorrow fills my heart. There are so many enemies who come against me!", "8": "Go away! Leave me, all you troublemakers! For the Lord has turned to listen to my thunderous cry.", "9": "Yes! Yahweh my healer has heard all my pleading and has taken hold of my prayers and answered them all.", "10": "Now it's my enemies who have been shamed. Terror-stricken, they will turn back again, knowing the bitterness of sudden disgrace!"}

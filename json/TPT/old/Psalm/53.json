God looks over all of Adam's sons and daughters, looking to see if there are any who are wise with insight\u2014 any who search for him, wanting to please him.", "3": "But no, all have wandered astray, walking stubbornly toward evil. Not one is good; he can't even find one!", "4": "Look how they live in luxury while exploiting my people. Won't these workers of wickedness ever learn! They never even think of praying to God.", "5": "Soon, unheard-of terror will seize them while in their sins. God himself will one day scatter the bones of those who rose up against you.[c] Doomed and rejected, they will be put to shame, for God has despised them.", "6": "Oh, I wish our time of rescue were already here. Oh, that God would come forth now\u2014[d] arising from the midst of his Zion-people to save and restore his very own. When God fully restores his people, Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be filled with gladness!"}

{"1": "David's poetic praise to God I'm pleading with you, Lord, help me![a] Don't close your ears to my cry, for you're my defender. If you continue to remain aloof and refuse to answer me, I might as well give up and die.", "2": "Can't you see me turning toward your mercy seat as I lift my hands in surrendered prayer? Now, Lord, please listen to my cry.", "3": "Don't allow me to be punished along with the wicked\u2014 these hypocrites who speak sweetly to their neighbors' faces while holding evil against them in their hearts.", "4": "Go ahead and punish them as they deserve. Let them be paid back for all their evil plans in proportion to their wickedness.", "5": "Since they don't care anything about you, or about the great things you've done, take them down like an old building being demolished, never again to be rebuilt.", "6": "But may your name be blessed and built up! For you have answered my passionate cry for mercy.", "7": "You are my strength and my shield from every danger. When I fully trust in you, help is on the way. I jump for joy and burst forth with ecstatic, passionate praise! I will sing songs of what you mean to me!", "8": "You will be the inner strength of all your people, the mighty protector of all, the saving strength for all your anointed ones.", "9": "Keep protecting and cherishing your chosen ones; in you they will never fall. Like a shepherd going before us, keep leading us forward, forever carrying us in your arms!"}

And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.", "3": "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.", "4": "And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Rise up, follow after those men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?", "5": "Is this not the one in which my lord drinks and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil in so doing.", "6": "When he overtook them, he spoke unto them these same words.", "7": "And they said unto him, Why saith my lord these words? In no wise should thy slaves do according to this thing.", "8": "Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?", "9": "With whoever of thy slaves it is found, both let him die and we also will be my lord's bond slaves.", "10": "And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and ye shall be blameless.", "11": "Then they made haste, and each one took his sack down to the ground, and each one opened his sack.", "12": "And he searched and began at the eldest and finished at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.", "13": "Then they rent their clothes, and each one laded his ass, and they returned to the city.", "14": "And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, for he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.", "15": "And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?", "16": "Then Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? What shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy slaves; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup is found.", "17": "And he said, in no wise should I do so; but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my slave; and as for you, go up in peace unto your father.", "18": "\u00b6 Then Judah came near unto him and said, Oh my lord, let thy slave, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy slave; for thou art even as Pharaoh.", "19": "My lord asked his slaves, saying, Have ye a father or a brother?", "20": "And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a young man of his old age, yet a lad; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.", "21": "And thou didst say unto thy slaves, Bring him down unto me that I may set my eyes upon him.", "22": "And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.", "23": "And thou didst say unto thy slaves, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, ye shall see my face no more.", "24": "And it came to pass when we came up unto thy slave my father, we told him the words of my lord.", "25": "And our father said, Go again and buy us a little food.", "26": "And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.", "27": "Then thy slave my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;", "28": "and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since;", "29": "and if ye take this one also from me and some disaster should befall him, ye shall bring my gray hairs with sorrow down to Sheol.", "30": "Now therefore when I come to thy slave my father, and the lad is not with us, seeing that his soul is bound up in the lad's soul,", "31": "it shall come to pass when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy slaves shall bring the gray hairs of thy slave our father down with sorrow to Sheol.", "32": "For thy slave became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the sin before my father for ever.", "33": "Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy slave remain instead of the lad as a bond slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.", "34": "For how shall I go up to my father and the lad not be with me? I cannot go lest I see the evil that shall come on my father."}

{"1": "\u00b6 And the LORD spoke unto Moses and Aaron, saying,", "2": "When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it is in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron, the priest, or unto one of his sons, the priests,", "3": "and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh, and if the hair in the plague is turned white and the plague looks deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall recognize him and pronounce him unclean.", "4": "If the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh and looks to be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof is not turned white; then the priest shall shut up the one that has the plague seven days;", "5": "and the priest shall look on him the seventh day and see if the plague in his sight is stayed and the plague is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days the second time.", "6": "After this the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and see if the plague has darkened and that the plague is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is but a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.", "7": "But if the scab spreads much abroad in the skin after he has been shown unto the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again;", "8": "and if the priest recognizes that the scab has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.", "9": "When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;", "10": "and the priest shall see him; and if the rising looks white in the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is quick raw flesh in the rising,", "11": "it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.", "12": "But if the leprosy breaks out abroad in the skin and the leprosy covers all the skin of him that has the plague from his head even to his feet wherever the priest looks,", "13": "then the priest shall consider; and if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the one that has the plague clean; it is all turned white; he is clean.", "14": "But the day that raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.", "15": "And the priest shall see the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean, for the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.", "16": "But when the raw flesh turns again and is changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;", "17": "and the priest shall see him;

yet he is clean.", "41": "And if his hair has fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.", "42": "But if in the bald head, or bald forehead, there is a white reddish sore, it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.", "43": "Then the priest shall look upon it; and if the rising of the sore is white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh,", "44": "he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.", "45": "And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent and his head uncovered, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.", "46": "All the days in which the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he shall be unclean; he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be.", "47": "\u00b6 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment;", "48": "whether it is in the warp or woof; of linen or of woolen; whether in a skin or in anything made of skin;", "49": "and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin, it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shown unto the priest.", "50": "And the priest shall look upon the plague and shut up the thing that has the plague seven days.", "51": "And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in a skin or in any work that is made of skins; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.", "52": "He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is;

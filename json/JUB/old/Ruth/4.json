And he came and sat down.", "2": "Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.", "3": "And he said unto the redeemer, Naomi, that is come again out of the field of Moab, sold a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's,", "4": "and I decided to cause thee to know this and tell thee to take it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it, but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is no one to redeem it besides thee, and I after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.", "5": "Then Boaz replied, The day that thou dost receive the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must also receive Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.", "6": "And the redeemer said, I cannot redeem it for myself lest I ruin my own inheritance; redeem thou; I cede my right to you, for I shall not be able to redeem it.", "7": "Now for a long time in Israel there had been this custom concerning redemption or contracts, that for the confirmation of all matters: one plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour, and this was a testimony in Israel.", "8": "Therefore, the former owner of the right of redemption said unto Boaz, Buy it thyself. So he drew off his shoe.", "9": "\u00b6 And Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.", "10": "Moreover, I also take Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place. Ye shall be witnesses of this today.", "11": "And all the people that were in the gate and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, who built the house of Israel; and be thou a man of valour in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem;", "12": "let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.", "13": "\u00b6 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife, and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.", "14": "And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, who has not left thee this day without a redeemer, whose name shall be famous in Israel.", "15": "And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy soul and a sustainer in thy old age, for thy daughter-in-law, whom thou doth love, who is better to thee than seven sons, has given birth.", "16": "And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and was his nurse.", "17": "And the women, her neighbours, named him, saying, There is a son born to Naomi, and they called his name Obed. This is the father of Jesse, the father of David.", "18": "Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,", "19": "and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,", "20": "and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,", "21": "and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,", "22": "and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."}

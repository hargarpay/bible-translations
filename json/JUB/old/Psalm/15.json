{"1": "\u00b6 LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in the mountain of thy holiness?", "2": "He that walks in integrity and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.", "3": "He that does not backbite with his tongue nor does evil to his neighbour nor takes up a reproach against his neighbour.", "4": "In whose eyes the vile person is not esteemed; but he honours those that fear the LORD. He that swears to his own hurt and does not change.", "5": "He that does not put out his money to usury nor takes a bribe against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved."}

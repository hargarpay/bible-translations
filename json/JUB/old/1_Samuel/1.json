{"1": "\u00b6 Now there was a certain man of Ramath of Zophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.", "2": "And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.", "3": "And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of the hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.", "4": "And when the day would come, Elkanah would sacrifice, and he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.", "5": "But unto Hannah he would give a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah, even though the LORD had shut up her womb.", "6": "And her rival provoked her to anger and sorrow because the LORD had shut up her womb.", "7": "And this would happen year by year when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she would provoke her; therefore, she would weep and not eat.", "8": "Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her, Hannah, why dost thou weep? And why dost thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am I not better to thee than ten sons?", "9": "\u00b6 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.", "10": "And she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the LORD and wept sore;", "11": "and she vowed a vow and said, O LORD of the hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.", "12": "And it came to pass as she continued praying before the LORD that Eli was observing her mouth.", "13": "Now Hannah spoke in her heart and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore, Eli thought she was drunk.", "14": "And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.", "15": "And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the LORD.", "16": "Do not count thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have waited until now to speak.", "17": "Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.", "18": "And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no longer sad.", "19": "\u00b6 And they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the LORD and returned and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.", "20": "Therefore, it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, she bore a son and called his name Samuel,[a] saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.", "21": "And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the LORD the accustomed sacrifice and his vow.", "22": "But Hannah did not go up, for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him that he may be presented before the LORD and abide there for ever.", "23": "And Elkanah, her husband, said unto her, Do what seems good unto thee; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only let the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him.", "24": "And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child was young.", "25": "And they slew a bullock and brought the child to Eli.", "26": "And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.", "27": "For this child I prayed, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him.", "28": "Therefore, I also have given him back to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall belong to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there."}

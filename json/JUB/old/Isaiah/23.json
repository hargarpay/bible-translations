Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in; from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.", "2": "Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou mart of Zidon, that by passing over the sea thou wert replenished.", "3": "Her provision was from the plantings that grow with the many waters of the Nile, of the harvest of the river. She was also the mart of the Gentiles.", "4": "Be thou ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I have never travailed nor brought forth children, neither did I nourish up young men nor bring up virgins.", "5": "When the report comes unto Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the news from Tyre.", "6": "Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.", "7": "Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.", "8": "Who has decreed this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honourable of the earth?", "9": "The LORD of the hosts has purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring down all those who are exalted in the earth.", "10": "Pass by as a river from thy land, O daughter of Tarshish; for thou shalt have no more strength.", "11": "He stretched out his hand over the sea; he shook the kingdoms; the LORD commanded upon Canaan that her strength should be weakened.", "12": "And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon; arise, pass over to Chittim, and even there thou shalt have no rest.", "13": "Behold the land of the Chaldeans.

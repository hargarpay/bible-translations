As the whirlwinds which pass through the wilderness in the land of the south, so they come from the terrible land.", "2": "A grievous vision is shown unto me. For one who is treacherous, another who deals treacherously, and for one destroyer, another destroyer. Rise up, Elam; besiege Media; all the sighing thereof I have made to cease.", "3": "Therefore my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travails; I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.", "4": "My heart panted; the horror frightened me; the night of my pleasure he has turned into fear unto me.", "5": "Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink; arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.", "6": "For thus has the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman who shall declare what he sees.", "7": "And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; then he looked with more diligence;", "8": "and he cried, A lion upon the watchman. My lord, I stand continually all the day and all night long upon my watchtower.", "9": "And, behold, this chariot of men comes with a couple of horsemen.

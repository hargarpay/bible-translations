And I set a great assembly against them.", "8": "And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren, the Jews who had been sold unto the Gentiles; and will ye even sell your brethren? And shall they be sold unto us? Then they remained silent, for they had nothing to answer.", "9": "Also I said, What you do is not good, do you not walk in the fear of our God, that ye not be the reproach of our enemies the Gentiles?", "10": "I, likewise, and my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and grain; let us now release them from this burden.", "11": "Restore, I pray you, to them, today, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, and even the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.", "12": "Then they said, We will return it and will require nothing of them; so we will do as thou sayest.

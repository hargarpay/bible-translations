And he said unto him, I am escaped out of the camp of Israel.", "4": "And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people fell and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead also.", "5": "And David said unto the young man that told him, How dost thou know that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?", "6": "And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear, and the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.", "7": "And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.", "8": "And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.", "9": "He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me and slay me, for anguish is come upon me, and all my soul is yet in me.", "10": "So I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen, and I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them here unto my lord.", "11": "\u00b6 Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him.", "12": "And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.", "13": "And David said unto the young man that told him, From where art thou?

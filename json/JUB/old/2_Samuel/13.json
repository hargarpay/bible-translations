{"1": "\u00b6 And it came to pass after this that Absalom, the son of David, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar, and Amnon, the son of David, loved her.", "2": "And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and Amnon thought it difficult for him to do any thing to her.", "3": "But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, and Jonadab was a very astute man.", "4": "And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, becoming thinner from day to day? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.", "5": "And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed and pretend to be sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come and give me food and make the food in my sight that I may see it and eat it at her hand.", "6": "So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and when the king came to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar, my sister, come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat at her hand.", "7": "Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house and make him something to eat.", "8": "So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was lying down. And she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.", "9": "Then she took a pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send everyone out from me. And they all went out from him.", "10": "Then Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon, her brother.", "11": "And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.", "12": "And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not commit this folly.", "13": "And I, where shall I go with my reproach? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now, therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.", "14": "Howbeit, he would not hearken unto her voice, but, being stronger than she, forced her and lay with her.", "15": "Then Amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.", "16": "And she said unto him, There is no cause; this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.", "17": "Then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said, Put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her.", "18": "And she had a garment of different colours upon her, for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.", "19": "And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of different colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying.", "20": "And Absalom, her brother, said unto her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? But now remain silent, my sister; he is thy brother; do not regard this thing in thy heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.", "21": "\u00b6 But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.", "22": "And Absalom spoke neither good nor bad unto his brother Amnon, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced his sister Tamar.", "23": "And it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.", "24": "And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold now, thy slave has sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his slaves go with thy slave.", "25": "And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him; however, he would not go but blessed him.", "26": "Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?", "27": "But because Absalom pressed him, he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.", "28": "Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant.", "29": "And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and they all got upon their mules and fled.", "30": "\u00b6 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the rumour came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.", "31": "Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth; and all his slaves stood by with their clothes rent.", "32": "And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Do not let my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men, the king's sons, for only Amnon is dead, for by the mouth of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.", "33": "Now, therefore, do not let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.", "34": "But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there came many people by the way of the side of the mountain behind him.", "35": "And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come; as thy slave said, so it is.", "36": "And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his slaves wept very sore.", "37": "But Absalom fled and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.", "38": "So after Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he was there three years.", "39": "And King David longed to see Absalom, for he was now comforted concerning Amnon, who was dead."}

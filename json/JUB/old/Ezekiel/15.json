{"1": "\u00b6 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:", "2": "Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree? What is the branch among the trees of the forest?", "3": "Shall wood be taken from it to do a work? Will men take a peg from it to hang any vessel thereon?", "4": "Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?", "5": "Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work; how much less afterward shall it be meet for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?", "6": "Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I have given over the inhabitants of Jerusalem.", "7": "And I will set my face against them; they came out of one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD when I set my face against them.", "8": "And I will make the land desolate because they have completely rebelled, said the Lord GOD."}

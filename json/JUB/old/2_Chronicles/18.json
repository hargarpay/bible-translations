And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.", "3": "And Ahab, king of Israel, said unto Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.", "4": "\u00b6 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.", "5": "Therefore, the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for God will deliver it into the king's hand.", "6": "But Jehoshaphat said, Is there yet here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire by him?", "7": "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man here, by whom we may enquire of the LORD, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good unto me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah, the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.", "8": "So the king of Israel called for a eunuch and said, Bring quickly Micaiah, the son of Imla.", "9": "And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, were each sitting on their thrones, clothed in their robes, and they sat in the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.", "10": "And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, had made himself horns of iron and said, Thus hath the LORD said, With these thou shalt push Syria until they are consumed.", "11": "And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead and be prospered, for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.", "12": "And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.", "13": "And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, that what my God says, that will I speak.", "14": "And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and ye shall be prospered; they shall be delivered into your hands.", "15": "And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?", "16": "Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, These have no master; let each one return to his house in peace.", "17": "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?", "18": "So he said, Therefore, hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on his right hand and on his left.", "19": "And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab, king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.", "20": "Then a spirit came out and stood before the LORD and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, In what manner?", "21": "And he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the LORD said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail; go out and do even so.", "22": "Now, therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD has decreed evil concerning thee.", "23": "Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and smote Micaiah upon the cheek and said, Which way did the Spirit of the LORD depart from me to speak unto thee?", "24": "And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.", "25": "Then the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and carry him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son", "26": "and say, Thus hath the king said, Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I return in peace.", "27": "And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then the LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye peoples.", "28": "\u00b6 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramothgilead.", "29": "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself to enter into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself and entered into the battle.", "30": "Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight not with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.", "31": "And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore, they compassed about him to fight; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God separated them from him.", "32": "And when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they withdrew from pursuing him.", "33": "But a certain man drew a bow in all his perfection and smote the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail; therefore, he said to his chariot man, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the camp, for I am wounded.", "34": "And the battle increased that day; howbeit, the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening, and about the time of the sun going down he died."}

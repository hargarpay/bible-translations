{"1": "\u00b6 Then I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold a flying roll.", "2": "And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.", "3": "Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth; for every one that steals (as it is written on one side of the roll) shall be destroyed; and every one that swears (as it is written on the other side of the roll) shall be destroyed.", "4": "I brought it forth, said the LORD of the hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name; and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.", "5": "\u00b6 Then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goes forth.", "6": "And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah to measure wheat that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance in all the earth.", "7": "And, behold, they lifted up a talent of lead, and a woman was sitting in the midst of that ephah.", "8": "And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.", "9": "Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.", "10": "Then I said to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?", "11": "And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base."}

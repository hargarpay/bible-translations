And I said, I have looked and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps upon the lampstand, and seven pipes for the lamps, which are upon the top thereof:", "3": "and two olive trees over it, one upon the right hand side of the bowl and the other upon the left hand side thereof.", "4": "So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What is this, my lord?", "5": "Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Dost thou not know what this is? And I said, No, my lord.", "6": "Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, said the LORD of the hosts.", "7": "Who art thou, O great mountain before Zerubbabel?

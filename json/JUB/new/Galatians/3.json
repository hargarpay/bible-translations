No, in no wise, for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.", "22": "But the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believers.", "23": "But before faith came, we were under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.", "24": "Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.", "25": "But when faith is come, we are no longer under the hand of the schoolmaster.", "26": "For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.", "27": "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.", "28": "Here there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.", "29": "And if ye are Christ's, then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise."}

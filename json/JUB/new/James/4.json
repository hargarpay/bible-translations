Is it not from here, that is to say, of your lusts which fight in your members?", "2": "Ye covet and have not; ye murder, and have envy and cannot obtain; ye fight and war and have not that which ye desire because ye ask not.", "3": "Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your pleasures.", "4": "Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?

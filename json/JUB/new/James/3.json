{"1": "\u00b6 My brethren, make not unto yourselves many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.", "2": "For we all offend in many things. If any man offends not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to govern the whole body with restraint.", "3": "Behold, we put bits (or restraint) in the horses' mouths to persuade them, and we govern their whole body.", "4": "Behold also the ships, which though they are so great are driven of fierce winds, yet they are governed with a very small rudder, wherever the governor desires.", "5": "In the same manner, the tongue is a very small member and boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!", "6": "And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our nature; and it is set on fire of hell.", "7": "For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of beings in the sea may be tamed and is tamed by mankind,", "8": "but no man can tame the tongue, which is an evil that cannot be restrained and is full of deadly poison.", "9": "With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.", "10": "Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.", "11": "Does a fountain send forth at the same place both sweet and bitter water?", "12": "Can the fig tree, my brethren, produce olive berries? or the vine, figs?

Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?", "6": "But brother goes to judgment against brother, and that before the unbelievers.", "7": "Now therefore there is certainly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather suffer the wrong? why do ye not rather be defrauded?", "8": "But ye do wrong and defraud and do this to your brothers.", "9": "\u00b6 Know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

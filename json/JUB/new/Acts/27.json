And Julius courteously entreated Paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.", "4": "And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary.", "5": "And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.", "6": "And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, and he put us in it.", "7": "And when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone,", "8": "and, passing it with difficulty, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.", "9": "Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,", "10": "saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.", "11": "Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.", "12": "\u00b6 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, many were in agreement to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice and winter there, which is a port of Crete and lies toward Africa and the west.", "13": "And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising sails, they sailed close by Crete.", "14": "But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.[a]", "15": "And when the ship was caught up by it and could not resist against the wind, the ship was taken by the wind and drifted.", "16": "And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat,", "17": "Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship;

{"1-3": "Have done, then, with all evil and deceit, all pretence and jealousy and slander. You are babies, new-born in God's family, and you should be crying out for unadulterated spiritual milk to make you grow up to salvation! And so you will, if you have already tasted the goodness of the Lord.", "4-6": "To change the metaphor, you come to him, as living stones to the immensely valuable living stone (which men rejected but God chose), to be built up into a spiritual House of God, in which you, like holy priests, can offer those spiritual sacrifices which are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. There is a passage to this effect in scripture, and it runs like this: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes on him will by no means be put to shame'.", "7": "It is you who believe in him that he is \u201cprecious\u201d, but to those who disobey God, it is true that: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone'.", "8-10": "a\u00a0And he is, to them, 'a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence'. b-10\u00a0Yes, they stumble at the Word of God for in their hearts they are unwilling to obey it\u2014which makes stumbling a foregone conclusion. But you are God's \u201cchosen generation\u201d, his \u201croyal priesthood\u201d, his \u201choly nation\u201d, his \u201cpeculiar people\u201d\u2014all the old titles of God's people now belong to you. It is for you now to demonstrate the goodness of him who has called you out of darkness into his amazing light. In the past you were not \u201ca people\u201d at all: now you are the people of God. In the past you had no experience of his mercy, but now it is intimately yours.", "11": "I beg you, as those whom I love, to live in this world as strangers and \u201ctemporary residents\u201d, to keep clear of the desires of your lower natures, for they are always at war with your souls.", "12": "Your conduct among the surrounding peoples in your different countries should always be good and right, so that although they may in the usual way slander you as evil-doers yet when disasters come, they may glorify God when they see how well you conduct yourselves.", "13-17": "Obey every man-made authority for the Lord's sake\u2014whether it is the emperor, as the supreme ruler, or the governors whom he has appointed to punish evil-doers and reward those who do good service. It is the will of God that you may thus silence the ill-informed criticisms of the foolish. As free men you should never use your freedom as an excuse for doing something that is wrong, for you are at all times the servants of God. You should have respect for everyone, you should love our brotherhood, fear God and honour the emperor.", "18-20": "You who are servants should submit to your masters with proper respect\u2014not only to the good and kind, but also to the difficult. A man does something valuable when he endures pain, as in the sight of God, though he knows he is suffering unjustly. After all, it is no credit to you if you are patient in bearing a punishment which you have richly deserved! But if you do your duty and are punished for it and can still accept it patiently, you are doing something worthwhile in God's sight.", "21-25": "Indeed this is part of your calling. For Christ suffered for you and left you a personal example, and wants you to follow in his steps. 'Who committed no sin, nor was guile found in his mouth'. Yet when he was insulted he offered no insult in return. When he suffered he made no threats of revenge. He simply committed his cause to the one who judges fairly. And he personally bore our sins in his own body on the cross, so that we might be dead to sin and be alive to all that is good. It was the suffering that he bore which has healed you. You had wandered away like so many sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls."}

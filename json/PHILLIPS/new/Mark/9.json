{"1": "Then he added, \u201cBelieve me, there are some of you standing here who will know nothing of death until you have seen the kingdom of God coming in its power!\u201d", "2-5": "Six days later, Jesus took Peter and James and John with him and led them high up on a hill-side where they were entirely alone. His whole appearance changed before their eyes, while his clothes became white, dazzling white\u2014whiter than any earthly bleaching could make them. Elijah and Moses appeared to the disciples and stood there in conversation with Jesus. Peter burst out to Jesus, \u201cMaster, it is wonderful for us to be here! Shall we put up three shelters\u2014one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah?\u201d", "6-7": "He really did not know what to say, for they were very frightened. Then came a cloud which overshadowed them and a voice spoke out of the cloud, \u201cThis is my dearly-loved Son. Listen to him!\u201d", "8-11": "Then, quite suddenly they looked all round them and saw nobody at all with them but Jesus. And as they came down the hill-side, he warned them not to tell anybody what they had seen till \u201cthe Son of Man should have risen again from the dead\u201d. They treasured this remark and tried to puzzle out among themselves what \u201cRising from the dead\u201d could mean. Then they asked him this question, \u201cWhy do the scribes say that Elijah must come before Christ?\u201d", "12-13": "\u201cIt is quite true,\u201d he told them, \u201cthat Elijah does come first, and begins the restitution of all things. But what does the scripture say about the Son of Man? This: that he must go through much suffering and be treated with contempt! I tell you that not only has Elijah come already but they have done to him exactly what they wanted\u2014just as the scripture says of him.\u201d", "14-15": "Then as they rejoined the other disciples, they saw that they were surrounded by a large crowd, and that some of the scribes were arguing with them. As soon as the people saw Jesus, they ran forward excitedly to welcome him.", "16": "\u201cWhat is the trouble?\u201d Jesus asked them.", "17-18": "A man from the crowd answered, \u201cMaster, I brought my son to you because he has a dumb spirit. Wherever he is, it gets hold of him, throws him down on the ground and there he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. It's simply wearing him out. I did speak to your disciples to get them to drive it out, but they hadn't the power to do it.\u201d", "19": "Jesus answered them, \u201cOh, what a faithless people you are! How long must I be with you, how long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.\u201d", "20": "So they brought the boy to him, and as soon as the spirit saw Jesus, it convulsed the boy, who fell to the ground and writhed there, foaming at the mouth.", "21": "\u201cHow long has he been like this?\u201d Jesus asked the father.", "22": "\u201cEver since he was a child,\u201d he replied. \u201cAgain and again it has thrown him into the fire or into water to finish him off. But if you can do anything, please take pity on us and help us.\u201d", "23": "\u201cIf you can do anything!\u201d retorted Jesus. \u201cEverything is possible to the man who believes.\u201d", "24": "\u201cI do believe,\u201d the boy's father burst out. \u201cHelp me to believe more!\u201d", "25": "When Jesus noticed that a crowd was rapidly gathering, he spoke sharply to the evil spirit, with the words, \u201cI command you, deaf and dumb spirit, come out of this boy, and never go into him again!\u201d", "26": "The spirit gave a loud scream and after a dreadful convulsion left him. The boy lay there like a corpse, so that most of the bystanders said, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d", "27-28": "But Jesus grasped his hands and lifted him up, and then he stood on his own feet. When he had gone home, Jesus' disciples asked him privately, \u201cWhy were we unable to drive it out?\u201d", "29": "\u201cNothing can drive out this kind of thing except prayer,\u201d replied Jesus.", "30-32": "Then they left that district and went straight through Galilee. Jesus kept this journey secret for he was teaching his disciples that the Son of Man would be betrayed into the power of men, that they would kill him and that three days after his death he would rise again. But they were completely mystified by this saying, and were afraid to question him about it.", "33": "So they came to Capernaum. And when they were indoors he asked them, \u201cWhat were you discussing as we came along?\u201d", "34-35": "They were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about who should be the greatest. Jesus sat down and called the twelve, and said to them, \u201cIf any man wants to be first, he must be last and servant of all.\u201d", "36-37": "Then he took a little child and stood him in front of them all, and putting his arms round him, said to them, \u201cAnyone who welcomes one little child like this for my sake is welcoming me. And the man who welcomes me is welcoming not only me but the one who sent me!\u201d", "38": "Then John said to him, \u201cMaster, we saw somebody driving out evil spirits in your name, and we stopped him, for he is not one who follows us.\u201d", "39-41": "But Jesus replied, \u201cYou must not stop him. No one who exerts such power in my name would readily say anything against me. For the man who is not against us is on our side. In fact, I assure you that the man who gives you a mere drink of water in my name, because you are followers of mine, will most certainly be rewarded.\u201d", "42": "\u201cAnd I tell you too, that the man who disturbs the faith of one of the humblest of those who believe in me would be better off if he were thrown into the sea with a great mill-stone hung round his neck!\u201d", "43-49": "\u201cIndeed, if it is your own hand that spoils your faith, you must cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to keep both your hands and go to the rubbish-heap, If your foot spoils your faith, you must cut it off. It is better to enter life on one foot than to keep both your feet and be thrown on to the rubbish-heap. And if your eye leads you astray, pluck it out. It is better for you to go one-eyed into the kingdom of God than to keep both eyes and be thrown on to the rubbish-heap, where 'their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched'. For everyone will be salted by fire.\u201d", "50": "\u201cSalt is a very good thing; but if it should lose its saltiness, what can you do to restore its flavour? You must have salt in yourselves, and live at peace with each other.\u201d"}

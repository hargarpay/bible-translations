{"1-5": "Then I looked again and before my eyes the Lamb was standing on Mount Sion, and with him were a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written upon their foreheads. Then I heard a sound coming from Heaven like the roar of a great waterfall and the heavy rolling of thunder. Yet the sound which I heard was also like the music of harpists sweeping their strings. And now they are singing a new song of praise before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn that song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth. These are the men who have never defiled themselves with women, for they are celibate. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he may go; these men have been redeemed from among mankind as first-fruits to God and to the Lamb. They have never been guilty of any falsehood; they are beyond reproach.", "6-7": "Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, holding the everlasting Gospel to proclaim to the inhabitants of the earth\u2014to every nation and tribe and language and people. He was crying in a loud voice, \u201cReverence God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come! Worship him who made Heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.\u201d", "8": "Then another, a second angel, followed him crying, \u201cFallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She who made all nations drink the wine of her passionate unfaithfulness!\u201d", "9-11": "Then a third angel followed these two, crying in a loud voice, \u201cIf any man worships the animal and its statue and bears its mark upon his forehead or upon his hand, then that man shall drink the wine of God's passion, poured undiluted into the cup of his wrath. He shall be tortured by fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. The smoke of such men's torture ascends for timeless ages, and there is no respite from it day or night. Such are the worshippers of the animal and its statue and among their number are all who bear the mark of its name.\u201d", "12": "In all this stands the endurance of the saints\u2014those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.", "13": "Then I heard a voice from Heaven, saying, \u201cWrite this! From henceforth happy are the dead who die in the Lord!\u201d \u201cHappy indeed,\u201d says the Spirit, \u201cfor they rest from their labours and their deeds go with them!\u201d", "14": "Once again I looked, and a white cloud appeared before me with someone sitting upon the cloud with the appearance of 'the Son of Man'. He had a golden crown on his head, and held a sharp sickle in his hand.", "15": "Then another angel came out from the Temple, calling in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud, \u201cThrust in your sickle and reap, for the time of reaping has come and the harvest of the earth is fully ripe!\u201d", "16": "Then the one sitting upon the cloud swung his sickle upon the earth, and the reaping of the earth was done.", "17": "Then another angel came out from the Temple in Heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.", "18": "Yet another angel came out from the altar where he had command over the fire, and called out in a loud voice to the angel with the sharp sickle, \u201cThrust in your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters from the vineyard of the earth for the grapes are fully ripe!\u201d", "19-20": "Then the angel swung his sickle upon the earth and gathered the harvest of the earth's vineyard, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. The grapes were trodden outside the city, and out of the winepress flowed blood for two hundred miles in a stream as high as the horses' bridles."}

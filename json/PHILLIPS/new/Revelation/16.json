{"1": "Then I heard a loud voice from the Temple saying to the seven angels, \u201cGo and pour out upon the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God!\u201d", "2": "The first angel went off and emptied his bowl upon the earth. Whereupon loathsome and malignant ulcers attacked all those who bore the mark of the animal and worshipped its statue.", "3": "The second angel emptied his bowl into the sea, which turned into a fluid like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing in it died.", "4-6": "Then the third angel emptied his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they turned into blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say, \u201cYou are righteous, O Lord, the one who is and who was and who is to be, because you have judged these things. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. For it is their just due.\u201d", "7": "And I heard the altar say, \u201cEven so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.\u201d", "8-9": "The fourth angel emptied his bowl over the sun, and the sun was given power to scorch men in its fiery blaze. Then men were terribly burned in the heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has control over these afflictions; but they neither repented nor gave him glory.", "10-11": "Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl upon the throne of the animal. Its kingdom was plunged into darkness; men gnawed their tongues in agony, cursed the God of Heaven for their pain and their ulcers, but refused to repent of what they had done.", "12": "Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl upon the great River Euphrates. The waters of that river were dried up to prepare a road for the kings from the east.", "13-14": "And then I noticed three foul spirits, looking like frogs emerging from the mouths of the dragon, the animal and the false prophet. They are diabolical spirits performing wonders and they set out to muster all the kings of the world for battle on the great day of God, the Almighty.", "15": "\u201cSee, I am coming like a thief! Happy is the man who stays awake and keeps his clothes at his side, so that he will not have to walk naked and men see his shame.\u201d", "16": "So they brought them together to the place called, in Hebrew, Armageddon.", "17": "The seventh angel emptied his bowl into the air. A loud voice came out of the Temple, from the throne, saying, \u201cThe end has come!\u201d", "18-21": "Then followed flashes of lightning, noises and peals of thunder. There was a terrific earthquake, the like of which no man has ever seen since mankind began to live upon the earth\u2014so great and tremendous was this earthquake. The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of all the nations fell in ruins. And God called to mind Babylon the great and made her drink the cup of the wine of his furious wrath. Every island fled and the mountains vanished. Great hailstones like heavy weights fell from the sky and men blasphemed God for the curse of the hail, for it fell upon them with savage and fearful blows."}

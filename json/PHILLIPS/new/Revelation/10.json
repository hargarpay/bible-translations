{"1-4": "Then I saw another mighty angel descending from Heaven. He was clothed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow around his head. His face blazed like the sun, his legs like pillars of fire, and he had a little book lying open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, and then shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted the seven thunders lifted their voices. When the seven thunders had rolled I was on the point of writing but I heard a voice from heaven, saying, \u201cSeal up what the seven thunders said, but do not write it down!\u201d", "5-7": "Then the angel whom I had seen bestriding the sea and the land raised his right hand to Heaven and swore by the living one of the timeless ages, who created Heaven, earth and sea and all that is in them: \u201cThere shall be no more delay! In the days which shall soon be announced by the trumpet-blast of the seventh angel the mysterious purpose of God shall be completed, as he assured his servants the prophets.\u201d", "8": "Then the voice which I had heard from Heaven was again in my ears, saying, \u201cGo, and take the little book which lies open in the hand of the angel whose feet are planted on both sea and land.\u201d", "9": "So I went off towards the angel, asking him to give me the little book. \u201cTake it,\u201d he said to me, \u201cand eat it up. It will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.\u201d", "10": "Then I took the little book from the angel's hand and swallowed it. It was as sweet as honey to the taste but when I had eaten it up it was bitter to my stomach.", "11": "Then they said to me, \u201cIt is again your duty to prophesy about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.\u201d"}

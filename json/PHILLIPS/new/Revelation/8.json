He was given a great quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all the saints, to be laid upon the golden altar before the throne. And the smoke of the incense rose up before God from the angel's hand, mingled with the prayers of the saints. Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it upon the earth. And at that there were thunderings and noises, flashes of lightning and an earthquake. Then the seven angels who were holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.", "7": "The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mingled with blood appeared, and were hurled upon the earth.

A third-part of the sea turned into blood, a third of all live creatures in the sea died, and a third-part of all shipping was destroyed.", "10-11": "Then the third angel blew his trumpet and there fell from the sky a huge star blazing like a torch.

A third of all the waters turned into wormwood, and many people died because the waters had become so bitter.", "12": "The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third-part of the sun, a third-part of the moon and a third of the stars were struck. A third-part of the light of each of them was darkened, so that light by day and light by night were both diminished by a third-part.", "13": "Then in my vision I saw a solitary eagle flying in mid-heaven, crying in a loud voice, \u201cAlas, alas, alas for the inhabitants of the earth for there are three more trumpet blasts which the three angels shall sound!\u201d"}

{"1-2": "Then I noticed in the right hand of the one seated upon the throne a book filled with writing both inside and on its back, and it was sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel who called out in a loud voice, \u201cWho is fit to open the book and break its seals?\u201d", "3-5": "And no one in Heaven or upon the earth or under the earth was able to open the book, or even to look at it. I began to weep bitterly because no one could be found fit to open the book, or even to look at it, when one of the elders said to me, \u201cDo not weep. See, the lion from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has won the victory and is able to open the book and break its seven seals.\u201d", "6-7": "Then, standing in the very centre of the throne and of the four living creatures and of the elders, I saw a Lamb that seemed to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God and are sent out into every corner of the earth. Then he came and took the book from the right hand of him who was seated upon the throne.", "8-10": "When he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp, and they had golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. They sang a new song and these are the words they sang, \u201cYou are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth.\u201d", "11-12": "Then in my vision I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne, the living creatures and the elders. There were myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, crying in a great voice, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honour and glory and blessing!\u201d", "13": "Then I heard the voice of everything created in Heaven, upon earth, under the earth and upon the sea, and all that are in them saying, \u201cBlessing and honour and glory and power be to him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever!\u201d", "14": "The four living creatures said, \u201cAmen\u201d, while the elders fell down and worshipped."}

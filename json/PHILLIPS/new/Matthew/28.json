{"1-7": "When the Sabbath was over, just as the first day of the week was dawning Mary from Magdala and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. At that moment there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from Heaven, went forward and rolled back the stone and took his seat upon it. His appearance was dazzling like lightning and his clothes were white as snow. The guards shook with terror at the sight of him and collapsed like dead men. But the angel spoke to the women, \u201cDo not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here\u2014he is risen, just as he said he would. Come and look at the place where he was lying. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And, listen, he goes before you into Galilee! You will see him there! Now I have told you my message.\u201d", "8": "Then the women went away quickly from the tomb, their hearts filled with awe and great joy, and ran to give the news to his disciples.", "9-10": "But quite suddenly, Jesus stood before them in their path, and said, \u201cPeace be with you!\u201d And they went forward to meet him and, clasping his feet, worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid. Go now and tell my brothers to go into Galilee and they shall see me there\u201d", "11-15": "And while they were on their way, some of the sentries went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. They got together with the elders, and after consultation gave the soldiers a considerable sum of money and told them, \u201cYour story must be that his disciples came after dark, and stole him away while you were asleep. If by any chance this reaches the governor's ears, we will put it right with him and see that you do not suffer for it.\u201d So they took the money and obeyed their instructions. The story was spread and is current among the Jews to this day.", "16-17": "But the eleven went to the hill-side in Galilee where Jesus had arranged to meet them, and when they had seen him they worshipped him, though some of them were doubtful.", "18-20": "But Jesus came and spoke these words to them, \u201cAll power in Heaven and on earth has been given to me. You, then, are to go and make disciples of all the nations and baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you and, remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.\u201d"}

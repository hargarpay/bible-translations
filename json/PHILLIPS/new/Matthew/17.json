{"1-3": "Six days later Jesus chose Peter, James and his brother John, to accompany him high up on the hill-side where they were quite alone. There his whole appearance changed before their eyes, his face shining like the sun and his clothes as white as light. Then Moses and Elijah were seen talking to Jesus.", "4": "\u201cLord,\u201d exclaimed Peter, \u201cit is wonderful for us to be here! If you like I could put up three shelters, one each for you and Moses and Elijah\u2014\u2014\u201d", "5": "But while he was still talking a bright cloud overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud: \u201cThis is my dearly loved Son in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!\u201d", "6-7": "When they heard this voice the disciples fell on their faces, overcome with fear. Then Jesus came up to them and touched them.", "8": "\u201cGet up and don't be frightened,\u201d he said. And as they raised their eyes there was no one to be seen but Jesus himself.", "9-10": "On their way down the hill-side Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. Then the disciples demanded, \u201cWhy is it, then, that the scribes always say Elijah must come first?\u201d", "11-12": "\u201cYes, Elijah does come first,\u201d replied Jesus, \u201cand begins the world's reformation. But I tell you that Elijah has come already and men did not recognise him. They did what they liked with him, and they will do the same to the Son of Man.\u201d", "13": "Then they realised that he had been referring to John the Baptist.", "14-16": "When they returned to the crowds again a man came and knelt in front of Jesus. \u201cLord, do have pity on my son,\u201d he said, \u201cfor he is a lunatic and is in a terrible state. He is always falling into the fire or into the water. I did bring him to your disciples but they couldn't cure him.\u201d", "17": "\u201cYou really are an unbelieving and difficult people,\u201d Jesus returned. \u201cHow long must I be with you, and how long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!\u201d", "18": "Then Jesus reprimanded the evil spirit and it went out of the boy, who was cured from that moment.", "19": "Afterwards the disciples approached Jesus privately and asked, \u201cWhy weren't we able to get rid of it?\u201d", "20-21": "\u201cBecause you have so little faith,\u201d replied Jesus. \u201cI assure you that if you have as much faith as a grain of mustard-seed you can say to this hill, 'Up you get and move over there!' and it will move\u2014you will find nothing is impossible.\u201d \u201cHowever, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting\u201d", "22-23": "As they went about together in Galilee, Jesus told them, \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be handed over to the power of men, and they will kill him. And on the third day he will be raised to life again.\u201d This greatly distressed the disciples.", "24": "Then when they arrived at Capernaum the Temple tax-collectors came up and said to Peter, \u201cYour master doesn't pay Temple-tax, we presume?\u201d", "25": "\u201cOh, yes, he does!\u201d replied Peter. Later when he went into the house Jesus anticipated what he was going to say. \u201cWhat do you think, Simon?\u201d he said. \u201cWhom do the kings of this world get their rates and taxes from\u2014their own people or from others?\u201d", "26": "\u201cFrom others,\u201d replied Peter.", "27": "\u201cThen the family is exempt,\u201d Jesus told him. \u201cYet we don't want to give offence to these people, so go down to the lake and throw in your hook. Take the first fish that bites, open his mouth and you'll find a coin. Take that and give it to them, for both of us.\u201d"}

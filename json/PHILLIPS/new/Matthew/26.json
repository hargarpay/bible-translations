{"1-2": "When Jesus had finished all this teaching he spoke to his disciples, \u201cDo you realise that the Passover will begin in two days' time; and the Son of Man is going to be betrayed and crucified?\u201d", "3-5": "At that very time the chief priests and elders of the people had assembled in the court of Caiaphas, the High Priest, and were discussing together how they might get hold of Jesus by some trick and kill him. But they kept saying, \u201cIt must not be during the festival or there might be a riot.\u201d", "6-13": "Back in Bethany, while Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster flask of most expensive perfume, and poured it on his head as he was at table. The disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, \u201cWhat is the point of such wicked waste? Couldn't this perfume have been sold for a lot of money which could be given to the poor?\u201d Jesus knew what they were saying and spoke to them, \u201cWhy must you make this woman feel uncomfortable? She has done a beautiful thing for me. You have the poor with you always, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she was preparing it for burial. I assure you that wherever the Gospel is preached throughout the whole world, this deed of hers will also be recounted, as her memorial to me.\u201d", "14-16": "After this, one of the twelve, Judas Iscariot by name, approached the chief priests. \u201cWhat will you give me,\u201d he said to them, \u201cif I hand him over to you?\u201d They settled with him for thirty silver coins, and from then on he looked for a convenient opportunity to betray Jesus.", "17": "On the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus with the question, \u201cWhere do you want us to make our preparations for you to eat the Passover?\u201d", "18-25": "\u201cGo into the city,\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cto a certain man there and say to him, 'The Master says, \u201cMy time is near. I am going to keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.\u201d'\u201d The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover. Then late in the evening he took his place at table with the twelve and during the meal he said, \u201cI tell you plainly that one of you is going to betray me.\u201d They were deeply distressed at this and each began to say to him in turn, \u201cSurely, Lord, I am not the one?\u201d And his answer was, \u201cThe man who has dipped his hand into the dish with me is the man who will betray me. It is true that the Son of Man will follow the road foretold by the scriptures, but alas for the man through whom he is betrayed! It would be better for that man if had never been born.\u201d And Judas, who actually betrayed him, said, \u201cMaster, am I the one?\u201d \u201cAs you say!\u201d replied Jesus.", "26-29": "In the middle of the meal Jesus took a loaf and after blessing it he broke it into pieces and gave it to the disciples. \u201cTake and eat this,\u201d he said, \u201cit is my body.\u201d Then he took a cup and after thanking God, he gave it to them with the words, \u201cDrink this, all of you, for it is my blood, the blood of the new agreement shed to set many free from their sins. I tell you I will drink no more wine until I drink it fresh with you in my Father's kingdom.\u201d", "30-31": "Then they sang a hymn together and went out to the Mount of Olives. There Jesus said to them, \u201cTonight every one of you will lose his faith in me. For the scripture says, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered'.", "32": "But after I have risen I shall go before you into Galilee!\u201d", "33": "At this Peter exclaimed, \u201cEven if everyone should lose his faith in you, I never will!\u201d", "34": "\u201cI tell you, Peter,\u201d replied Jesus, \u201cthat tonight, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.\u201d", "35": "\u201cEven if it means dying with you I will never disown you,\u201d said Peter. And all the disciples made the same protest.", "36-39": "Then Jesus came with the disciples to a place called Gethsemane and said to them, \u201cSit down here while I go over there and pray.\u201d Then he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be in terrible distress and misery. \u201cMy heart is nearly breaking,\u201d he told them, \u201cstay here and keep watch with me.\u201d Then he walked on a little way and fell on his face and prayed, \u201cMy Father, if it is possible let this cup pass from me\u2014yet it must not be what I want, but what you want.\u201d", "40-46": "Then he came back to the disciples and found them fast asleep. He spoke to Peter, \u201cCouldn't you three keep awake with me for a single hour? Watch and pray, all of you, that you may not have to face temptation. Your spirit is willing, but human nature is weak.\u201d Then he went away a second time and prayed, \u201cMy Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me without my drinking it, then your will must be done.\u201d And he came and found them asleep again, for they could not keep their eyes open. So he left them and went away again and prayed for the third time using the same words as before. Then he came back to his disciples and spoke to them, \u201cAre you still going to sleep and take your ease? In a moment you will see the Son of Man betrayed into the hands of evil men. Wake up, let us be going! Look, here comes my betrayer!\u201d", "47-48": "And while the words were still on his lips, Judas, one of the twelve appeared with a great crowd armed with swords and staves, sent by the chief priests and Jewish elders. (The traitor himself had given them a sign, \u201cThe one I kiss will be the man. Get him!\u201d)", "49-50": "Without any hesitation he walked up to Jesus. \u201cGreetings, Master!\u201d he cried and kissed him affectionately. \u201cJudas, my friend,\u201d replied Jesus, \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d Then the others came up, seized hold of Jesus and held him.", "51-54": "Suddenly one of Jesus' disciples drew his sword, slashed at the High Priest's servant and cut off his ear. At this Jesus said to him, \u201cPut your sword back into its proper place. All those who take the sword die by the sword. Do you imagine that I could not appeal to my Father, and he would at once send more than twelve legions of angels to defend me? But then, how would the scriptures be fulfilled which say that all this must take place?\u201d", "55-56": "And then Jesus spoke to the crowds around him: \u201cSo you've come out with your swords and staves to capture me like a bandit, have you? Day after day I sat teaching in the Temple and you never laid a finger on me. But all this is happening as the prophets said it would.\u201d And at this point all the disciples deserted him and made their escape.", "57-58": "The men who had seized Jesus took him off to Caiaphas the High Priest in whose house the scribes and elders were assembled. Peter followed him at a safe distance right up to the High Priest's courtyard. Then he went inside and sat down with the servants and waited to see the end.", "59-61": "Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole council did all they could to find false evidence against Jesus to get him condemned to death. They failed completely. Even after a number of perjurers came forward they still failed. In the end two of these stood up and said, \u201cThis man said, 'I can pull down the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\u201d", "62-64": "Then the High Priest rose to his feet and addressed Jesus, \u201cHave you no answer? What about the evidence of these men against you?\u201d But Jesus was silent. Then the High Priest said to him, \u201cI command you by the living God, to tell us on your oath if you are Christ, the Son of God.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cI am. Yes, and I tell you that in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of Heaven.\u201d", "65-66": "At this the High Priest tore his robes and cried, \u201cThat was blasphemy! Where is the need for further witnesses? Look, you've heard the blasphemy\u2014what's your verdict now?\u201d And they replied, \u201che deserves to die.\u201d", "67-68": "Then they spat in his face and knocked him about, and some slapped him, crying, \u201cProphesy, you Christ, who was that who hit you?\u201d", "69-75": "All this time Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a maidservant came up to him and said, \u201cWeren't you with Jesus, the man from Galilee?\u201d But he denied it before them all, saying \u201cI don't know what you're talking about.\u201d Then when he had gone out into the porch, another maid caught sight of him and said to those who were there, \u201cThis man was with Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d And again he denied it with an oath\u2014\u201cI don't know the man\u201d! A few minutes later those who were standing about came up to Peter and said to him, \u201cYou certainly are one of them, you know; it's obvious from your accent.\u201d At that he began to curse and swear\u2014\u201cI tell you I don't know the man!\u201d Immediately the cock crew, and the words of Jesus came back into Peter's mind\u2014\u201cBefore the cock crows you will disown me three times.\u201d And he went outside and wept bitterly."}

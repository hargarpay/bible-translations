{"1": "When Jesus had finished giving his twelve disciples these instructions he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns in which they lived.", "2-3": "John the Baptist was in prison when he heard what Christ was doing, and he sent a message through his own disciples asking the question, \u201cAre you the one who was to come or are we to look for somebody else?\u201d", "4-6": "Jesus gave them this reply, \u201cGo and tell John what you see and her\u2014that blind men are recovering their sight, cripples are walking, lepers being healed, the deaf hearing, the dead being brought to life and the good news is being given to those in need. And happy is the man who never loses faith in me.\u201d", "7-10": "As John's disciples were going away Jesus began talking to the crowd about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the desert to look at? A reed waving in the breeze? No? Then what was it you went out to see?\u2014a man dressed in fine clothes? But the men who wear fine clothes live in the courts of kings! But what did you really go to see\u2014a prophet? Yes, I tell you, a prophet and far more than a prophet! This is the man of whom the scripture says\u2014'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you'.", "11": "\u201cBelieve me, no one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born of all mankind, and yet a humble member of the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.", "12-15": "\u201cFrom the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of Heaven has been taken by storm and eager men are forcing their way into it. For the Law and all the prophets foretold it till the time of John and\u2014if you can believe it\u2014John himself is the 'Elijah' who must come before the kingdom. The man who has ears to hear must use them.", "16-19": "\u201cBut how can I show what the people of this generation are like? They are like children sitting in the market-place calling out to their friends, 'We played at weddings for you but you wouldn't dance, and we played at funerals and you wouldn't cry!' For John came in the strictest austerity and people say, 'He's crazy!' Then the Son of Man came, enjoying life, and people say, 'Look, a drunkard and a glutton\u2014the bosom-friend of the tax-collector and the sinner.' Ah, well, wisdom stands or falls by her own actions.\u201d", "20": "Then Jesus began reproaching the towns where most of his miracles had taken place because their hearts were unchanged.", "21-22": "\u201cAlas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if Tyre and Sidon had seen the demonstrations of God's power which you have seen they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Yet I tell you this, that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.", "23-24": "\u201cAnd as for you, Capernaum, are you on your way up to Heaven? I tell you will go hurtling down among the dead! If Sodom had seen the miracles that you have seen, Sodom would be standing today. Yet I tell you now that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.\u201d", "25-26": "At this same time Jesus said, \u201cO Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, I thank you for hiding these things from the clever and intelligent and for showing them to mere children. Yes, I thank you, Father, that this was your will.\u201d", "27": "Then he said: \u201cEverything has been put in my hands by my Father, and nobody knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son\u2014and the man to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.", "28-30": "\u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and over-burdened, and I will give you rest! Put on my yoke and learn from me. For I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u201d"}

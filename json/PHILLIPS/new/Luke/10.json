{"1": "Later on the Lord commissioned seventy other disciples and sent them off in twos as advance-parties into every town and district where he intended to go.", "2": "\u201cThere is a great harvest,\u201d he told them, \u201cbut only a few are working in it\u2014which means you must pray to the Lord of the harvest that he will send out more reapers.", "3-7": "\u201cNow go on your way. I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Don't carry a purse or a pair of shoes, and don't stop to pass the time of day with anyone you meet on the road. When you go into a house, say first of all, 'Peace be to this household!' If there is a lover of peace there, he will accept your words of blessing, and if not, they will come back to you. Stay in the same house and eat and drink whatever they put before you\u2014a workman deserves his wages. But don't move from one house to another.", "8-12": "Whatever town you go into and the people welcome you, eat the meals they give you and heal the people who are ill there. Tell them, 'The kingdom of God is very near to you now.' But whenever you come into a town and they will not welcome you, you must go into the streets and say, 'We brush off even the dust of your town from our feet as a protest against you. But it is still true that the kingdom of God has arrived! I assure you that it will be better for Sodom in 'that day' than for that town.", "13-15": "Alas for you, Chorazin, and alas for you, Bethsaida! For if Tyre and Sidon had seen the demonstrations of God's power that you have seen, they would have repented long ago and sat in sackcloth and ashes. It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you! As for you, Capernaum, are you on your way up to heaven? I tell you, you will go hurtling down among the dead!\u201d", "16": "Then he added to the seventy, \u201cWhoever listens to you is listening to me, and the man who has no use for you has no use for me either. And the man who has no use for me has no use for the one who sent me!\u201d", "17": "Later the seventy came back full of joy. \u201cLord,\u201d they said, \u201ceven evil spirits obey us when we use your name!\u201d", "18-20": "\u201cYes,\u201d returned Jesus, \u201cI was watching and saw Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning! It is true that I have given you the power to tread on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the enemy's power\u2014there is nothing at all that can do you any harm. Yet it is not your power over evil spirits which should give such joy, but the fact that your names are written in Heaven.\u201d", "21-22": "At that moment Jesus himself was inspired with joy, and exclaimed, \u201cO Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, I thank you for hiding these things from the clever and the intelligent and for showing them to mere children! Yes, I thank you, Father, that this was your will.\u201d Then he went on, \u201cEverything has been put in my hands by my Father; and nobody knows who the Son really is except the Father. Nobody knows who the Father really is except the Son\u2014and the man to whom the Son chooses to reveal him!\u201d", "23-24": "Then he turned to his disciples and said to them quietly, \u201cHow fortunate you are to see what you are seeing! I tell you that many prophets and kings have wanted to see what you are seeing but they never saw it, and to hear what you are hearing but they never heard it.\u201d", "25": "Then one of the experts in the Law stood up to test him and said, \u201cMaster, what must I do to be sure of eternal life?\u201d", "26": "\u201cWhat does the Law say and what has your reading taught you?\u201d said Jesus.", "27": "\u201cThe Law says, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind', and 'your neighbour as yourself',\u201d he replied.", "28": "\u201cQuite right,\u201d said Jesus. \u201cDo that and you will live.\u201d", "29": "But the man, wanting to justify himself, continued, \u201cBut who is my 'neighbour'?\u201d", "30-36": "And Jesus gave him the following reply: \u201cA man was once on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell into the hands of bandits who stripped off his clothes, beat him up, and left him half dead. It so happened that a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. A Levite also came on the scene and when he saw him, he too passed by on the other side. But then a Samaritan traveller came along to the place where the man was lying, and at the sight of him he was touched with pity. He went across to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own mule, brought him to an inn and did what he could for him. Next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the inn-keeper with the words, 'Look after him, will you? I will pay you back whatever more you spend, when I come through here on my return.' Which of these three seems to you to have been a neighbour to the bandits' victim?\u201d", "37": "\u201cThe man who gave him practical sympathy,\u201d he replied. \u201cThen you go and give the same,\u201d returned Jesus.", "38-40": "As they continued their journey, Jesus came to a village and a woman called Martha welcomed him to her house. She had a sister by the name of Mary who settled down at the Lord's feet and was listening to what he said. But Martha was very worried about her elaborate preparations and she burst in, saying, \u201cLord, don't you mind that my sister has left me to do everything by myself? Tell her to get up and help me!\u201d", "41-42": "But the Lord answered her, \u201cMartha, my dear, you are worried and bothered about providing so many things. Only a few things are really needed, perhaps only one. Mary has chosen the best part and you must not tear it away from her!\u201d"}

{"1": "Later, as Jesus walked along he saw a man who had been blind from birth.", "2": "\u201cMaster, whose sin caused this man's blindness,\u201d asked the disciples, \u201chis own or his parents'?\u201d", "3-5": "\u201cHe was not born blind because of his own sin or that of his parents,\u201d returned Jesus, \u201cbut to show the power of God at work in him. We must carry on the work of him who sent me while the daylight lasts. Night is coming, when no one can work. I am the world's light as long as I am in it.\u201d", "6-7": "Having said this, he spat on the ground and made a sort of clay with the saliva. This he applied to the man's eyes and said, \u201cGo and wash in the pool of Siloam.\u201d (Siloam means \u201cone who has been sent\u201d.) So the man went off and washed and came home with his sight restored.", "8": "His neighbours and the people who had often seen him before as a beggar remarked, \u201cIsn't this the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d", "9": "\u201cYes, that's the one,\u201d said some. Others said, \u201cNo, but he's very like him.\u201d But he himself said, \u201cI'm the man all right!\u201d", "10": "\u201cThen how was your blindness cured?\u201d they asked.", "11": "\u201cThe man called Jesus made some clay and smeared it on my eyes,\u201d he replied, \u201cand then he said, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So off I went and washed\u2014and that's how I got my sight!\u201d", "12": "\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d they asked. \u201cI don't know,\u201d he returned.", "13-15": "So they brought the man who had once been blind before the Pharisees. (It should be noted that Jesus made the clay and restored his sight on a Sabbath day.) The Pharisees asked the question all over again as to how he had become able to see. \u201cHe put clay on my eyes; I washed it off; now I can see\u2014that's all,\u201d he replied.", "16-17": "Some of the Pharisees commented, \u201cThis man cannot be from God since he does not observe the Sabbath.\u201d \u201cBut how can a sinner give such wonderful signs as these?\u201d others demurred. And they were in two minds about him. Finally, they asked the blind man again, \u201cAnd what do you say about him? You're the one whose sight was restored.\u201d \u201cI believe he is a prophet,\u201d he replied.", "18-19": "The Jews did not really believe that the man had been blind and then had become able to see, until they had summoned his parents and asked them, \u201cIs this your son who you say was born blind? How does it happen that he can now see?\u201d", "20-21": "\u201cWe know that this is our son, and we know that he was born blind,\u201d returned his parents, \u201cbut how he can see now, or who made him able to see, we have no idea. Why don't you ask him? He is a grown-up man; he can speak for himself.\u201d", "22-23": "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews who had already agreed that anybody who admitted that Christ had done this thing should be excommunicated. It was this fear which made his parents say, \u201cAsk him, he is a grown-up man.\u201d", "24": "So, once again they summoned the man who had been born blind and said to him, \u201cYou should 'give God the glory' for what has happened to you. We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d", "25": "\u201cWhether he is a sinner or not, I couldn't tell, but one thing I am sure of,\u201d the man replied, \u201cI used to be blind, now I can see!\u201d", "26": "\u201cBut what did he do to you\u2014how did he make you see?\u201d they continued.", "27": "\u201cI've told you before,\u201d he replied. \u201cWeren't you listening? Why do you want to hear it all over again? Are you wanting to be his disciples too?\u201d", "28-29": "At this, they turned on him furiously. \u201cYou're the one who is his disciple! We are disciples of Moses. We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we don't even know where he came from.\u201d", "30-33": "\u201cNow here's the extraordinary thing,\u201d he retorted, \u201cyou don't know where he came from and yet he gave me the gift of sight. Everybody knows that God does not listen to sinners. It is the man who has a proper respect for God and does what God wants him to do\u2014he's the one God listens to. Why, since the world began, nobody's ever heard of a man who was born blind being given his sight. If this man did not come from God, he couldn't do such a thing!\u201d", "34": "\u201cYou misbegotten wretch!\u201d they flung back at him. \u201cAre you trying to teach us?\u201d And they threw him out.", "35": "Jesus heard that they had expelled him and when he had found him, he said, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d", "36": "\u201cAnd who is he, sir?\u201d the man replied. \u201cTell me, so that I can believe in him.\u201d", "37": "\u201cYou have seen him,\u201d replied Jesus. \u201cIt is the one who is talking to you now.\u201d", "38": "\u201cLord, I do believe,\u201d he said, and worshipped him.", "39": "Then Jesus said, \u201cMy coming into this world is itself a judgment\u2014those who cannot see have their eyes opened and those who think they can see become blind.\u201d", "40": "Some of the Pharisees near him overheard this and said, \u201cSo we're blind, too, are we?\u201d", "41": "\u201cIf you were blind,\u201d returned Jesus, \u201cnobody could blame you, but, as you insist 'We can see', your guilt remains.\u201d"}

{"1-2": "When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the Cedron valley to a place where there was a garden, and they went into it together. Judas who betrayed him knew the place, for Jesus often met his disciples there.", "3-4": "So Judas fetched the guard and the officers which the chief priests and Pharisees had provided for him, and came to the place with torches and lanterns and weapons. Jesus, fully realising all that was going to happen to him, went forward and said to them, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d", "5": "\u201cJesus of Nazareth,\u201d they answered. \u201cI am the man,\u201d said Jesus. (Judas who was betraying him was standing there with the others.)", "6-7": "When he said to them, \u201cI am the man\u201d, they retreated and fell to the ground. So Jesus asked them again, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d And again they said, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d", "8-9": "\u201cI have told you that I am the man,\u201d replied Jesus. \u201cIf I am the man you are looking for, let these others go.\u201d (Thus fulfilling his previous words, \u201cI have not lost one of those whom you gave me.\u201d)", "10-11": "At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and slashed at the High Priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) But Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given me?\u201d", "12-17": "Then the guard, with their captain and the Jewish officers, took hold of Jesus and tied his hands together, and led him off to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year. Caiaphas was the man who advised the Jews, \u201cthat it would be a good thing that one man should die for the sake of the people.\u201d Behind Jesus followed Simon Peter, and one other disciple who was known personally to the High Priest. He went in with Jesus into the High Priest's courtyard, but Peter was left standing at the door outside. So this other disciple, who was acquainted with the High Priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter inside. The young woman at the door remarked to Peter, \u201cAre you one of this man's disciples, too?\u201d \u201cNo, I am not,\u201d retorted Peter.", "18": "In the courtyard, the servants and officers stood around a charcoal fire which they had made, for it was cold. They were warming themselves, and Peter stood there with them, keeping himself warm.", "19": "Meanwhile the High Priest interrogated Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching.", "20-21": "\u201cI have always spoken quite openly to the world,\u201d replied Jesus. \u201cI have always taught in the synagogue or in the Temple where all the Jews meet together, and I have said nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Why not question those who have heard me about what I said to them? Obviously they are the ones who know what I actually said.\u201d", "22": "As he said this, one of those present, an officer, slapped Jesus with his open hand, remarking, \u201cIs that the way for you to answer the High Priest?\u201d", "23": "\u201cIf I have said anything wrong,\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cyou must give evidence about it, but if what I said was true, why do you strike me?", "24": "Then Annas sent him, with his hands still tied, to the High Priest Caiaphas.", "25": "In the meantime Simon Peter was still standing, keeping himself warm. Some of them said to him, \u201cSurely you too are one of his disciples, aren't you?\u201d And he denied it and said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d", "26": "Then one of the High Priest's servants, a relation of the man (Malchus) whose ear Peter had cut off, remarked, \u201cDidn't I see you in the garden with him?\u201d", "27": "And again Peter denied it. And immediately the cock crew.", "28": "Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas' presence into the palace. It was now early morning and the Jews themselves did not go into the palace, for fear that they would be contaminated and would not be able to eat the Passover.", "29": "So Pilate walked out to them and said, \u201cWhat is the charge that you are bringing against this man?\u201d", "30": "\u201cIf he were not an evil-doer, we should not have handed him over to you,\u201d they replied.", "31-32": "To which Pilate retorted, \u201cThen take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.\u201d \u201cWe are not allowed to put a man to death,\u201d replied the Jews (thus fulfilling Christ's prophecy of the method of his own death).", "33": "So Pilate went back into the Palace and called Jesus to him. \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d he asked.", "34": "\u201cAre you asking this of your own accord,\u201d replied Jesus, \u201cor have other people spoken to you about me?\u201d", "35": "\u201cDo you think I am a Jew?\u201d replied Pilate. \u201cIt's your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What have you done, anyway?\u201d", "36": "\u201cMy kingdom is not founded in this world\u2014if it were, my servants would have fought to prevent my being handed over to the Jews. But in fact my kingdom is not founded on all this!\u201d", "37": "\u201cSo you are a king, are you?\u201d returned Pilate. \u201cIndeed I am a king,\u201d Jesus replied; \u201cthe reason for my birth and the reason for my coming into the world is to witness to the truth. Every man who loves truth recognises my voice.\u201d", "38-39": "To which Pilate retorted, \u201cWhat is 'truth'?\u201d and went straight out again to the Jews and said: \u201cI find nothing criminal about him at all. But I have an arrangement with you to set one prisoner free at Passover time. Do you wish me then to set free for you the 'king of the Jews'?\u201d", "40": "At this, they shouted out again, \u201cNo, not this man, but Barabbas!\u201d Barabbas was a bandit."}

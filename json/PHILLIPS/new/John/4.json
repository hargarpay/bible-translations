{"1-7": "Now when the Lord found that the Pharisees had heard that \u201cJesus is making and baptising more disciples than John\u201d\u2014although, in fact, it was not Jesus who did the baptising but his disciples\u2014he left Judea and went off again to Galilee, which meant passing through Samaria. There he came to a little town called Sychar, which is near the historic plot of land that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph, and \u201cJacob's Spring\u201d was there. Jesus, tired with his journey, sat down beside it, just as he was. The time was about midday. Presently, a Samaritan woman arrived to draw some water.", "8-9": "\u201cPlease give me a drink,\u201d Jesus said to her, for his disciples had gone away to the town to buy food. The Samaritan woman said to him, \u201cHow can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?\u201d (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)", "10": "\u201cIf you knew what God can give,\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cand if you knew who it is that said to you, 'Give me a drink', I think you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water!\u201d", "11-12": "\u201cSir,\u201d said the woman, \u201cyou have nothing to draw water with and this well is deep\u2014where can you get your living water? Are you a greater man than our ancestor, Jacob, who gave us this well, and drank here himself with his family, and his cattle?\u201d", "13-14": "Jesus said to her, \u201cEveryone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. But whoever drinks the water I will give him will never be thirsty again. For my gift will become a spring in the man himself, welling up into eternal life.\u201d", "15": "The woman said, \u201cSir, give me this water, so that I may stop being thirsty\u2014and not have to come here to draw water any more!\u201d", "16": "\u201cGo and call your husband and then come back here,\u201d said Jesus to her.", "17-18": "\u201cI haven't got a husband!\u201d the woman answered. \u201cYou are quite right in saying, 'I haven't got a husband',\u201d replied Jesus, \u201cfor you have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband at all. Yes, you spoke the simple truth when you said that.\u201d", "19-20": "\u201cSir,\u201d said the woman again, \u201cI can see that you are a prophet! Now our ancestors worshipped on this hill-side, but you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship\u2014\u201d", "21-24": "\u201cBelieve me,\u201d returned Jesus, \u201cthe time is coming when worshipping the Father will not be a matter of 'on this hill-side' or 'in Jerusalem'. Nowadays you are worshipping with your eyes shut. We Jews are worshipping with our eyes open, for the salvation of mankind is to come from our race. Yet the time is coming, yes, and has already come, when true worshippers will worship in spirit and in reality. Indeed, the Father looks for men who will worship him like that. God is spirit, and those who worship him can only worship in spirit and in reality.\u201d", "25": "\u201cOf course I know that Messiah is coming,\u201d returned the woman, \u201cyou know, the one who is called Christ. When he comes he will make everything plain to us.\u201d", "26": "\u201cI am Christ speaking to you now,\u201d said Jesus.", "27-30": "At this point his disciples arrived, and were surprised to find him talking to a woman, but none of them asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d or \u201cWhat are you talking to her about?\u201d So the woman left her water-pot behind and went into the town and began to say to the people, \u201cCome out and see the man who told me everything I've ever done! Can this be 'Christ'?\u201d So they left the town and started to come to Jesus.", "31": "Meanwhile the disciples were begging him, \u201cMaster, do eat something.\u201d", "32": "To which Jesus replied, \u201cI have food to eat that you know nothing about.\u201d", "33": "This, of course, made the disciples ask each other, \u201cDo you think anyone has brought him any food?\u201d", "34-38": "Jesus said to them, \u201cMy food is doing the will of him who sent me and finishing the work he has given me. Don't you say, 'Four months more and then comes the harvest'? But I tell you to open your eyes and look to the field\u2014they are gleaming white, all ready for the harvest! The reaper is already being rewarded and getting in a harvest for eternal life, so that both sower and reaper may be glad together. For in this harvest the old saying comes true, 'One man sows and another reaps.' I have sent you to reap a harvest for which you never laboured; other men have worked hard and you have reaped the results of their labours.\u201d", "39-42": "Many of the Samaritans who came out of that town believed in him through the woman's testimony\u2014\u201cHe told me everything I've ever done.\u201d And when they arrived they begged him to stay with them. He did stay there two days and far more believed in him because of what he himself said. As they told the woman, \u201cWe don't believe any longer now because of what you said. We have heard him with our own ears. We know now that this must be the man who will save the world!\u201d", "43-47": "After the two days were over, Jesus left and went away to Galilee. (For Jesus himself testified that a prophet enjoys no honour in his own country.) And on his arrival the people received him with open arms. For they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the festival, since they had themselves been present. So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, the place where he had made the water into wine. At Capernaum there was an official whose son was very ill. When he heard that Jesus had left Judea and had arrived in Galilee, he went off to see him and begged him to come down and heal his son, who was by this time at the point of death.", "48": "Jesus said to him, \u201cI suppose you will never believe unless you see signs and wonders!\u201d", "49": "\u201cSir,\u201d returned the official, \u201cplease come down before my boy dies!\u201d", "50": "\u201cYou can go home,\u201d returned Jesus, \u201cyour son is alive and well.\u201d And the man believed what Jesus had said to him and went on his way.", "51-54": "On the journey back his servants met him with the report, \u201cYour son is alive and well.\u201d So he asked them at what time he had begun to recover, and they replied: \u201cThe fever left him yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon\u201d. Then the father knew that this must have happened at the very moment when Jesus had said to him, \u201cYour son is alive and well.\u201d And he and his whole household believed in Jesus. This, then, was the second sign that Jesus gave on his return from Judea to Galilee."}

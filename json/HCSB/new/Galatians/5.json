I, Paul, tell you that if you get yourselves circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all. ", "3": "Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law. ", "4": "You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace. ", "5": "For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. ", "6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.", "7": "You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth? ", "8": "This persuasion did not come from the One who called you. ", "9": "A little yeast leavens the whole lump of dough.

Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.", "4": "\u201cAll the Jews know my way of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem. ", "5": "They had previously known me for quite some time, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.

King Agrippa, I am being accused by the Jews because of this hope. ", "8": "Why is it considered incredible by any of you that God raises the dead? ", "9": "In fact, I myself supposed it was necessary to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Nazarene. ", "10": "I actually did this in Jerusalem, and I locked up many of the saints in prison, since I had received authority for that from the chief priests. When they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. ", "11": "In all the synagogues I often tried to make them blaspheme by punishing them.

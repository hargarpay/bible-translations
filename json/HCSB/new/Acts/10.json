{"1": "There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment. ", "2": "He was a devout man and feared God along with his whole household. He did many charitable deeds for the Jewish people and always prayed to God. ", "3": "About three in the afternoon[a] he distinctly saw in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him, \u201cCornelius!\u201d", "4": "Looking intently at him, he became afraid and said, \u201cWhat is it, lord?\u201d The angel told him, \u201cYour prayers and your acts of charity have come up as a memorial offering before God. ", "5": "Now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, who is also named Peter. ", "6": "He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.\u201d", "7": "When the angel who spoke to him had gone, he called two of his household slaves and a devout soldier, who was one of those who attended him. ", "8": "After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.", "9": "The next day, as they were traveling and nearing the city, Peter went up to pray on the housetop about noon.[b] ", "10": "Then he became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing something, he went into a visionary state. ", "11": "He saw heaven opened and an object that resembled a large sheet coming down, being lowered by its four corners to the earth. ", "12": "In it were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth, and the birds of the sky. ", "13": "Then a voice said to him, \u201cGet up, Peter; kill and eat!\u201d", "14": "\u201cNo, Lord!\u201d Peter said. \u201cFor I have never eaten anything common[c] and ritually unclean!\u201d", "15": "Again, a second time, a voice said to him, \u201cWhat God has made clean, you must not call common.\u201d ", "16": "This happened three times, and then the object was taken up into heaven.", "17": "While Peter was deeply perplexed about what the vision he had seen might mean, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions to Simon's house, stood at the gate. ", "18": "They called out, asking if Simon, who was also named Peter, was lodging there.", "19": "While Peter was thinking about the vision, the Spirit told him, \u201cThree men are here looking for you. ", "20": "Get up, go downstairs, and accompany them with no doubts at all, because I have sent them.\u201d", "21": "Then Peter went down to the men and said, \u201cHere I am, the one you're looking for. What is the reason you're here?\u201d", "22": "They said, \u201cCornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who has a good reputation with the whole Jewish nation, was divinely directed by a holy angel to call you to his house and to hear a message from you.\u201d ", "23": "Peter then invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he got up and set out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him. ", "24": "The following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. ", "25": "When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.", "26": "But Peter helped him up and said, \u201cStand up! I myself am also a man.\u201d ", "27": "While talking with him, he went on in and found that many had come together there. ", "28": "Peter said to them, \u201cYou know it's forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a foreigner. But God has shown me that I must not call any person common or unclean. ", "29": "That's why I came without any objection when I was sent for. So I ask: Why did you send for me?\u201d", "30": "Cornelius replied, \u201cFour days ago at this hour, at three in the afternoon,[d] I was[e] praying in my house. Just then a man in a dazzling robe stood before me ", "31": "and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered in God's sight. ", "32": "Therefore send someone to Joppa and invite Simon here, who is also named Peter. He is lodging in Simon the tanner's house by the sea.'[f] ", "33": "Therefore I immediately sent for you, and you did the right thing in coming. So we are all present before God, to hear everything you have been commanded by the Lord.\u201d", "34": "Then Peter began to speak: \u201cNow I really understand that God doesn't show favoritism, ", "35": "but in every nation the person who fears Him and does righteousness is acceptable to Him. ", "36": "He sent the message to the Israelites, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ\u2014He is Lord of all. ", "37": "You know the events[g] that took place throughout Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John preached: ", "38": "how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were under the tyranny of the Devil, because God was with Him. ", "39": "We ourselves are witnesses of everything He did in both the Judean country and in Jerusalem, yet they killed Him by hanging Him on a tree. ", "40": "God raised up this man on the third day and permitted Him to be seen, ", "41": "not by all the people, but by us, witnesses appointed beforehand by God, who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead. ", "42": "He commanded us to preach to the people and to solemnly testify that He is the One appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead. ", "43": "All the prophets testify about Him that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.\u201d", "44": "While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came down on all those who heard the message. ", "45": "The circumcised believers[h] who had come with Peter were astounded because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. ", "46": "For they heard them speaking in other languages and declaring the greatness of[i] God. Then Peter responded, ", "47": "\u201cCan anyone withhold water and prevent these people from being baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?\u201d ", "48": "And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days."}

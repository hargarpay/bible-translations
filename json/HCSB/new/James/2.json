{"1": "My brothers, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. ", "2": "For example, a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor man dressed in dirty clothes also comes in. ", "3": "If you look with favor on the man wearing the fine clothes and say, \u201cSit here in a good place,\u201d and yet you say to the poor man, \u201cStand over there,\u201d or, \u201cSit here on the floor by my footstool,\u201d ", "4": "haven't you discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?", "5": "Listen, my dear brothers: Didn't God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him? ", "6": "Yet you dishonored that poor man. Don't the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? ", "7": "Don't they blaspheme the noble name that was pronounced over you at your baptism?", "8": "Indeed, if you keep the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, Love your neighbor as yourself,[a] you are doing well. ", "9": "But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. ", "10": "For whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is guilty of breaking it all. ", "11": "For He who said, Do not commit adultery,[b] also said, Do not murder.[c] So if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you are a lawbreaker.", "12": "Speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of freedom. ", "13": "For judgment is without mercy to the one who hasn't shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.", "14": "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can his faith[d] save him?", "15": "If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food ", "16": "and one of you says to them, \u201cGo in peace, keep warm, and eat well,\u201d but you don't give them what the body needs, what good is it? ", "17": "In the same way faith, if it doesn't have works, is dead by itself.", "18": "But someone will say, \u201cYou have faith, and I have works.\u201d[e] Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith from my works.[f] ", "19": "You believe that God is one; you do well. The demons also believe\u2014and they shudder.", "20": "Foolish man! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless? ", "21": "Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? ", "22": "You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was perfected. ", "23": "So the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,[g] and he was called God's friend. ", "24": "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. ", "25": "And in the same way, wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by a different route? ", "26": "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."}

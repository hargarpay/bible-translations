{"1": "Now I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the gentleness and graciousness of Christ\u2014I who am humble among you in person but bold toward you when absent. ", "2": "I beg you that when I am present I will not need to be bold with the confidence by which I plan to challenge certain people who think we are behaving in an unspiritual way.[a] ", "3": "For though we live in the body,[b] we do not wage war in an unspiritual way,[c] ", "4": "since the weapons of our warfare are not worldly,[d] but are powerful through God for the demolition of strongholds. We demolish arguments ", "5": "and every high-minded thing that is raised up against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to obey Christ. ", "6": "And we are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience has been confirmed.", "7": "Look at what is obvious.[e] If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we. ", "8": "For if I boast some more about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I am not ashamed. ", "9": "I don't want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters. ", "10": "For it is said, \u201cHis letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak, and his public speaking is despicable.\u201d ", "11": "Such a person should consider this: What we are in the words of our letters when absent, we will be in actions when present.", "12": "For we don't dare classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. But in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves to themselves, they lack understanding. ", "13": "We, however, will not boast beyond measure but according to the measure of the area of ministry that God has assigned to us, which reaches even to you. ", "14": "For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we have come to you with the gospel of Christ. ", "15": "We are not bragging beyond measure about other people's labors. But we have the hope that as your faith increases, our area of ministry will be greatly enlarged, ", "16": "so that we may proclaim the good news to the regions beyond you, not boasting about what has already been done in someone else's area of ministry. ", "17": "So the one who boasts must boast in the Lord.[f] ", "18": "For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one the Lord commends."}

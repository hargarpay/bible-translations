", "4": "Indeed, we groan while we are in this tent, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life. ", "5": "And the One who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment.", "6": "So, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. ", "7": "For we walk by faith, not by sight, ", "8": "and we are confident and satisfied to be out of the body and at home with the Lord. ", "9": "Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to be pleasing to Him.

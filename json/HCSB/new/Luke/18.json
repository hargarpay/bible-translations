", "7": "Will not God grant justice to His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He delay to help them?[c] ", "8": "I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith[d] on earth?\u201d", "9": "He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else: ", "10": "\u201cTwo men went up to the temple complex to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

", "14": "I tell you, this one went down to his house justified rather than the other; because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d", "15": "Some people were even bringing infants to Him so He might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

But at Your word, I'll let down the nets.\u201d[d]", "6": "When they did this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets[e] began to tear. ", "7": "So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.", "8": "When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, \u201cGo away from me, because I'm a sinful man, Lord!\u201d ", "9": "For he and all those with him were amazed[f] at the catch of fish they took, ", "10": "and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons, who were Simon's partners. \u201cDon't be afraid,\u201d Jesus told Simon. \u201cFrom now on you will be catching people!\u201d ", "11": "Then they brought the boats to land, left everything, and followed Him.", "12": "While He was in one of the towns, a man was there who had a serious skin disease all over him.

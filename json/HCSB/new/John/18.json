{"1": "After Jesus had said these things, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, and He and His disciples went into it. ", "2": "Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with His disciples. ", "3": "So Judas took a company of soldiers and some temple police from the chief priests and the Pharisees and came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing everything that was about to happen to Him, went out and said to them, \u201cWho is it you're looking for?\u201d", "5": "\u201cJesus the Nazarene,\u201d they answered. \u201cI am He,\u201d[a] Jesus told them. Judas, who betrayed Him, was also standing with them. ", "6": "When He told them, \u201cI am He,\u201d they stepped back and fell to the ground.", "7": "Then He asked them again, \u201cWho is it you're looking for?\u201d \u201cJesus the Nazarene,\u201d they said.", "8": "\u201cI told you I am He,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cSo if you're looking for Me, let these men go.\u201d ", "9": "This was to fulfill the words He had said: \u201cI have not lost one of those You have given Me.\u201d", "10": "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. (The slave's name was Malchus.)", "11": "At that, Jesus said to Peter, \u201cSheathe your sword! Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given Me?\u201d", "12": "Then the company of soldiers, the commander, and the Jewish temple police arrested Jesus and tied Him up. ", "13": "First they led Him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. ", "14": "Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was advantageous that one man should die for the people.", "15": "Meanwhile, Simon Peter was following Jesus, as was another disciple. That disciple was an acquaintance of the high priest; so he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard. ", "16": "But Peter remained standing outside by the door. So the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who was the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.", "17": "Then the slave girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, \u201cYou aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?\u201d \u201cI am not!\u201d he said. ", "18": "Now the slaves and the temple police had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold. They were standing there warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, warming himself.", "19": "The high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching.", "20": "\u201cI have spoken openly to the world,\u201d Jesus answered him. \u201cI have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple complex, where all the Jews congregate, and I haven't spoken anything in secret. ", "21": "Why do you question Me? Question those who heard what I told them. Look, they know what I said.\u201d", "22": "When He had said these things, one of the temple police standing by slapped Jesus, saying, \u201cIs this the way you answer the high priest?\u201d", "23": "\u201cIf I have spoken wrongly,\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cgive evidence[b] about the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit Me?\u201d", "24": "Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, \u201cYou aren't one of His disciples too, are you?\u201d He denied it and said, \u201cI am not!\u201d", "26": "One of the high priest's slaves, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \u201cDidn't I see you with Him in the garden?\u201d", "27": "Peter then denied it again. Immediately a rooster crowed.", "28": "Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They did not enter the headquarters themselves; otherwise they would be defiled and unable to eat the Passover.", "29": "Then Pilate came out to them and said, \u201cWhat charge do you bring against this man?\u201d", "30": "They answered him, \u201cIf this man weren't a criminal,[c] we wouldn't have handed Him over to you.\u201d", "31": "So Pilate told them, \u201cTake Him yourselves and judge Him according to your law.\u201d \u201cIt's not legal[d] for us to put anyone to death,\u201d the Jews declared. ", "32": "They said this so that Jesus' words might be fulfilled signifying what kind of death He was going to die.", "33": "Then Pilate went back into the headquarters, summoned Jesus, and said to Him, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d", "34": "Jesus answered, \u201cAre you asking this on your own, or have others told you about Me?\u201d", "35": "\u201cI'm not a Jew, am I?\u201d Pilate replied. \u201cYour own nation and the chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?\u201d", "36": "\u201cMy kingdom is not of this world,\u201d said Jesus. \u201cIf My kingdom were of this world, My servants[e] would fight, so that I wouldn't be handed over to the Jews. As it is, My kingdom does not have its origin here.\u201d[f]", "37": "\u201cYou are a king then?\u201d Pilate asked. \u201cYou say that I'm a king,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cI was born for this, and I have come into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice.\u201d", "38": "\u201cWhat is truth?\u201d said Pilate. After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, \u201cI find no grounds for charging Him. ", "39": "You have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at the Passover.

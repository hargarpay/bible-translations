{"1": "Now concerning what comes from the Spirit:[a] brothers, I do not want you to be unaware. ", "2": "You know that when you were pagans, you used to be led off to the idols that could not speak. ", "3": "Therefore I am informing you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, \u201cJesus is cursed,\u201d and no one can say, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d except by the Holy Spirit.", "4": "Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. ", "5": "There are different ministries, but the same Lord. ", "6": "And there are different activities, but the same God activates each gift in each person.[b] ", "7": "A demonstration of the Spirit is given to each person to produce what is beneficial:", "8": "to one is given a message of wisdom through the Spirit, to another, a message of knowledge by the same Spirit,", "9": "to another, faith by the same Spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit,", "10": "to another, the performing of miracles, to another, prophecy, to another, distinguishing between spirits, to another, different kinds of languages, to another, interpretation of languages.", "11": "But one and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each person as He wills.", "12": "For as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of that body, though many, are one body\u2014so also is Christ. ", "13": "For we were all baptized by[c] one Spirit into one body\u2014whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free\u2014and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. ", "14": "So the body is not one part but many. ", "15": "If the foot should say, \u201cBecause I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body,\u201d in spite of this it still belongs to the body.

", "24": "But our presentable parts have no need of clothing. Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable, ", "25": "so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same concern for each other.

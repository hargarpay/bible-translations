", "3": "But every spirit who does not confess Jesus[b] is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that he is coming, and he is already in the world now.", "4": "You are from God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.

Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.", "7": "Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

", "4": "The Philistines came together and camped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel, and they camped at Gilboa. ", "5": "When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and trembled violently. ", "6": "He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him in dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets. ", "7": "Saul then said to his servants, \u201cFind me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.\u201d His servants replied, \u201cThere is a woman at En-dor who is a medium.\u201d", "8": "Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes and set out with two of his men.

Bring up for me the one I tell you.\u201d", "9": "But the woman said to him, \u201cYou surely know what Saul has done, how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land. Why are you setting a trap for me to get me killed?\u201d", "10": "Then Saul swore to her by the Lord: \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, nothing bad will happen to you because of this.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWho is it that you want me to bring up for you?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cBring up Samuel for me,\u201d he answered.", "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, and then she asked Saul, \u201cWhy did you deceive me? You are Saul!\u201d", "13": "But the king said to her, \u201cDon't be afraid. What do you see?\u201d \u201cI see a spirit form[b] coming up out of the earth,\u201d the woman answered.", "14": "Then Saul asked her, \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d \u201cAn old man is coming up,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe's wearing a robe.\u201d Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed his face to the ground and paid homage.", "15": "\u201cWhy have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\u201d Samuel asked Saul. \u201cI'm in serious trouble,\u201d replied Saul. \u201cThe Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He doesn't answer me anymore, either through the prophets or in dreams. So I've called on you to tell me what I should do.\u201d", "16": "Samuel answered, \u201cSince the Lord has turned away from you and has become your enemy, why are you asking me?

Eat and it will give you strength so you can go on your way.\u201d", "23": "He refused, saying, \u201cI won't eat,\u201d but when his servants and the woman urged him, he listened to them. He got up off the ground and sat on the bed.", "24": "The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.

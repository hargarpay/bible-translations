{"1": "When David had finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan committed himself to David, and loved him as much as he loved himself. ", "2": "Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him return to his father's house.", "3": "Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as much as himself. ", "4": "Then Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his military tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt.", "5": "David marched out with the army and was successful in everything Saul sent him to do. Saul put him in command of the soldiers, which pleased all the people and Saul's servants as well.", "6": "As the troops were coming back, when David was returning from killing the Philistine, the women came out from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul, singing and dancing with tambourines, with shouts of joy, and with three-stringed instruments. ", "7": "As they celebrated, the women sang: Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands.", "8": "Saul was furious and resented this song.[a] \u201cThey credited tens of thousands to David,\u201d he complained, \u201cbut they only credited me with thousands. What more can he have but the kingdom?\u201d ", "9": "So Saul watched David jealously from that day forward.", "10": "The next day an evil spirit sent from God took control of Saul, and he began to rave[b] inside the palace. David was playing the lyre as usual, but Saul was holding a spear, ", "11": "and he threw it, thinking, \u201cI'll pin David to the wall.\u201d But David got away from him twice.", "12": "Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had left Saul.

", "17": "Saul told David, \u201cHere is my oldest daughter Merab. I'll give her to you as a wife, if you will be a warrior for me and fight the Lord's battles.\u201d But Saul was thinking, \u201cMy hand doesn't need to be against him; let the hand of the Philistines be against him.\u201d", "18": "Then David responded, \u201cWho am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel that I should become the king's son-in-law?\u201d ", "19": "When it was time to give Saul's daughter Merab to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.", "20": "Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David, and when it was reported to Saul, it pleased him.[c] ", "21": "\u201cI'll give her to him,\u201d Saul thought. \u201cShe'll be a trap for him, and the hand of the Philistines will be against him.\u201d So Saul said to David a second time, \u201cYou can now be my son-in-law.\u201d", "22": "Saul then ordered his servants, \u201cSpeak to David in private and tell him, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you.

As a result, Saul was David's enemy from then on.", "30": "Every time the Philistine commanders came out to fight, David was more successful than all of Saul's officers. So his name became well known."}

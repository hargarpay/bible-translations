Kill men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.'\u201d", "4": "Then Saul summoned the troops and counted them at Telaim: 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men from Judah. ", "5": "Saul came to the city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the wadi. ", "6": "He warned the Kenites, \u201cSince you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came out of Egypt, go on and leave! Get away from the Amalekites, or I'll sweep you away with them.\u201d So the Kenites withdrew from the Amalekites.", "7": "Then Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is next to Egypt. ", "8": "He captured Agag king of Amalek alive, but he completely destroyed all the rest of the people with the sword. ", "9": "Saul and the troops spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, cattle, and choice animals,[b] as well as the young rams and the best of everything else. They were not willing to destroy them, but they did destroy all the worthless and unwanted things.", "10": "Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, ", "11": "\u201cI regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My instructions.\u201d So Samuel became angry and cried out to the Lord all night.", "12": "Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but it was reported to Samuel, \u201cSaul went to Carmel where he set up a monument for himself.

Look: to obey is better than sacrifice, to pay attention is better than the fat of rams.", "23": "For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and defiance is like wickedness and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king.", "24": "Saul answered Samuel, \u201cI have sinned. I have transgressed the Lord's command and your words.

Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel.

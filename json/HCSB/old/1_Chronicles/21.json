", "2": "So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, \u201cGo and count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and bring a report to me so I can know their number.\u201d", "3": "Joab replied, \u201cMay the Lord multiply the number of His people a hundred times over! My lord the king, aren't they all my lord's servants? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?\u201d", "4": "Yet the king's order prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel and then returned to Jerusalem. ", "5": "Joab gave the total troop registration to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 swordsmen and in Judah itself 470,000 swordsmen. ", "6": "But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king's command was detestable to him. ", "7": "This command was also evil in God's sight, so He afflicted Israel.", "8": "David said to God, \u201cI have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now, please take away Your servant's guilt, for I've been very foolish.\u201d", "9": "Then the Lord instructed Gad, David's seer, ", "10": "\u201cGo and say to David, 'This is what the Lord says: I am offering you three choices. Choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.'\u201d", "11": "So Gad went to David and said to him, \u201cThis is what the Lord says: 'Take your choice: ", "12": "three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes with the sword of your enemy overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the Lord\u2014a plague on the land, the angel of the Lord bringing destruction to the whole territory of Israel.' Now decide what answer I should take back to the One who sent me.\u201d", "13": "David answered Gad, \u201cI'm in anguish. Please, let me fall into the Lord's hands because His mercies are very great, but don't let me fall into human hands.\u201d", "14": "So the Lord sent a plague on Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died. ", "15": "Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city,[b] the Lord looked, relented concerning the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, \u201cEnough, withdraw your hand now!\u201d The angel of the Lord was then standing at the threshing floor of Ornan[c] the Jebusite.", "16": "When David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell down with their faces to the ground.

My Lord God, please let Your hand be against me and against my father's family, but don't let the plague be against Your people.\u201d", "18": "So the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

Give it to me for the full price, so the plague on the people may be stopped.\u201d", "23": "Ornan said to David, \u201cTake it! My lord the king may do whatever he wants.[d] See, I give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering\u2014I give it all.\u201d", "24": "King David answered Ornan, \u201cNo, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the Lord what belongs to you or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.\u201d", "25": "So David gave Ornan 15 pounds of gold[e] for the plot. ", "26": "He built an altar to the Lord there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the Lord, and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.", "27": "Then the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. ", "28": "At that time, David offered sacrifices there when he saw that the Lord answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

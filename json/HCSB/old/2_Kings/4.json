{"1": "One of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, \u201cYour servant, my husband, has died. You know that your servant feared the Lord. Now the creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves.\u201d", "2": "Elisha asked her, \u201cWhat can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?\u201d She said, \u201cYour servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.\u201d", "3": "Then he said, \u201cGo and borrow empty containers from everyone\u2014from all your neighbors. Do not get just a few. ", "4": "Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these containers. Set the full ones to one side.\u201d ", "5": "So she left. After she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing her containers, and she kept pouring. ", "6": "When they were full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another container.\u201d But he replied, \u201cThere aren't any more.\u201d Then the oil stopped.", "7": "She went and told the man of God, and he said, \u201cGo sell the oil and pay your debt; you and your sons can live on the rest.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha went to Shunem. A prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to eat some food. So whenever he passed by, he stopped there to eat. ", "9": "Then she said to her husband, \u201cI know that the one who often passes by here is a holy man of God, ", "10": "so let's make a small room upstairs and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him. Whenever he comes, he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "One day he came there and stopped and went to the room upstairs to lie down. ", "12": "He ordered his attendant Gehazi, \u201cCall this Shunammite woman.\u201d So he called her and she stood before him.", "13": "Then he said to Gehazi, \u201cSay to her, 'Look, you've gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?'\u201d She answered, \u201cI am living among my own people.\u201d", "14": "So he asked, \u201cThen what should be done for her?\u201d Gehazi answered, \u201cWell, she has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "\u201cCall her,\u201d Elisha said. So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. ", "16": "Elisha said, \u201cAt this time next year you will have a son in your arms.\u201d Then she said, \u201cNo, my lord. Man of God, do not deceive your servant.\u201d", "17": "The woman conceived and gave birth to a son at the same time the following year, as Elisha had promised her.", "18": "The child grew and one day went out to his father and the harvesters. ", "19": "Suddenly he complained to his father, \u201cMy head! My head!\u201d His father told his servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d ", "20": "So he picked him up and took him to his mother. The child sat on her lap until noon and then died. ", "21": "Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut him in, and left.", "22": "She summoned her husband and said, \u201cPlease send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can hurry to the man of God and then come back.\u201d", "23": "But he said, \u201cWhy go to him today? It's not a New Moon or a Sabbath.\u201d She replied, \u201cEverything is all right.\u201d", "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \u201cHurry, don't slow the pace for me unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to his attendant Gehazi, \u201cLook, there's the Shunammite woman. ", "26": "Run out to meet her and ask, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your son all right?'\u201d And she answered, \u201cEverything's all right.\u201d", "27": "When she came up to the man of God at the mountain, she clung to his feet. Gehazi came to push her away, but the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone\u2014she is in severe anguish, and the Lord has hidden it from me. He hasn't told me.\u201d", "28": "Then she said, \u201cDid I ask my lord for a son? Didn't I say, 'Do not deceive me?'\u201d", "29": "So Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cTuck your mantle under your belt, take my staff with you, and go. If you meet anyone, don't stop to greet him, and if a man greets you, don't answer him. Then place my staff on the boy's face.\u201d", "30": "The boy's mother said to Elisha, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.\u201d So he got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi went ahead of them and placed the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or sign of life, so he went back to meet Elisha and told him, \u201cThe boy didn't wake up.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha got to the house, he discovered the boy lying dead on his bed. ", "33": "So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the Lord. ", "34": "Then he went up and lay on the boy: he put mouth to mouth, eye to eye, hand to hand. While he bent down over him, the boy's flesh became warm. ", "35": "Elisha got up, went into the house, and paced back and forth. Then he went up and bent down over him again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.", "36": "Elisha called Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite woman.\u201d He called her and she came. Then Elisha said, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; she picked up her son and left.", "38": "When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet.[a] He said to his attendant, \u201cPut on the large pot and make stew for the sons of the prophets.\u201d", "39": "One went out to the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment would hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, but they were unaware of what they were.", "40": "They served some for the men to eat, but when they ate the stew they cried out, \u201cThere's death in the pot, man of God!\u201d And they were unable to eat it.", "41": "Then Elisha said, \u201cGet some meal.\u201d He threw it into the pot and said, \u201cServe it for the people to eat.\u201d And there was nothing bad in the pot.", "42": "A man from Baal-shalishah came to the man of God with his sack full of 20 loaves of barley bread from the first bread of the harvest. Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people to eat.\u201d", "43": "But Elisha's attendant asked, \u201cWhat? Am I to set 20 loaves before 100 men?\u201d \u201cGive it to the people to eat,\u201d Elisha said, \u201cfor this is what the Lord says: 'They will eat, and they will have some left over.'\u201d ", "44": "So he gave it to them, and as the Lord had promised, they ate and had some left over."}

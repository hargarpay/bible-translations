Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? ", "3": "God handed over to you Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian. What was I able to do compared to you?\u201d When he said this, their anger against him subsided.", "4": "Gideon and the 300 men came to the Jordan and crossed it.

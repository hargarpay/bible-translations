Testify against Me!", "4": "Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from that place of slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam ahead of you.", "5": "My people, remember what Balak king of Moab proposed, what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and what happened from the Acacia Grove[a] to Gilgal so that you may acknowledge the Lord's righteous acts.", "6": "What should I bring before the Lord when I come to bow before God on high?

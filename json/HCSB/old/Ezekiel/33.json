{"1": "The word of the Lord came to me: ", "2": "\u201cSon of man, speak to your people and tell them: Suppose I bring the sword against a land, and the people of that land select a man from among them, appointing him as their watchman, ", "3": "and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows his trumpet to warn the people. ", "4": "Then, if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet but ignores the warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. ", "5": "Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but ignored the warning, his blood is on his own hands.[a] If he had taken warning, he would have saved his life. ", "6": "However, if the watchman sees the sword coming but doesn't blow the trumpet, so that the people aren't warned, and the sword comes and takes away their lives, then they have been taken away because of their iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.", "7": "\u201cAs for you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me. ", "8": "If I say to the wicked, 'Wicked one, you will surely die,' but you do not speak out to warn him about his way, that wicked person will die for his iniquity, yet I will hold you responsible for his blood.

How then can we survive?'

Repent, repent of your evil ways! Why will you die, house of Israel?", "12": "\u201cNow, son of man, say to your people: The righteousness of the righteous person will not save him on the day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked person cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness. The righteous person won't be able to survive by his righteousness on the day he sins. ", "13": "When I tell the righteous person that he will surely live, but he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, then none of his righteousness will be remembered, and he will die because of the iniquity he has committed.", "14": "\u201cSo when I tell the wicked person, 'You will surely die,' but he repents of his sin and does what is just and right\u2014 ", "15": "he returns collateral, makes restitution for what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without practicing iniquity\u2014he will certainly live; he will not die.

But we are many; the land has been given to us as a possession.'

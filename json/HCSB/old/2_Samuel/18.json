{"1": "David reviewed his troops and appointed commanders of hundreds and of thousands over them. ", "2": "He then sent out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, \u201cI will also march out with you.\u201d", "3": "\u201cYou must not go!\u201d the people pleaded. \u201cIf we have to flee, they will not pay any attention to us. Even if half of us die, they will not pay any attention to us because you are worth[a] 10,000 of us. Therefore, it is better if you support us from the city.\u201d", "4": "\u201cI will do whatever you think is best,\u201d the king replied to them. So he stood beside the gate while all the troops marched out by hundreds and thousands. ", "5": "The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, \u201cTreat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.\u201d All the people heard the king's orders to all the commanders about Absalom.", "6": "Then David's forces marched into the field to engage Israel in battle, which took place in the forest of Ephraim.

", "8": "The battle spread over the entire region, and that day the forest claimed more people than the sword.", "9": "Absalom was riding on his mule when he happened to meet David's soldiers. When the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak tree, Absalom's head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so he was suspended in midair.[b] ", "10": "One of the men saw him and informed Joab. He said, \u201cI just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!\u201d", "11": "\u201cYou just saw him!\u201d Joab exclaimed.[c] \u201cWhy didn't you strike him to the ground right there? I would have given you 10 silver pieces[d] and a belt!\u201d", "12": "The man replied to Joab, \u201cEven if I had the weight of 1,000 pieces of silver[e] in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king's son. For we heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for me.'[f] ", "13": "If I had jeopardized my own[g] life\u2014and nothing is hidden from the king\u2014you would have abandoned me.\u201d", "14": "Joab said, \u201cI'm not going to waste time with you!\u201d He then took three spears in his hand and thrust them into Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the oak tree, ", "15": "and 10 young men who were Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him.", "16": "Afterward, Joab blew the ram's horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab restrained them. ", "17": "They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. And all Israel fled, each to his tent.", "18": "When he was alive, Absalom had set up a pillar for himself in the King's Valley, for he had said, \u201cI have no son to preserve the memory of my name.\u201d So he gave the pillar his name. It is still called Absalom's Monument today.", "19": "Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, \u201cPlease let me run and tell the king the good news that the Lord has delivered him from his enemies.\u201d", "20": "Joab replied to him, \u201cYou are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but today you aren't taking good news, because the king's son is dead.\u201d ", "21": "Joab then said to the Cushite, \u201cGo tell the king what you have seen.\u201d The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running.", "22": "However, Ahimaaz son of Zadok persisted and said to Joab, \u201cNo matter what, please let me also run behind the Cushite!\u201d Joab replied, \u201cMy son, why do you want to run since you won't get a reward?\u201d", "23": "\u201cNo matter what, I want to run!\u201d \u201cThen run!\u201d Joab said to him.

The watchman looked out and saw a man running alone. ", "25": "He called out and told the king. The king said, \u201cIf he's alone, he bears good news.\u201d As the first runner came closer, ", "26": "the watchman saw another man running. He called out to the gatekeeper, \u201cLook! Another man is running alone!\u201d \u201cThis one is also bringing good news,\u201d said the king.", "27": "The watchman said, \u201cThe way the first man runs looks to me like the way Ahimaaz son of Zadok runs.\u201d \u201cThis is a good man; he comes with good news,\u201d the king commented.", "28": "Ahimaaz called out to the king, \u201cAll is well,\u201d and then bowed down to the king with his face to the ground. He continued, \u201cMay the Lord your God be praised! He delivered up the men who rebelled against my lord the king.\u201d", "29": "The king asked, \u201cIs the young man Absalom all right?\u201d Ahimaaz replied, \u201cWhen Joab sent the king's servant and your servant, I saw a big disturbance, but I don't know what it was.\u201d", "30": "The king said, \u201cMove aside and stand here.\u201d So he stood to one side.", "31": "Just then the Cushite came and said, \u201cMay my lord the king hear the good news: today the Lord has delivered you from all those rising up against you!\u201d", "32": "The king asked the Cushite, \u201cIs the young man Absalom all right?\u201d The Cushite replied, \u201cMay what has become of the young man happen to the enemies of my lord the king and to all who rise up against you with evil intent.\u201d", "33": "[h]The king was deeply moved and went up to the gate chamber and wept. As he walked, he cried, \u201cMy son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d"}

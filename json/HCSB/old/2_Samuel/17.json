{"1": "Ahithophel said to Absalom, \u201cLet me choose 12,000 men, and I will set out in pursuit of David tonight. ", "2": "I will attack him while he is weak and weary, throw him into a panic, and all the people with him will scatter. I will strike down only the king ", "3": "and bring all the people back to you. When everyone returns except the man you're seeking, all[a] the people will be at peace.\u201d ", "4": "This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel.", "5": "Then Absalom said, \u201cSummon Hushai the Archite also. Let's hear what he has to say as well.\u201d", "6": "So Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom told him: \u201cAhithophel offered this proposal. Should we carry out his proposal? If not, what do you say?\u201d", "7": "Hushai replied to Absalom, \u201cThe advice Ahithophel has given this time is not good.\u201d ", "8": "Hushai continued, \u201cYou know your father and his men. They are warriors and are desperate like a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier who won't spend the night with the people.

If some of our troops fall[c] first, someone is sure to hear and say, 'There's been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.' ", "10": "Then, even a brave man with the heart of a lion will melt because all Israel knows that your father and the valiant men with him are warriors. ", "11": "Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba\u2014as numerous as the sand by the sea\u2014be gathered to you and that you personally go into battle.

", "13": "If he retreats to some city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag its stones into the valley until not even a pebble can be found there.\u201d ", "14": "Since the Lord had decreed that Ahithophel's good advice be undermined in order to bring about Absalom's ruin, Absalom and all the men of Israel said, \u201cThe advice of Hushai the Archite is better than Ahithophel's advice.\u201d", "15": "Hushai then told the priests Zadok and Abiathar, \u201cThis is what[d] Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what[e] I advised.

They in turn would go and inform King David, because they dared not be seen entering the city. ", "18": "However, a young man did see them and informed Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.

The men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.", "21": "After they had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well and went and informed King David. They told him, \u201cGet up and immediately ford the river, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.\u201d ", "22": "So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one who had not crossed the Jordan.

They also brought wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,[l] ", "29": "honey, curds, sheep, and cheese[m] from the herd for David and the people with him to eat.

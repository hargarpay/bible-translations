The Lord answered, \u201cIt is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family when he killed the Gibeonites.\u201d", "2": "The Gibeonites were not Israelites but rather a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them, but Saul had tried to kill them in his zeal for the Israelites and Judah. So David summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. ", "3": "He asked the Gibeonites, \u201cWhat should I do for you? How can I make atonement so that you will bring a blessing on[a] the Lord's inheritance?\u201d", "4": "The Gibeonites said to him, \u201cWe are not asking for money from[b] Saul or his family, and we cannot put anyone to death in Israel.\u201d \u201cWhatever you say, I will do for you,\u201d he said.", "5": "They replied to the king, \u201cAs for the man who annihilated us and plotted to destroy us so we would not exist within the whole territory of Israel, ", "6": "let seven of his male descendants be handed over to us so we may hang[c] them in the presence of the Lord at Gibeah of Saul, the Lord's chosen.\u201d The king answered, \u201cI will hand them over.\u201d", "7": "David spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the oath of the Lord that was between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.

They hanged[e] them on the hill in the presence of the Lord; the seven of them died together. They were executed in the first days of the harvest at the beginning of the barley harvest.[f]", "10": "Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock from the beginning of the harvest[g] until the rain poured down from heaven on the bodies. She kept the birds of the sky from them by day and the wild animals by night.", "11": "When it was reported to David what Saul's concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done, ", "12": "he went and got the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the leaders of Jabesh-gilead. They had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung the bodies the day the Philistines killed Saul at Gilboa. ", "13": "David had the bones brought from there. They gathered up the bones of Saul's family who had been hung[h] ", "14": "and buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan at Zela in the land of Benjamin in the tomb of Saul's father Kish.

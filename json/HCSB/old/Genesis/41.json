Then Pharaoh woke up, and it was only a dream.", "8": "When morning came, he was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.", "9": "Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \u201cToday I remember my faults. ", "10": "Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard. ", "11": "He and I had dreams on the same night; each dream had its own meaning. ", "12": "Now a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guards, was with us there.

", "23": "After them, seven heads of grain\u2014withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind\u2014sprouted up. ", "24": "The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones.

", "34": "Let Pharaoh do this: Let him appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the harvest of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. ", "35": "Let them gather all the excess food during these good years that are coming. Under Pharaoh's authority, store the grain in the cities, so they may preserve it as food. ", "36": "The food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine that will take place in the land of Egypt. Then the country will not be wiped out by the famine.\u201d", "37": "The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. ", "38": "Then Pharaoh said to his servants, \u201cCan we find anyone like this, a man who has God's spirit[c] in him?\u201d ", "39": "So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cSince God has made all this known to you, there is no one as intelligent and wise as you are.

", "48": "Joseph gathered all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and put it in the cities. He put the food in every city from the fields around it. ", "49": "So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance\u2014like the sand of the sea\u2014that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.", "50": "Two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine arrived.

There was famine in every country, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food. ", "55": "Extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food.

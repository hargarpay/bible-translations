The Lord takes vengeance against His foes; He is furious with His enemies.", "3": "The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will never leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.", "4": "He rebukes the sea so that it dries up, and He makes all the rivers run dry.

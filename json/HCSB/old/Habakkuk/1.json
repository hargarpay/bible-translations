{"1": "The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.", "2": "How long, Lord, must I call for help and You do not listen or cry out to You about violence and You do not save?", "3": "Why do You force me to look at injustice? Why do You tolerate[a] wrongdoing? Oppression and violence are right in front of me. Strife is ongoing, and conflict escalates.", "4": "This is why the law is ineffective and justice never emerges. For the wicked restrict the righteous; therefore, justice comes out perverted.", "5": "Look at the nations[b] and observe\u2014 be utterly astounded! For something is taking place in your days that you will not believe when you hear about it.", "6": "Look! I am raising up the Chaldeans,[c] that bitter, impetuous nation that marches across the earth's open spaces to seize territories not its own.", "7": "They are fierce and terrifying; their views of justice and sovereignty stem from themselves.", "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards and more fierce[d] than wolves of the night. Their horsemen charge ahead; their horsemen come from distant lands. They fly like an eagle, swooping to devour.", "9": "All of them come to do violence; their faces are set in determination.[e] They gather prisoners like sand.", "10": "They mock kings, and rulers are a joke to them. They laugh at every fortress and build siege ramps to capture it.", "11": "Then they sweep by like the wind and pass through. They are guilty;[f] their strength is their god.", "12": "Are You not from eternity, Yahweh my God? My Holy One, You[g] will not die. Lord, You appointed them to execute judgment; my Rock, You destined them to punish us.", "13": "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil, and You cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do You tolerate those who are treacherous? Why are You silent while one[h] who is wicked swallows up one[i] who is more righteous than himself?", "14": "You have made mankind like the fish of the sea, like marine creatures that have no ruler.", "15": "The Chaldeans pull them all up with a hook, catch them in their dragnet, and gather them in their fishing net; that is why they are glad and rejoice.", "16": "That is why they sacrifice to their dragnet and burn incense to their fishing net, for by these things their portion is rich and their food plentiful.", "17": "Will they therefore empty their net[j] and continually slaughter nations without mercy?"}

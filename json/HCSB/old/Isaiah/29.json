{"1": "Woe to Ariel,[a] Ariel, the city where David camped! Continue year after year; let the festivals recur.", "2": "I will oppress Ariel, and there will be mourning and crying, and she will be to Me like an Ariel.[b]", "3": "I will camp in a circle around you; I will besiege you with earth ramps, and I will set up my siege towers against you.", "4": "You will be brought down; you will speak from the ground, and your words will come from low in the dust. Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground; your speech will whisper from the dust.", "5": "Your many foes[c] will be like fine dust, and many of the ruthless, like blowing chaff. Then suddenly, in an instant,", "6": "you will be visited by the Lord of Hosts with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise, storm, tempest, and a flame of consuming fire.", "7": "All the many nations going out to battle against Ariel\u2014 all the attackers, the siege works against her, and those who oppress her\u2014 will then be like a dream, a vision in the night.", "8": "It will be like a hungry one who dreams he is eating, then wakes and is still hungry; and like a thirsty one who dreams he is drinking, then wakes and is still thirsty, longing for water.

If it is given to one who can read and he is asked to read it,[g] he will say, \u201cI can't read it, because it is sealed.\u201d ", "12": "And if the document is given to one who cannot read and he is asked to read it,[h] he will say, \u201cI can't read.\u201d", "13": "The Lord said: Because these people approach Me with their mouths to honor Me with lip-service[i]\u2014 yet their hearts are far from Me, and their worship consists of man-made rules learned by rote\u2014", "14": "therefore I will again confound these people with wonder after wonder. The wisdom of their wise men will vanish, and the understanding of the perceptive will be hidden.", "15": "Woe to those who go to great lengths to hide their plans from the Lord. They do their works in darkness, and say, \u201cWho sees us? Who knows us?\u201d", "16": "You have turned things around, as if the potter were the same as the clay.

{"1": "The Spirit of the Lord God is on Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to heal[a] the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners;", "2": "to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of our God's vengeance; to comfort all who mourn,", "3": "to provide for those who mourn in Zion; to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, festive oil instead of mourning, and splendid clothes instead of despair.[b] And they will be called righteous trees, planted by the Lord to glorify Him.", "4": "They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the former devastations; they will renew the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.", "5": "Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.", "6": "But you will be called the Lord's priests; they will speak of you as ministers of our God; you will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their riches.", "7": "Because your shame was double, and they cried out, \u201cDisgrace is their portion,\u201d therefore, they will possess double in their land, and eternal joy will be theirs.", "8": "For I Yahweh love justice; I hate robbery and injustice;[c] I will faithfully reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.", "9": "Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their posterity among the peoples. All who see them will recognize that they are a people the Lord has blessed.", "10": "I greatly rejoice in the Lord, I exult in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a groom wears a turban and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.", "11": "For as the earth produces its growth, and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations."}

{"1": "Who has believed what we have heard?[a] And who has the arm of the Lord been revealed to?", "2": "He grew up before Him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground. He didn't have an impressive form or majesty that we should look at Him, no appearance that we should desire Him.", "3": "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering who knew what sickness was. He was like someone people turned away from;[b] He was despised, and we didn't value Him.", "4": "Yet He Himself bore our sicknesses, and He carried our pains; but we in turn regarded Him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.", "5": "But He was pierced because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on Him, and we are healed by His wounds.", "6": "We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the Lord has punished Him for[c] the iniquity of us all.", "7": "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, He did not open His mouth.", "8": "He was taken away because of oppression and judgment; and who considered His fate?[d] For He was cut off from the land of the living; He was struck because of my people's rebellion.", "9": "They[e] made His grave with the wicked and with a rich man at His death, although He had done no violence and had not spoken deceitfully.", "10": "Yet the Lord was pleased to crush Him severely.[f] When[g] You make Him a restitution offering, He will see His seed, He will prolong His days, and by His hand, the Lord's pleasure will be accomplished.", "11": "He will see it[h] out of His anguish, and He will be satisfied with His knowledge. My righteous Servant will justify many, and He will carry their iniquities.", "12": "Therefore I will give Him[i] the many as a portion, and He will receive[j] the mighty as spoil, because He submitted Himself to death, and was counted among the rebels; yet He bore the sin of many and interceded for the rebels."}

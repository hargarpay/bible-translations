Let My people go, that they may worship Me. ", "4": "But if you refuse to let My people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. ", "5": "They will cover the surface of the land so that no one will be able to see the land. They will eat the remainder left to you that escaped the hail; they will eat every tree you have growing in the fields.

This is written in the law of Moses, so that you will have success in everything you do and wherever you turn, ", "4": "and so that the Lord will carry out His promise that He made to me: 'If your sons are careful to walk faithfully before Me with their whole mind and heart, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'", "5": "\u201cYou also know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two commanders of Israel's army, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He murdered them in a time of peace to avenge blood shed in war. He spilled that blood on his own waistband and on the sandals of his feet.[a] ", "6": "Act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head descend to Sheol in peace.", "7": "\u201cShow loyalty to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table because they supported me when I fled from your brother Absalom.", "8": "\u201cKeep an eye on Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim who is with you. He uttered malicious curses against me the day I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, and I swore to him by the Lord: 'I will never kill you with the sword.'

You know how to deal with him to bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.\u201d", "10": "Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.

Don't turn me down.\u201d \u201cGo ahead and ask, mother,\u201d the king replied, \u201cfor I won't turn you down.\u201d", "21": "So she said, \u201cLet Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.\u201d", "22": "King Solomon answered his mother, \u201cWhy are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my elder brother, you might as well ask the kingship for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah.\u201d[d] ", "23": "Then Solomon took an oath by the Lord: \u201cMay God punish me and do so severely if Adonijah has not made this request at the cost of his life.

Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death today, since you carried the ark of the Lord God in the presence of my father David and you suffered through all that my father suffered.\u201d ", "27": "So Solomon banished Abiathar from being the Lord's priest, and it fulfilled the Lord's prophecy He had spoken at Shiloh against Eli's family.", "28": "The news reached Joab.

Strike him down and bury him in order to remove from me and from my father's house the blood that Joab shed without just cause.

Therefore, the Lord has brought back your evil on your head, ", "45": "but King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain established before the Lord forever.\u201d", "46": "Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in Solomon's hand."}

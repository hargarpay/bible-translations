Through him all people could hear about the light and believe.", "8": "John was not the light. But he came to tell people about the light.", "9": "The true light was coming into the world. This is the true light that gives light to all people.", "10": "The Word was already in the world. The world was made through him, but the world did not know him.", "11": "He came to the world that was his own. And his own people did not accept him.", "12": "But some people did accept him. They believed in him, and he gave them the right to become children of God.", "13": "They became God's children, but not in the way babies are usually born. It was not because of any human desire or plan. They were born from God himself.", "14": "The Word became a man and lived among us. We saw his divine greatness\u2014the greatness that belongs to the only Son of the Father. The Word was full of grace and truth.", "15": "John told people about him.

The only Son is the one who has shown us what God is like. He is himself God and is very close to the Father.[e]", "19": "The Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent some priests and Levites to John to ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d He told them the truth.", "20": "Without any hesitation he said openly and plainly, \u201cI am not the Messiah.\u201d", "21": "They asked him, \u201cThen who are you? Are you Elijah?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo, I am not Elijah.\u201d They asked, \u201cAre you the Prophet[f]?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo, I am not the Prophet.\u201d", "22": "Then they said, \u201cWho are you? Tell us about yourself. Give us an answer to tell the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d", "23": "John told them the words of the prophet Isaiah: \u201cI am the voice of someone shouting in the desert: 'Make a straight road ready for the Lord.'\u201d ", "24": "These Jews were sent from the Pharisees.", "25": "They said to John, \u201cYou say you are not the Messiah. You say you are not Elijah or the Prophet. Then why do you baptize people?\u201d", "26": "John answered, \u201cI baptize people with water.

But I came baptizing people with water so that Israel could know that he is the Messiah.[g]\u201d", "32-34": "Then John said this for everyone to hear: \u201cI also did not know who the Messiah was. But the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man. He is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' I have seen this happen. I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on this man. So this is what I tell people: 'He is the Son of God.'[h]\u201d", "35": "The next day John was there again and had two of his followers with him.", "36": "He saw Jesus walking by and said, \u201cLook, the Lamb of God!\u201d", "37": "The two followers heard him say this, so they followed Jesus.", "38": "Jesus turned and saw the two men following him. He asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d They said, \u201cRabbi, where are you staying?\u201d (\u201cRabbi\u201d means \u201cTeacher.\u201d)", "39": "He answered, \u201cCome with me and you will see.\u201d So the two men went with him. They saw the place where he was staying, and they stayed there with him that day. It was about four o'clock.", "40": "These men followed Jesus after they had heard about him from John. One of them was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.", "41": "The first thing Andrew did was to go and find his brother Simon. Andrew said to him, \u201cWe have found the Messiah.\u201d (\u201cMessiah\u201d means \u201cChrist.\u201d)", "42": "Then Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \u201cYou are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas.\u201d (\u201cCephas\u201d means \u201cPeter.[i]\u201d)", "43": "The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He met Philip and said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d", "44": "Philip was from the town of Bethsaida, the same as Andrew and Peter.", "45": "Philip found Nathanael and told him, \u201cWe have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law. The prophets wrote about him too. He is Jesus, the son of Joseph. He is from Nazareth.\u201d", "46": "But Nathanael said to Philip, \u201cNazareth! Can anything good come from Nazareth?\u201d Philip answered, \u201cCome and see.\u201d", "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said, \u201cThis man coming is a true Israelite, one you can trust.[j]\u201d", "48": "Nathanael asked, \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cI saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip told you about me.\u201d", "49": "Then Nathanael said, \u201cTeacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.\u201d", "50": "Jesus said to him, \u201cDo you believe this just because I said I saw you under the fig tree? You will see much greater things than that!\u201d", "51": "Then he said, \u201cBelieve me when I say that you will all see heaven open. You will see 'angels of God going up and coming down'[k] on the Son of Man.\u201d"}

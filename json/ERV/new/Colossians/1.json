You were his enemies in your minds, because the evil you did was against him.", "22": "But now he has made you his friends again. He did this by the death Christ suffered while he was in his body. He did it so that he could present you to himself as people who are holy, blameless, and without anything that would make you guilty before him.", "23": "And that is what will happen if you continue to believe in the Good News you heard.

We are trying to bring everyone before God as people who have grown to be spiritually mature in Christ.", "29": "To do this, I work and struggle using the great strength that Christ gives me. That strength is working in my life."}

So he said to them, \u201cWhy do you have these questions in your minds?", "9-10": "The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. But how can I prove this to you? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say to the crippled man, 'Your sins are forgiven.' There's no proof it really happened. But what if I say to the man, 'Stand up. Take your mat and walk'? Then you will be able to see if I really have this power or not.\u201d So Jesus said to the paralyzed man,", "11": "\u201cI tell you, stand up.

After three days, he will rise from death.\u201d", "32": "But the followers did not understand what he meant, and they were afraid to ask him.", "33": "Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. They went into a house, and Jesus said to them, \u201cI heard you arguing on the way here today. What were you arguing about?\u201d", "34": "But the followers did not answer, because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest.", "35": "Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him.

Be healed!\u201d Immediately the man was healed from his leprosy.", "4": "Then Jesus said to him, \u201cDon't tell anyone about what happened.

There are people who have authority over me, and I have soldiers under my authority. I tell one soldier, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell another soldier, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and my servant obeys me.\u201d", "10": "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed.

We will drown!\u201d", "26": "Jesus answered, \u201cWhy are you afraid? You don't have enough faith.\u201d Then he stood up and gave a command to the wind and the water.

Did you come here to punish us before the right time?\u201d", "30": "Near that place there was a large herd of pigs feeding.", "31": "The demons begged Jesus, \u201cIf you make us leave these men, please send us into that herd of pigs.\u201d", "32": "Jesus said to them, \u201cGo!\u201d So the demons left the men and went into the pigs. Then the whole herd of pigs ran down the hill into the lake, and all were drowned.", "33": "The men who had the work of caring for the pigs ran away. They went into town and told the people everything that happened, especially about the men who had the demons.", "34": "Then the whole town went out to see Jesus.

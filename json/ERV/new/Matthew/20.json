One morning, the man went out very early to hire some people to work in his vineyard.", "2": "He agreed to pay the workers one silver coin for working that day. Then he sent them into the vineyard to work.", "3": "\u201cAbout nine o'clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there. They were doing nothing.", "4": "So he said to them, 'If you go and work in my field, I will pay you what your work is worth.'", "5": "So they went to work in the vineyard. \u201cThe man went out again about twelve o'clock and again at three o'clock. Both times he hired some others to work in his vineyard.", "6": "About five o'clock the man went to the marketplace again. He saw some other people standing there. He asked them, 'Why did you stand here all day doing nothing?'", "7": "\u201cThey said, 'No one gave us a job.' \u201cThe man said to them, 'Then you can go and work in my vineyard.'", "8": "\u201cAt the end of the day, the owner of the field said to the boss of all the workers, 'Call the workers and pay them all. Start by paying the last people I hired. Then pay all of them, ending with the ones I hired first.'", "9": "\u201cThe workers who were hired at five o'clock came to get their pay. Each worker got one silver coin.", "10": "Then the workers who were hired first came to get their pay. They thought they would be paid more than the others. But each one of them also received one silver coin.", "11": "When they got their silver coin, they complained to the man who owned the land.", "12": "They said, 'Those people were hired last and worked only one hour. But you paid them the same as us. And we worked hard all day in the hot sun.'", "13": "\u201cBut the man who owned the field said to one of them, 'Friend, I am being fair with you. You agreed to work for one silver coin. Right?", "14": "So take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same pay I gave you.", "15": "I can do what I want with my own money. Why would you be jealous because I am generous?'", "16": "\u201cSo those who are last now will be first in the future.

The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law, and they will say he must die.", "19": "They will hand him over to the foreigners, who will laugh at him and beat him with whips, and then they will kill him on a cross.

Can you drink from the cup[a] that I must drink from?\u201d The sons answered, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d", "23": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIt is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left. My Father has decided who will do that. He has prepared those places for them.\u201d", "24": "The other ten followers heard this and were angry with the two brothers.", "25": "So Jesus called the followers together. He said, \u201cYou know that the rulers of the non-Jewish people love to show their power over the people.

Jesus saw that these people had much faith. So he said to the paralyzed man, \u201cYoung man, you will be glad to hear this. Your sins are forgiven.\u201d", "3": "Some of the teachers of the law heard what Jesus said. They said to themselves, \u201cWhat an insult to God for this man to say that!\u201d", "4": "Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, \u201cWhy are you thinking such evil thoughts?", "5-6": "The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. But how can I prove this to you? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say, 'Your sins are forgiven.' There's no proof that it really happened. But what if I say to the man, 'Stand up and walk'? Then you will be able to see that I really have this power.\u201d So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, \u201cStand up. Take your mat and go home.\u201d", "7": "The man stood up and went home.", "8": "The people saw this and they were amazed. They praised God for letting someone have such power.", "9": "When Jesus was leaving, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place for collecting taxes.

Many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with him and his followers.", "11": "The Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with these people. They asked his followers, \u201cWhy does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners?\u201d", "12": "Jesus heard them say this. So he said to them, \u201cIt is the sick people who need a doctor, not those who are healthy.", "13": "You need to go and learn what this Scripture means: 'I don't want animal sacrifices; I want you to show kindness to people.'[a] I did not come to invite good people. I came to invite sinners.\u201d", "14": "Then the followers of John came to Jesus and said, \u201cWe and the Pharisees fast often, but your followers don't ever fast. Why?\u201d", "15": "Jesus answered, \u201cAt a wedding the friends of the bridegroom are not sad while he is with them. They cannot fast then. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. Then they will fast.", "16": "\u201cWhen someone sews a patch over a hole in an old coat, they never use a piece of cloth that has not already been shrunk. If they do, the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat. Then the hole will be worse.", "17": "Also, people never pour new wine into old wineskins. They would break, the wine would spill out, and the wineskins would be ruined. People always put new wine into new wineskins, which won't break, and the wine stays good.\u201d", "18": "While Jesus was still talking, a leader of the synagogue came to him. The leader bowed down before him and said, \u201cMy daughter has just died.

She came close behind Jesus and touched the bottom of his coat.", "21": "She was thinking, \u201cIf I can touch his coat, I will be healed.\u201d", "22": "Jesus turned and saw the woman. He said, \u201cBe happy, dear woman. You are made well because you believed.\u201d Then the woman was healed.", "23": "Jesus continued going with the Jewish leader and went into the leader's house. He saw people there who make music for funerals. And he saw a crowd of people crying loudly.", "24": "Jesus said, \u201cGo away. The girl is not dead. She is only sleeping.\u201d But the people laughed at him.", "25": "After the people were put out of the house, Jesus went into the girl's room. He held the girl's hand, and the girl stood up.", "26": "The news about this spread all around the area.", "27": "As Jesus was going away from there, two blind men followed him. They said loudly, \u201cShow kindness to us, Son of David.\u201d", "28": "Jesus went inside, and the blind men went with him. He asked them, \u201cDo you believe that I am able to make you see again?\u201d They answered, \u201cYes, Lord, we believe.\u201d", "29": "Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, \u201cYou believe that I can make you see again, so it will happen.\u201d", "30": "Then the men were able to see. Jesus gave them a strong warning. He said, \u201cDon't tell anyone about this.\u201d", "31": "But they left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area.", "32": "As these two men were leaving, some people brought another man to Jesus. This man could not talk because he had a demon inside him.", "33": "Jesus forced the demon out, and the man was able to talk. The people were amazed and said, \u201cWe have never seen anything like this in Israel.\u201d", "34": "But the Pharisees said, \u201cThe ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out.\u201d", "35": "Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues and told people the Good News about God's kingdom. He healed all kinds of diseases and sicknesses.", "36": "Jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless\u2014like sheep without a shepherd to lead them.", "37": "Jesus said to his followers, \u201cThere is such a big harvest of people to bring in. But there are only a few workers to help harvest them.", "38": "God owns the harvest. Ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest.\u201d"}

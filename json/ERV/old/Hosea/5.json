I know what Israel has done. Ephraim, right now you act like a prostitute. Israel is dirty with sin.", "4": "The people of Israel have done many evil things, and these evil things keep them from coming back to their God. They are always thinking of ways to chase after other gods. They don't know the Lord.", "5": "Israel's pride is a witness against them,[e] so Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their sin.

I\u2014yes, I myself\u2014will rip them to pieces. I will carry them away, and no one can save them.", "15": "I will go back to my place, until the people admit they are guilty, until they come looking for me.

So you should tell your family what they should do when you die. You will not get well.'\u201d", "2": "Hezekiah turned toward the wall that faced the Temple and began praying to the Lord.", "3": "\u201cLord, remember that I have faithfully served you with all my heart. I have done what you say is good.\u201d Then Hezekiah cried very hard.", "4": "Then Isaiah received this message from the Lord:", "5": "\u201cGo to Hezekiah and tell him that the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says, 'I heard your prayer, and I saw your tears. I will add 15 years to your life.", "6": "I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will protect this city.'\u201d", "21": "[a] Then Isaiah told Hezekiah, \u201cCrush figs together and put them on your sore. Then you will get well.\u201d", "22": "Hezekiah asked Isaiah, \u201cWhat is the sign that proves I will get well and go to the Lord's Temple?\u201d", "7": "This is the sign from the Lord to show you that he will do what he says:", "8": "\u201cLook, I am causing the shadow that is on the steps of Ahaz[b] to move back ten steps. The sun's shadow will go back up the ten steps that it has already been on.\u201d", "9": "This is the letter from Hezekiah when he became well:", "10": "I thought I would live a full life.

You took my sins and threw them away.", "18": "The dead cannot praise you. People in Sheol cannot sing praises to you.

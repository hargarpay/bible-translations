When Ahaz was king of Judah, Rezin and Pekah went up to Jerusalem to attack it, but they were not able to defeat the city.[b]", "2": "The family of David received a message that said, \u201cThe armies of Aram and Ephraim have joined together in one camp.\u201d When King Ahaz heard this message, he and the people became frightened. They shook with fear like trees of the forest blowing in the wind.", "3": "Then the Lord told Isaiah, \u201cYou and your son Shear Jashub[c] should go out and talk to Ahaz. Go to the place where the water flows into the Upper Pool,[d] on the street that leads up to Laundryman's Field.", "4": "\u201cTell Ahaz, 'Be careful, but be calm. Don't be afraid. Don't let those two men, Rezin and Remaliah's son,[e] frighten you! They are like two burning sticks. They might be hot now, but soon they will be nothing but smoke.

Then we will make Tabeel's son the new king of Judah.\u201d'\u201d", "7": "But the Lord God says, \u201cTheir plan will not succeed. It will not happen", "8": "because Aram depends on its capital Damascus, and Damascus is led by its weak king Rezin. And don't worry about Ephraim. Within 65 years it will be crushed, no longer a nation.", "9": "Ephraim depends on its capital Samaria, and Samaria is led by Remaliah's son. So you have no reason to fear. Believe this, or you will not survive.\u201d", "10": "Then the Lord spoke to Ahaz again", "11": "and said, \u201cAsk for a sign from the Lord your God to prove to yourself that this is true. You can ask for any sign you want. The sign can come from a place as deep as Sheol[f] or as high as the skies.[g]\u201d", "12": "But Ahaz said, \u201cI will not ask for a sign as proof. I will not test the Lord.\u201d", "13": "Then Isaiah said, \u201cFamily of David, listen very carefully! Is it not enough that you would test the patience of humans?

These troubles will be worse than anything that has happened since the time Israel separated from Judah. This will happen to your people and to your father's family when God brings the king of Assyria to fight against you.", "18": "\u201cAt that time the Lord will call for the 'Fly' that is now near the streams of Egypt, and he will call for the 'Bee' that is now in the country of Assyria.

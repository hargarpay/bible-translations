I, the Lord, have punished you twice for every sin you committed.\u201d", "3": "Listen, there is someone shouting: \u201cPrepare a way in the desert for the Lord. Make a straight road there for our God.", "4": "Every valley must be filled. Every mountain and hill should be made flat. The crooked roads should be made straight, and the rough ground made smooth.", "5": "Then the Glory of the Lord will be shown to everyone. Together, all people will see it. Yes, this is what the Lord himself said!\u201d", "6": "A voice said, \u201cSpeak!\u201d So the man said, \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d The voice said, \u201cPeople are like grass.

He holds them close, while their mothers walk beside him.", "12": "Who measured the oceans in the palm of his hand? Who used his hand to measure the sky? Who used a bowl to measure all the dust of the earth? Who used scales to measure the mountains and hills?", "13": "Who could know the Lord's mind? Who could be his teacher or give him advice?", "14": "Did the Lord ask for anyone's help? Did anyone teach him to be fair? Did anyone teach him knowledge?

Compared to him, they are worth nothing at all.", "18": "Can you compare God to anything? Can you make a picture of God?", "19": "No, but some people make statues from rock or wood, and they call them gods. One worker makes a statue. Then another worker covers it with gold and makes silver chains for it.", "20": "For the base he chooses special wood, a kind of wood that will not rot. Then he finds a good wood worker, and the worker makes a \u201cgod\u201d that will not fall over.", "21": "Surely you know the truth, don't you? Surely you have heard. Surely someone told you long ago. Surely you understand who made the earth.", "22": "It is the Lord who sits above the circle of the earth. And compared to him, people are like grasshoppers.

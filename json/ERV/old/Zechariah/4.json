I was like a person waking up from sleep.", "2": "Then the angel asked me, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d I said, \u201cI see a solid gold lampstand. There are seven lamps[a] on the lampstand, and there is a bowl on top of it. There are seven tubes coming from the bowl. One tube goes to each lamp. The tubes bring the oil in the bowl to each of the lamps.", "3": "There are two olive trees by the bowl, one on the right side and one on the left side. These trees produce the oil for the lamps.\u201d", "4": "Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, \u201cSir, what do these things mean?\u201d", "5": "The angel speaking with me said, \u201cDon't you know what these things are?\u201d \u201cNo sir,\u201d I said.", "6": "He said, \u201cThis is the message from the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Your help will not come from your own strength and power. No, your help will come from my Spirit.' This is what the Lord All-Powerful says.", "7": "That tall mountain will be like a flat place for Zerubbabel.

Then you will know that the Lord All-Powerful sent me to you people.", "10": "People will not be ashamed of the small beginnings, and they will be very happy when they see Zerubbabel with the plumb line,[b] measuring and checking the finished building. Now the seven sides[c] of the stone you saw represent the eyes of the Lord looking in every direction. They see everything on earth.\u201d", "11": "Then I said to him, \u201cI saw one olive tree on the right side of the lampstand and one on the left side. What do those two olive trees mean?\u201d", "12": "I also said to him, \u201cI saw two olive branches by the gold tubes with gold colored oil flowing from them.

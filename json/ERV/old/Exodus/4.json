Moses ran from it,", "4": "but the Lord said to him, \u201cReach out and grab the snake by its tail.\u201d When Moses reached out and caught the snake's tail, the snake became a walking stick again.", "5": "Then God said, \u201cUse your stick in this way, and the people will believe that you saw the Lord, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\u201d", "6": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cI will give you another proof.

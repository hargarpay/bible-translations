They said, \u201cGive us water to drink.\u201d Moses said to them, \u201cWhy have you turned against me? Why are you testing the Lord?\u201d", "3": "But the people were very thirsty, so they continued complaining to Moses. They said, \u201cWhy did you bring us out of Egypt? Did you bring us out here so that we, our children, and our cattle will all die without water?\u201d", "4": "So Moses cried to the Lord, \u201cWhat can I do with these people? They are ready to kill me.\u201d", "5": "The Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo before the Israelites. Take some of the elders of the people with you. Carry your walking stick with you. This is the stick that you used when you hit the Nile River.", "6": "I will stand before you on a rock at Horeb.[b] Hit that rock with the walking stick and water will come out of it. Then the people can drink.\u201d Moses did these things and the elders of Israel saw it.", "7": "Moses named that place Meribah[c] and Massah,[d] because this was the place that the Israelites turned against him and tested the Lord.

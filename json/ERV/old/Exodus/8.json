They will be in the houses of your officials and in your ovens and in your jars of water.", "4": "The frogs will be all over you, your people, and your officials.'\u201d", "5": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cTell Aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the canals, rivers, and lakes. Then the frogs will come out onto the land of Egypt.\u201d", "6": "So Aaron raised his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs began coming out of the water and covered the land of Egypt.", "7": "The magicians used their magic to do the same thing\u2014so even more frogs came out onto the land in Egypt!", "8": "Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, \u201cAsk the Lord to remove the frogs from me and my people. I will let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.\u201d", "9": "Moses said to Pharaoh, \u201cI will pray for you, your people, and your officials.

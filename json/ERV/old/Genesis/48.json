{"1": "Some time later Joseph learned that his father was very sick. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to his father.", "2": "When Joseph arrived, someone told Israel, \u201cYour son Joseph has come to see you.\u201d Israel was very weak, but he tried hard and sat up in his bed.", "3": "Then Israel said to Joseph, \u201cGod All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan. God blessed me there.", "4": "He said to me, 'I will make you a great family. I will give you many children and you will be a great people. Your family will own this land forever.'", "5": "Now you have two sons. These two sons were born here in the country of Egypt before I came. Your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, will be like my own sons. They will be like Reuben and Simeon to me.", "6": "So these two boys will be my sons. They will share in everything I own. But if you have other sons, they will be your sons.

Israel said, \u201cWho are these boys?\u201d", "9": "Joseph said to his father, \u201cThese are my sons. These are the boys God gave me.\u201d Israel said, \u201cBring your sons to me. I will bless them.\u201d", "10": "Israel was old and his eyes were not good. So Joseph brought the boys close to his father. Israel kissed and hugged the boys.", "11": "Then Israel said to Joseph, \u201cI never thought I would see your face again. But look! God has let me see you and your children.\u201d", "12": "Then Joseph took the boys off Israel's lap, and they bowed down in front of his father.", "13": "Joseph put Ephraim on his right side and Manasseh on his left side. (So Ephraim was on Israel's left side, and Manasseh was on Israel's right side.)", "14": "But Israel crossed his hands and put his right hand on the head of the younger boy Ephraim. Then he put his left hand on Manasseh, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.", "15": "And Israel blessed Joseph and said, \u201cMy ancestors, Abraham and Isaac, worshiped our God, and that God has led me all my life.", "16": "He was the Angel who saved me from all my troubles.

I pray that they will grow to become great families and nations on earth.\u201d", "17": "Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on Ephraim's head. This didn't make Joseph happy.

They will say, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'\u201d In this way Israel made Ephraim greater than Manasseh.", "21": "Then Israel said to Joseph, \u201cLook, my time to die is almost here, but God will still be with you. He will lead you back to the land of your ancestors.", "22": "I have given you one portion more than I gave to your brothers. I gave you the land that I won from the Amorites. I used my sword and bow to take that land.\u201d"}

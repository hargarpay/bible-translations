You will not have a home in this land.

Now I must wander from place to place, and anyone I meet could kill me.\u201d", "15": "Then the Lord said to Cain, \u201cNo, if anyone kills you, I will punish that person much, much more.\u201d Then the Lord put a mark on Cain to show that no one should kill him.", "16": "Cain went away from the Lord and lived in the land of Nod.[f]", "17": "Cain had sexual relations with his wife.

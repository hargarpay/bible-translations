There were two sisters, daughters of the same mother.", "3": "They became prostitutes in Egypt while they were still young girls. That's where they first let men touch and handle their young breasts.", "4": "The older daughter was named Oholah,[b] and her sister was named Oholibah.[c] They became my wives, and we had children. I am using the name Oholah to mean Samaria and the name Oholibah to mean Jerusalem.", "5": "\u201cThen Oholah became unfaithful to me\u2014she began to live like a prostitute. She began to want her lovers. She saw the Assyrian soldiers", "6": "in their blue uniforms. They were all handsome young men riding horses.

She became filthy with their filthy idols.", "8": "Besides that, she never stopped her love affair with Egypt. Egypt made love to her when she was a young girl. Egypt was the first lover to touch her young breasts. Egypt poured his untrue love on her.", "9": "So I let her lovers have her. She wanted Assyria, so I gave her to them!", "10": "They raped[d] her. They took her children and killed her. They punished her, and women still talk about her.", "11": "\u201cHer younger sister Oholibah saw all these things happen.

You did those bad things when you began to worship their filthy idols.", "31": "You followed your sister and lived as she did. You, yourself, took her cup of poison and held it in your hands.[e]\u201d", "32": "This is what the Lord God says: \u201cYou will drink your sister's cup of poison. It is a tall, wide cup of poison. It holds much poison. People will laugh at you and make fun of you.", "33": "You will stagger like a drunk. You will become very dizzy. That is the cup of destruction and devastation. It is like the cup of punishment that your sister drank.", "34": "You will drink the poison in that cup. You will drink it to the last drop. You will throw down the glass and break it to pieces. You will tear at your breasts from the pain. This will happen because I am the Lord God, and this is what I said.", "35": "\u201cSo this is what the Lord God said: 'Jerusalem, you forgot me.

Then tell them about the terrible things they have done.", "37": "They committed the sin of adultery. They are guilty of murder. They acted like prostitutes\u2014they left me to be with their filthy idols. They had my children, but they forced them to pass through fire. They did this to give food to their filthy idols.", "38": "They also treated my special days of rest and my holy place as though they were not important.", "39": "They killed their children for their idols, and then they went into my holy place and made it filthy too! They did this inside my Temple!", "40": "\u201cThey have sent for men from faraway places. You sent a messenger to these men, and they came to see you. You bathed for them, painted your eyes, and put on your jewelry.", "41": "You sat on a fine bed with a table set before it. You put my incense[f] and my oil[g] on this table.", "42": "\u201cThe noise in Jerusalem sounded like a crowd of people having a party.[h] Many people came to the party. People were already drinking as they came in from the desert. They gave bracelets and beautiful crowns to the women.", "43": "Then I spoke to one of the women who was worn out from her sexual sins. I asked her, 'Will they continue to do sexual sins with her, and she with them?'", "44": "But they kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute. Yes, they went again and again to Oholah and Oholibah, those wicked women.", "45": "\u201cBut good men will judge them guilty of adultery and murder, because Oholah and Oholibah committed adultery and their hands are covered with blood!\u201d", "46": "This is what the Lord God said: \u201cGather the people together to punish and terrorize Oholah and Oholibah.", "47": "They will throw stones at these women and kill them.

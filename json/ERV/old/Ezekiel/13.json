Tell them this: 'Listen to this message from the Lord!", "3": "This is what the Lord God says. Bad things will happen to you foolish prophets. You are following your own spirits. You are not telling people what you really see in visions.", "4": "\u201c'Israel, your prophets are false prophets. They are like jackals hunting for food among the ruins of a city.", "5": "You have not put soldiers near the broken walls of the city. You have not built walls to protect the family of Israel. So when the day comes for the Lord to punish you, you will lose the war!", "6": "\u201c'Your prophets say they have seen visions. They did their magic to see what will happen next. But everything they said would happen is a lie. They claim to speak for the Lord, but the Lord did not send them. And they still think that what they said is what will happen.", "7": "\u201c'If you prophets saw visions, they were not true. And all you got from your magic was lies!

He said,", "2": "\u201cSon of man,[a] look toward Mount Seir and speak against it for me.", "3": "Say to it, 'This is what the Lord God says: \u201c'I am against you, Mount Seir! I will punish you and make you an empty wasteland.", "4": "I will destroy your cities, and you will become empty. Then you will know that I am the Lord.", "5": "\u201c'Why? Because you have always been against my people. You used your sword against Israel at the time of their trouble, at the time of their final punishment.'\u201d", "6": "So the Lord God says, \u201cBut I promise by my own life that I will let death have you.

Time after time you have insulted me, and I have heard every word.\u201d", "14": "This is what the Lord God says: \u201cAll the earth will be happy when I destroy you.", "15": "You were happy when the country of Israel was destroyed. I will treat you the same way. Mount Seir and the whole country of Edom will be destroyed. Then you will know that I am the Lord.\u201d"}

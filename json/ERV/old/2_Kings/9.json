{"1": "Elisha the prophet called one of the men from the group of prophets[a] and said to him, \u201cGet ready and take this small bottle of oil in your hand. Go to Ramoth Gilead.", "2": "When you arrive, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Then go in and make him get up from among his brothers. Take him to an inner room.", "3": "Take the small bottle of oil and pour the oil on Jehu's head. Say, 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you to be the new king over Israel.' Then open the door and run away. Don't wait!\u201d", "4": "So this young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.", "5": "When the young man arrived, he saw the captains of the army sitting. He said, \u201cCaptain, I have a message for you.\u201d Jehu asked, \u201cWhich one of us is the message for?\u201d The young man said, \u201cFor you, sir.\u201d", "6": "Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and said to him, \u201cThe Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'I am anointing you to be the new king over the Lord's people, Israel.", "7": "You must destroy the family of Ahab your king. In this way I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants, the prophets, and the deaths of all the Lord's servants who were murdered.", "8": "So all Ahab's family will die. I will not let any male child in Ahab's family live. It doesn't matter if that male child is a slave or a free person in Israel.", "9": "I will make Ahab's family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah.", "10": "The dogs will eat Jezebel in the area of Jezreel, and she will not be buried.'\u201d Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away.", "11": "Jehu went back to his king's officers. One of the officers said to Jehu, \u201cIs everything all right? Why did this crazy man come to you?\u201d Jehu answered the servants, \u201cYou know the man and the crazy things he says.\u201d", "12": "The officers said, \u201cNo, tell us the truth. What did he say?\u201d Jehu told the officers what the young prophet said. Jehu said, \u201cHe said a few things and then he said, 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you to be the new king over Israel.'\u201d", "13": "Then each officer quickly took his robe off and put it on the steps in front of Jehu. Then they blew the trumpet and made the announcement, \u201cJehu is king!\u201d", "14": "So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, made plans against Joram. At that time Joram and the Israelites had been trying to defend Ramoth Gilead from King Hazael of Aram.", "15": "King Joram had fought against King Hazael of Aram. But the Arameans wounded King Joram, and he went to Jezreel to get well from those injuries. So Jehu told the officers, \u201cIf you agree that I am the new king, don't let anyone escape from the city to tell the news in Jezreel.\u201d", "16": "Joram was resting in Jezreel, so Jehu got in his chariot and drove to Jezreel. King Ahaziah of Judah had also come to Jezreel to see Joram.", "17": "A guard was standing on the tower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu's large group coming. He said, \u201cI see a large group of people!\u201d Joram said, \u201cSend someone on a horse to meet them. Tell this messenger to ask if they come in peace.\u201d", "18": "So the messenger rode on a horse to meet Jehu. The messenger said, \u201cKing Joram says, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d Jehu said, \u201cYou have nothing to do with peace. Come and follow me.\u201d The guard told Joram, \u201cThe messenger went to the group, but he has not come back yet.\u201d", "19": "Then Joram sent out a second messenger on a horse. This man came to Jehu's group and said, \u201cKing Joram says, 'Peace.'[b]\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cYou have nothing to do with peace. Come and follow me.\u201d", "20": "The guard told Joram, \u201cThe second messenger went to the group, but he has not come back yet. There is a man driving his chariot like a mad man. He is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi.\u201d", "21": "Joram said, \u201cGet me my chariot!\u201d So the servant got Joram's chariot. Both King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah got their chariots and drove out to meet Jehu. They met him at the property of Naboth from Jezreel.", "22": "Joram saw Jehu and asked, \u201cDo you come in peace, Jehu?\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cThere is no peace as long as your mother Jezebel does many acts of prostitution and witchcraft.\u201d", "23": "Joram turned the horses to run away. He said to Ahaziah, \u201cIt is a trick, Ahaziah!\u201d", "24": "But Jehu grabbed his bow and shot Joram in the middle of his back, through the heart. Joram fell dead in his chariot.", "25": "Jehu said to his chariot driver Bidkar, \u201cTake Joram's body up and throw it into the field of Naboth from Jezreel. Remember when you and I rode together with Joram's father Ahab, the Lord said this would happen to him.", "26": "The Lord said, 'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons. And I, the Lord, am telling you that I will punish Ahab in this field.' So take Joram's body and throw it into the field, just as the Lord said.\u201d", "27": "King Ahaziah of Judah saw this and ran away. He tried to escape through the garden house, but Jehu followed him. Jehu had said, \u201cShoot Ahaziah too!\u201d Ahaziah was wounded when he was in his chariot on the road to Gur near Ibleam. He got as far as Megiddo, but he died there.", "28": "Ahaziah's servants carried his body in the chariot to Jerusalem. They buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.", "29": "Ahaziah had become king over Judah during Joram's[c] eleventh year as king of Israel.", "30": "When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard the news. She put her makeup on and fixed her hair. Then she stood by the window and looked out.", "31": "Jehu entered the city. Jezebel said, \u201cHello, you Zimri.[d] You killed your master just as he did.\u201d", "32": "Jehu looked up at the window and said, \u201cWho is on my side? Who?\u201d Two or three eunuchs looked out at Jehu.", "33": "Jehu said, \u201cThrow Jezebel down!\u201d Then the eunuchs threw her down. Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses that trampled her body.", "34": "Jehu went into the house and ate and drank. Then he said, \u201cNow see about this cursed woman. Bury her, because she is a king's daughter.\u201d", "35": "The men went to bury Jezebel, but they could not find her body. They could only find her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.", "36": "When the men came back and told Jehu, he said, \u201cThe Lord told his servant Elijah the Tishbite to give this message: 'Dogs will eat the body of Jezebel in the area of Jezreel.", "37": "Her body will be like dung on the field in the area of Jezreel. No one will be able to recognize her body!'\u201d"}

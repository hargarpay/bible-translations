{"1": "Then I said, \u201cListen, leaders of Jacob and officers of the nation[a] of Israel! You should know what justice is.", "2": "But you hate good and love evil. You tear the skin off the people and tear the flesh off their bones.", "3": "You are destroying my people.[b] You take their skin off them and break their bones. You chop their bones up like meat to put in the pot!", "4": "Then you will pray to the Lord, but he will not answer you. No, he will hide his face from you, because what you do is evil.\u201d", "5": "Some false prophets are telling lies to the Lord's people. This is what the Lord says about them: \u201cThese prophets are led by their stomachs. They promise peace for those who give them food, but they promise war to those who do not give them food.", "6": "\u201cThis is why it is like night for you and you don't have visions. You cannot see what will happen in the future, so it is like darkness to you. The sun has gone down on the prophets. They cannot see what will happen in the future, so it is like darkness to them.", "7": "The seers are ashamed. The fortunetellers are embarrassed. None of them will say anything, because God will not speak to them.\u201d", "8": "But the Lord's Spirit has filled me with power, goodness, and strength. So I can tell Jacob about his crimes, and so I can tell Israel about his sins!", "9": "Leaders of Jacob and rulers of Israel, listen to me! You hate the right way of living! If something is straight, then you make it crooked!", "10": "You build Zion by murdering people.[c] You build Jerusalem by cheating people!", "11": "The judges in Jerusalem accept bribes to help them decide who wins in court. The priests in Jerusalem must be paid before they will teach the people. People must pay the prophets before they will look into the future. Then those leaders expect the Lord to help them. They say, \u201cThe Lord lives here with us, so nothing bad will happen to us.\u201d", "12": "Leaders, because of you, Zion will be destroyed. It will become a plowed field. Jerusalem will become a pile of rocks. Temple Mount will be an empty hill[d] overgrown with bushes."}

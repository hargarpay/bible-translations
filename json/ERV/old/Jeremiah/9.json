I could go away from them, because they are all unfaithful to God. They have all turned against him.", "3": "\u201cThey use their tongues like a bow; lies fly from their mouths like arrows. Lies, not truth, have grown strong in this land. They go from one sin to another. They don't know me.\u201d This is what the Lord said.", "4": "\u201cWatch your neighbors! Don't trust your own brothers, because every brother is a cheat. Every neighbor talks behind your back.", "5": "Everyone lies to their neighbor. No one speaks the truth. The people of Judah have taught their tongues to lie. They sinned until they were too tired to come back.", "6": "One bad thing followed another, and lies followed lies. The people refused to know me.\u201d This is what the Lord said.", "7": "So the Lord All-Powerful says, \u201cA worker heats metal in a fire to test it and see if it is pure.

I will destroy the cities in the land of Judah, so no one will live there.\u201d", "12": "Is there a man who is wise enough to understand these things? Is there someone who has been taught by the Lord? Can anyone explain his message? Why was the land ruined?

Death has come to our children who play in the streets and to the young men who meet in the public places.\u201d", "22": "This is what you should say: \u201cThe Lord says, 'Dead bodies will lie in the fields like dung. Their bodies will lie on the ground like grain a farmer has cut. But there will be no one to gather them.'\u201d", "23": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cThe wise must not brag about their wisdom. The strong men must not brag about their strength. The rich must not brag about their money.", "24": "But if someone wants to brag, then let them brag about this: Let them brag that they learned to know me. Let them brag that they understand that I am the Lord, that I am kind and fair, and that I do good things on earth. I love this kind of bragging.\u201d This message is from the Lord.", "25": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cThe time is coming when I will punish all those who are circumcised only in the body.", "26": "I am talking about the people of the nations of Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all those who live in the desert.

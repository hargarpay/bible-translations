{"1": "For the next two years there was peace between Israel and Aram.", "2": "Then during the third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel.", "3": "Ahab asked his officials, \u201cRemember when the king of Aram took Ramoth Gilead from us? That city is ours, so why have we done nothing to get it back?\u201d", "4": "So Ahab asked King Jehoshaphat, \u201cWill you join with us to go fight the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead?\u201d Jehoshaphat answered, \u201cYes, you and I will be as one\u2014my men and my horses will be as yours.", "5": "But first let's ask the Lord for advice.\u201d", "6": "So Ahab called a meeting of the prophets. There were about 400 prophets at that time. Ahab asked the prophets, \u201cShould I go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not?\u201d The prophets answered Ahab, \u201cYes, because the Lord will let you defeat Ramoth Gilead.\u201d", "7": "But Jehoshaphat said, \u201cDoesn't the Lord have another prophet here? Let's ask him the same question.\u201d", "8": "King Ahab answered, \u201cYes, there is another prophet. His name is Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he will not say anything good about me when he speaks for the Lord. He always says things that I don't like.\u201d Jehoshaphat said, \u201cThe king should not say that!\u201d", "9": "So King Ahab told one of his officers to go and find Micaiah.", "10": "At that time the two kings were sitting on their thrones, with their royal robes on, at the judgment place near the gates of Samaria. All the prophets were standing before them, prophesying.", "11": "One of the prophets was named Zedekiah son of Kenaanah. Zedekiah made some iron horns[a] and said to Ahab, \u201cThe Lord says, 'You will use these iron horns to fight against the army of Aram. You will defeat them and destroy them.'\u201d", "12": "All the other prophets agreed with Zedekiah and said, \u201cYour army should march now to go fight against the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead. You will win the battle. The Lord will let you defeat them.\u201d", "13": "While this was happening, the officer went to find Micaiah. When he found him, the officer told him, \u201cAll the other prophets have said that the king will succeed, so you should say the same thing.\u201d", "14": "But Micaiah answered, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, I can say only what the Lord says.\u201d", "15": "Micaiah went and stood before King Ahab. The king asked him, \u201cMicaiah, should we go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not?\u201d Micaiah answered, \u201cYes, go and be successful! The Lord will let you take the city.\u201d", "16": "But Ahab answered, \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? Tell me the truth. What does the Lord say?\u201d", "17": "So Micaiah answered, \u201cI can see the army of Israel scattered all over the hills, like sheep with no one to lead them. This is what the Lord says: 'These men have no leaders. Let them go home in peace.'\u201d", "18": "Then Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cSee, I told you! This prophet never says anything good about me. He always says something bad.\u201d", "19": "But Micaiah said, \u201cListen to this message from the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne. All of heaven's army was standing around him, some on his left side and some on his right side.", "20": "The Lord said, 'Which of you will go fool Ahab into attacking the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead so that he will be killed?' The angels discussed many different plans.", "21": "Then a spirit[b] went and stood before the Lord and said, 'I will fool him!' The Lord asked, 'How will you do it?'", "22": "The spirit answered, 'I will go to Ahab's prophets and cause them to tell lies.' So the Lord said, 'Yes, that will fool Ahab. Go out and do that.'", "23": "\u201cSo that is what has happened here. The Lord made your prophets lie to you. The Lord himself decided to bring this disaster to you.\u201d", "24": "Then the prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and hit him on the face. Zedekiah said, \u201cHow is it that the Spirit of the Lord left me to speak through you?\u201d", "25": "Micaiah answered, \u201cLook, what I said will happen! And you will see it one day when you are in a secret room somewhere hiding.\u201d", "26": "Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers to arrest Micaiah. Ahab said, \u201cArrest him and take him to Amon the governor of the city and prince Joash.", "27": "Tell them to put Micaiah in prison. Give him nothing but bread and water to eat. Keep him there until I come home from the battle.\u201d", "28": "Micaiah said, \u201cListen to me, everyone! Ahab, if you come back alive from the battle, the Lord has not spoken through me.\u201d", "29": "King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to fight the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead.", "30": "Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cDisguise yourself when you go into battle, but wear your own clothes. And I will disguise myself.\u201d The king of Israel went into battle dressed like an ordinary soldier.", "31": "The king of Aram had 32 chariot commanders. He gave them this command, \u201cDon't go after anyone except the king of Israel, no matter how important they are.\u201d", "32": "When the commanders saw King Jehoshaphat, they thought he was the king of Israel, and so they went to kill him. Jehoshaphat started shouting.", "33": "When the commanders saw that he was not King Ahab, they stopped chasing him.", "34": "Then a soldier in the distance pulled back as far as he could on his bow and shot an arrow into the air. The arrow happened to hit the king of Israel in a small hole where his armor was fastened together. King Ahab said to his chariot driver, \u201cI've been hit! Turn the chariot around and take me off the battlefield!\u201d", "35": "The armies continued to fight while King Ahab was propped up in his chariot. He was leaning against the sides of the chariot, looking out toward the Arameans. His blood ran down onto the floor of the chariot. Later in the evening, he died.", "36": "At sunset all the Israelites cheered when they were told to go home. So they all went back to their hometowns.", "37": "And that is how King Ahab died. Some men carried his body to Samaria and buried him there.", "38": "They took his chariot to the large pool in Samaria to clean it. The dogs licked up Ahab's blood while the prostitutes washed the chariot. This happened just as the Lord said it would.", "39": "The rest of what King Ahab did during the time he ruled is written in the book, The History of the Kings of Israel. That book tells about all the cities he built and about all the ivory that he used to decorate his palace.", "40": "Ahab died and was buried with his ancestors. His son Ahaziah became the next king after him.", "41": "Jehoshaphat son of Asa became the king of Judah in Ahab's fourth year as king of Israel.", "42": "Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.", "43": "Like his father Asa, Jehoshaphat was good and did everything that the Lord wanted, but he did not destroy the high places. The people continued offering sacrifices and burning incense there.", "44": "Jehoshaphat made a peace agreement with the king of Israel.", "45": "Jehoshaphat was very brave and fought many wars. The rest of what he did is written in the book, The History of the Kings of Judah.", "46": "Jehoshaphat forced all the men and women who sold their bodies for sex to leave the places of worship. They had served in these places of worship while his father Asa was king.", "47": "In those days Edom did not have a king; it was ruled by a governor who was chosen by the king of Judah.", "48": "King Jehoshaphat built some cargo ships. He wanted the ships to sail to Ophir for gold, but they never went there\u2014they were destroyed in their home port at Ezion Geber.", "49": "Then King Ahaziah of Israel offered to put some of his own sailors with Jehoshaphat's men on the ships,[c] but Jehoshaphat refused to accept his help.", "50": "Jehoshaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king.", "51": "Ahaziah was the son of Ahab. He became king of Israel during the 17th year that King Jehoshaphat ruled Judah. Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years.", "52": "He sinned against the Lord just as his parents, Ahab and Jezebel, did. He caused Israel to sin just as Jeroboam son of Nebat did.", "53": "Ahaziah served the false god Baal and worshiped him, just as his father did before him. He did all the things that his father did to make the Lord, the God of Israel, angry."}

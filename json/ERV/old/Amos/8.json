I will not ignore their sins anymore.", "3": "Their temple songs will become funeral songs.\u201d This is what the Lord God said. \u201cThere will be dead bodies everywhere. In silence, people will take out the dead bodies and throw them onto the pile.[b]\u201d", "4": "Listen to me, you who trample on helpless people. You are trying to destroy the poor of this country.", "5": "You merchants say, \u201cWhen will the New Moon be over so that we can sell grain? When will the Sabbath be over so that we can bring out more wheat to sell? We can raise the price and make the measure smaller.[c] We can fix the scales and cheat the people.[d]", "6": "The poor cannot pay their loans, so we will buy them as slaves.

This message is about all the families that I brought from the land of Egypt.", "2": "\u201cThere are many families on earth, but you are the only family I chose to know in a special way. And you turned against me, so I will punish you for all your sins.\u201d", "3": "Two people will not walk together unless they have agreed to do so.", "4": "A lion will roar in the forest only if it catches its prey. A young lion roaring in his cave means he has caught something to eat.", "5": "A bird doesn't fly into a trap unless there is food in it. If a trap closes, it will catch the bird.", "6": "If people hear the warning blast of a trumpet, they shake with fear.

Those who live in Samaria will save only a corner from a bed, or a piece of cloth from a couch.\u201d", "13": "This is what the Lord God All-Powerful says: \u201cWarn the family of Jacob about these things.", "14": "Israel sinned, and I will punish them for their sins.

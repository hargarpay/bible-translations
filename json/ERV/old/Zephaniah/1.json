I will remove all people from the earth.\u201d This is what the Lord said.", "4": "\u201cI will punish Judah and the people living in Jerusalem. I will remove from this place any signs of Baal worship. No one will remember the priests who serve the idols there.", "5": "And those who go up on their roofs to worship the stars[b] will be forgotten. They worship me, the Lord, but they also use the name of the false god Milcom to make promises.", "6": "They have turned away from me, the Lord. They have stopped following me. They no longer ask me, the Lord, for help.\u201d", "7": "Be silent before the Lord God, because the Lord's day for judging the people is coming soon. The Lord has prepared his sacrifice, and he has told his invited guests to get ready.[c]", "8": "The Lord said, \u201cOn the Lord's day of sacrifice, I will punish the king's sons and other leaders. I will punish all the people wearing clothes from other countries.", "9": "At that time I will punish all the people who jump over the threshold[d] and those who fill their master's house[e] with lies and violence.\u201d", "10": "The Lord also said, \u201cAt that time people will be calling for help at Fish Gate in Jerusalem and mourning in the new part of town.

{"1": "And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of [a]speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the [b]testimony of God. ", "2": "For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. ", "3": "And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. ", "4": "And my [c]speech and my [d]preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: ", "5": "that your faith should not [e]stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.", "6": "We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this [f]world, nor of the rulers of this [g]world, who are coming to nought: ", "7": "but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the [h]worlds unto our glory: ", "8": "which none of the rulers of this [i]world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory: ", "9": "but as it is written, [j]Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.", "10": "[k]But unto us God revealed [l]them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

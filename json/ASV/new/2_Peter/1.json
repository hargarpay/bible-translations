{"1": "[a]Simon Peter, a [b]servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained [c]a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of [d]our God and the Saviour Jesus Christ: ", "2": "Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; ", "3": "seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us [e]by his own glory and virtue; ", "4": "whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of [f]the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. ", "5": "Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge; ", "6": "and in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control [g]patience; and in your [h]patience godliness; ", "7": "and in your godliness [i]brotherly kindness; and in your [j]brotherly kindness love. ", "8": "For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. ", "9": "For he that lacketh these things is blind, [k]seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins. ", "10": "Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble: ", "11": "for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.", "12": "Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with you. ", "13": "And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; ", "14": "knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me. ", "15": "Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my [l]decease to call these things to remembrance. ", "16": "For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and [m]coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. ", "17": "For he [n]received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: ", "18": "and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount. ", "19": "And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a [o]dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: ", "20": "knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of [p]private interpretation. ", "21": "For no prophecy ever [q]came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit."}

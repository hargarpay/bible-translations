{"1": "Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy [a]tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?", "2": "He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;", "3": "[b]He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;", "4": "In [c]whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But [d]who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; [e]He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;", "5": "[f]He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved."}

{"1": "I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my [a]spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, [b]O beloved.", "2": "I [c]was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my [d]undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.", "3": "I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?", "4": "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, And my [e]heart was moved for him.", "5": "I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt.", "6": "I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had [f]withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul [g]had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.", "7": "The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my [h]mantle from me.", "8": "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, [i]That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.", "9": "What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thou dost so adjure us?", "10": "My beloved is white and ruddy, [j]The chiefest among ten thousand.", "11": "His head is as the most fine gold; His locks are [k]bushy, and black as a raven.", "12": "His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, and [l]fitly set.", "13": "His cheeks are as a bed of [m]spices, As [n]banks of sweet herbs: His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.", "14": "His hands are as [o]rings of gold set with [p]beryl: His body is as [q]ivory work [r]overlaid with sapphires.", "15": "His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.", "16": "His [s]mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."}

For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.", "3": "This is my defense to those who examine me. ", "4": "Do we not have a right to eat and to drink? ", "5": "Do we not have a right to take along a wife who is a believer, as the rest of the apostles do, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?[a] ", "6": "Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who have no right to be spared from manual labor? ", "7": "What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat some of its fruit? Or who takes care of a flock and does not drink milk from the flock? ", "8": "Am I saying this just from a human point of view? Doesn't the law also say this?

But we did not use this right. Instead, we endure everything so as not to cause any hindrance for the gospel of Christ.", "13": "Do you not know that those who do the work in the temple eat food from the temple, and those who attend to the altar receive a portion from what is on the altar? ", "14": "In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel are to receive their living from the gospel. ", "15": "But I have used none of these things. I am not writing this to have it done this way in my case, because it is better for me to die than to let anyone deprive me of my boast. ", "16": "You see, if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, because an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!

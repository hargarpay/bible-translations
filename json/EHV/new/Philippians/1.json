", "4": "Every time I pray for all of you, I always pray with joy, ", "5": "because of your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now. ", "6": "I am convinced of this very thing: that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. ", "7": "I am equally convinced that it is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart, for both in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all share in this grace with me. ", "8": "Yes, God is my witness of how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.", "9": "And I pray that your love may still increase more and more in knowledge and every insight.

", "13": "And so it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to all the rest, that I am in chains because of Christ.[b] ", "14": "And, through my chains, the majority of the brothers in the Lord have become much more confident about daring to speak the word of God[c] fearlessly. ", "15": "Some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, and others out of good will. ", "16": "The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel. ", "17": "The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, but thinking they can cause trouble for me while I am in chains. ", "18": "What does it matter? Only this, that in every way, whether for outward appearance or for the truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice.

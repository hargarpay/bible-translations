", "3": "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty conceit, but in humility consider one another better than yourselves. ", "4": "Let each of you look carefully not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.", "5": "Indeed,[a] let this attitude be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. ", "6": "Though he was by nature God,[b] he did not consider equality with God as a prize to be displayed,[c] ", "7": "but he emptied himself by taking the nature[d] of a servant. When he was born in human likeness, and his appearance was like that of any other man,[e] ", "8": "he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death\u2014even death on a cross. ", "9": "Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, ", "10": "so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, ", "11": "and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.", "12": "So then, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you, but also now much more in my absence, continue to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

You shine among them like lights in the world, ", "16": "as you hold on to[f] the word of life. Then I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. ", "17": "But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I continue to be glad and rejoice with you all.

", "24": "But I have confidence in the Lord that I myself will be coming soon too.", "25": "I also considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier, as well as the one you sent to serve me in my need. ", "26": "I sent him because he was longing for[h] all of you and was distressed, because you had heard that he was sick. ", "27": "As a matter of fact, he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. ", "28": "Now I am especially eager to send him, so that you may rejoice when you see him again, and I may be relieved. ", "29": "Therefore, receive him in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard, ", "30": "because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life in order to fill in what was lacking in your service to me."}

", "5": "For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so through Christ our comfort also overflows. ", "6": "If we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the ability to endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering. ", "7": "Our hope for you is sure, since we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so you also share in our comfort.", "8": "Brothers,[a] we do not want you to be unaware of the trouble that happened to us in the province of Asia. We were burdened so greatly, so far beyond our ability to bear it, that we even gave up hope of living. ", "9": "Yes, we even felt the sentence of death within ourselves. This happened so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead. ", "10": "He rescued us from such a terrible death, and he will continue to rescue us. We have set our hope on him that he will also rescue us again, ", "11": "as you join in helping us with your prayers for us. Then many people will thank God for the gracious gift given to us through many prayers.", "12": "Indeed, this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world with God-given holiness[b] and sincerity, not with the wisdom of the flesh, but rather in God's grace\u2014especially toward you. ", "13": "In fact, we are not writing you anything other than what you read or also understand. And I hope you will understand completely\u2014 ", "14": "as you have also understood us in part\u2014that on the day of our Lord Jesus we are going to be your reason for boasting, just as you are our reason.", "15": "In this confidence, I was planning to visit you first, so that you would have a second gracious gift. ", "16": "Then I planned to travel from you on to Macedonia, and to return again from Macedonia to you to receive help from you on my way to Judea. ", "17": "So when I made this plan, I did not do it lightly, did I? Or the things I plan, am I planning them the way the sinful flesh does, so that I would be saying both \u201cYes, yes\u201d and \u201cNo, no\u201d at the same time?", "18": "As surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d ", "19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us (by me, Silas,[c] and Timothy), was not \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d but in him the \u201cYes\u201d stands firm. ", "20": "In fact, as many promises as God has made, they have always been \u201cYes\u201d in him.

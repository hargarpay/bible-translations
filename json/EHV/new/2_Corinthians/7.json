We have wronged no one. We have corrupted no one. We have taken advantage of no one. ", "3": "I am not saying this to condemn you. In fact, I have said before that you are in our hearts\u2014we died together and live together with you! ", "4": "I have great confidence in you. I am very proud of you. I am filled with encouragement. I am overflowing with joy in all our trouble.", "5": "In fact, when we came to Macedonia, our flesh had no relief. Instead, we were troubled in every way\u2014conflicts on the outside, fears on the inside.

In addition to our comfort, we rejoiced a great deal more at the joy of Titus, because all of you have set his spirit at rest.

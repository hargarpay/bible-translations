{"1": "Therefore, since we have this ministry as a result of the mercy shown us, we are not discouraged. ", "2": "On the contrary, we have renounced shameful, underhanded methods. We do not operate in a deceitful way, and we do not distort the word of God. Instead, by proclaiming the truth clearly, we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.", "3": "But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing. ", "4": "In the case of those people, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from clearly seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is God's image.", "5": "Indeed, we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. ", "6": "For the God who said, \u201cLight will shine out of darkness,\u201d[a] is the same one who made light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the person[b] of Jesus Christ.", "7": "We hold this treasure in clay jars to show that its extraordinary power is from God and not from us.

", "10": "We always carry around in our body the death of the Lord Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.

", "12": "So then, death is working in us, but life is working in you.", "13": "Since we have that same spirit of faith, which corresponds to what is written: \u201cI believed; therefore, I have spoken,\u201d[c] we also believe, and therefore we speak. ", "14": "For we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and bring us (together with you) into his presence. ", "15": "In fact, all this is for your benefit, so that as grace increases, it will overflow to the glory of God, as more and more people give thanks.", "16": "Therefore we are not discouraged. But even if our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day. ", "17": "Yes, our momentary, light trouble produces for us an eternal weight of glory that is far beyond any comparison. ", "18": "We are not focusing on what is seen, but on what is not seen. For the things that are seen are temporary, but the things that are not seen are eternal."}

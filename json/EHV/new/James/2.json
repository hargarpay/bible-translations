{"1": "My brothers, have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ without showing favoritism. ", "2": "For example, suppose a man enters your worship assembly[a] wearing gold rings and fine clothing, and a poor man also enters wearing filthy clothing. ", "3": "If you look with favor on the man wearing fine clothing and say, \u201cSit here in this good place,\u201d but you tell the poor man, \u201cStand over there\u201d or \u201cSit down here[b] at my feet,\u201d ", "4": "have you not made a distinction among yourselves and become judges with evil opinions? ", "5": "Listen, my dear brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to those who love him? ", "6": "But you dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you, and don't they drag you into court? ", "7": "Aren't they the ones who blaspheme the noble name that was pronounced over you? ", "8": "However, if you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture: \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself,\u201d[c] you are doing well.

", "11": "For the one who said, \u201cDo not commit adultery,\u201d[d] also said, \u201cDo not commit murder.\u201d[e] Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.

Mercy triumphs[f] over judgment.", "14": "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says that he has faith but has no works? Such \u201cfaith\u201d cannot save him, can it?

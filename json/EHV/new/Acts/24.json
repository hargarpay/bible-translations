", "3": "In every way and in every place, we acknowledge this with all gratitude. ", "4": "But in order not to detain you any longer, I beg you in your kindness to give us a brief hearing. ", "5": "For we have found this man to be a public menace, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.

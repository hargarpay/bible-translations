", "5": "Through him we received grace and the call to be an apostle on behalf of his name, to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, ", "6": "including you, who were called by Jesus Christ.", "7": "To all those loved by God who are in Rome, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.", "8": "First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. ", "9": "To be sure, God, whom I serve with my spirit by proclaiming the gospel of his Son, is my witness to how constantly I make mention of you.

", "17": "For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed by faith, for faith,[e] just as it is written, \u201cThe righteous will live by faith.\u201d[f]", "18": "Indeed, God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who try to suppress the truth by unrighteousness. ", "19": "This happens because what can be known about God is evident among them, because God made it evident among them. ", "20": "In fact, his invisible characteristics\u2014his eternal power and divine nature\u2014have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, because they are understood from the things he made. As a result, people are without excuse, ", "21": "because, even though they knew God, they did not honor him or give him thanks as God.

They are gossipers, ", "30": "slanderers, God-haters, insolent mockers, arrogant boasters, and loudmouths. They dream up evil things. They disobey their parents.

Indeed, above all else, they were entrusted with the messages of God.", "3": "Now what if some did not believe? Their unbelief[a] will not nullify God's faithfulness, will it? ", "4": "Absolutely not! God must be true, even though everyone is found to be a liar, just as it is written: So that you would be justified whenever you speak, and win the case when you judge.[b]", "5": "Now if our unrighteousness demonstrates God's righteousness, what shall we say? God is not unjust in bringing his wrath on us, is he? (I am speaking from a human point of view.) ", "6": "Absolutely not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? ", "7": "For example,[c] someone might say, \u201cIf by my lie the truth of God increases all the more to his glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?\u201d ", "8": "And why not say (as some slanderously claim we say), \u201cLet us do evil so that good may result.\u201d Their condemnation is deserved.", "9": "What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all! In fact, we have already made the charge that all (both Jews and Greeks) are under sin.

There is no one who searches for God.", "12": "They all turned away; together they became useless.

{"1": "What shall we say then? Shall we keep on sinning so that grace may increase? ", "2": "Absolutely not! We died to sin. How can we go on living in it any longer? ", "3": "Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? ", "4": "We were therefore buried with him by this baptism into his death, so that just as he was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too would also walk in a new life.", "5": "For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection.", "6": "We know that our old self was crucified with him, to make our sinful body powerless, so that we would not continue to serve sin. ", "7": "For the person who has died has been declared free from sin. ", "8": "And since we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. ", "9": "We know that since Christ has been raised from the dead, he will never die again. Death no longer has control over him. ", "10": "For the death he died, he died to sin once and for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God. ", "11": "In the same way also consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.[a]", "12": "Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires. ", "13": "Do not offer the members of your body to sin as tools of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and offer the members of your body to God as tools of righteousness. ", "14": "Indeed, sin will not continue to control you, because you are not under law but under grace.", "15": "What then? Should we continue to sin, because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not! ", "16": "Do you not know that when you offer yourselves to obey someone as slaves, you are slaves of the one you are obeying\u2014whether slaves of sin, resulting in death, or slaves of obedience, resulting in righteousness?", "17": "Thanks be to God that, although you used to be slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to the pattern of the teaching into which you were placed. ", "18": "After you were set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. ", "19": "(I am speaking in a human way because of the weakness of your flesh.) Indeed, just as you offered your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness, resulting in more lawlessness, so now offer your members in the same way as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.", "20": "For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness. ", "21": "So what kind of fruit did you have then? They were things of which you are now ashamed. Yes, the final result of those things is death. ", "22": "But now, since you were set free from sin and have become slaves to God, you have your fruit resulting in sanctification\u2014and the final result is eternal life. ", "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the undeserved gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."}

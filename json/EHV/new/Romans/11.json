{"1": "So I say, did God reject his people? Absolutely not! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin. ", "2": "God did not reject his people whom he foreknew\u2014or don't you know what Scripture says about Elijah, how he was pleading with God against Israel: ", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life.\u201d[a] ", "4": "But what did God's answer tell him? \u201cI have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\u201d[b]", "5": "So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.[c] ", "6": "Now if it is by grace, then it is not the result of works\u2014otherwise grace would no longer be grace.[d]", "7": "What then? Israel did not receive what it was striving to get. The elect did, but the rest were hardened. ", "8": "Just as it is written: God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, right up to the present day.[e]", "9": "And David says: Let their table be a trap and a net, and a snare and a retribution for them.", "10": "Let their eyes be darkened so they do not see, and let their backs be always bent.[f]", "11": "So I ask, \u201cDid they stumble in order to fall permanently?\u201d Absolutely not! Rather, by their trespass, salvation came to the Gentiles to make the Israelites jealous. ", "12": "Now if their trespass meant riches for the world, and their failure meant riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean!", "13": "I am speaking to you Gentiles. For as long as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I am going to speak highly of my ministry. ", "14": "Perhaps I may make my own people jealous, and so save some of them. ", "15": "For if their rejection meant the reconciliation of the world, what does their acceptance mean other than the dead coming to life?", "16": "If the part offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches. ", "17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you\u2014a wild olive branch\u2014were grafted in among them and share in the rich sap from the root of the olive tree, ", "18": "do not boast that you are better than the branches. If you do boast, remember that you are not supporting the root, but the root is supporting you. ", "19": "Then you will say: \u201cBranches were broken off so that I am grafted in.\u201d ", "20": "That is true\u2014but remember that they were broken off because of unbelief, and you remain in place by faith. Do not be conceited, but stand in awe. ", "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you. ", "22": "So take note of God's kindness and his severity: severity on those who have fallen, but God's kindness on you\u2014if you remain in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be cut off.", "23": "And if they do not remain in unbelief, those branches will be grafted in again, because God is able to graft them in again. ", "24": "For if you were cut off from a wild olive tree and, contrary to nature, were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more easily will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?", "25": "For I do not want you to be uninformed about this mystery, brothers, so that you are not conceited in your opinion of yourselves. There has been a hardening of part of Israel until the full number of Gentiles has come in. ", "26": "And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written: The Deliverer will come out of Zion; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.", "27": "And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.[g]", "28": "In regard to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But, in regard to election, they are especially dear for the sake of the patriarchs, ", "29": "because God's gracious gifts and call are not regretted. ", "30": "For just as you were once disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy due to their disobedience, ", "31": "so also now they have become disobedient, so that by the mercy shown to you they may be shown mercy too. ", "32": "For God imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may show mercy to all.", "33": "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how untraceable his ways!", "34": "\u201cFor who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his adviser?\u201d[h]", "35": "\u201cOr who has first given to God that he will be repaid?\u201d[i]", "36": "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen."}

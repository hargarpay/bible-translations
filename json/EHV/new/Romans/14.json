And he will stand, because God[a] is able to make him stand.", "5": "One person values one day above another. Another person values every day the same. Let each person be fully convinced in his own mind. ", "6": "The person who honors a certain day does this for the Lord, and the person who eats does this for the Lord, because he gives thanks to God. And the person who does not eat does this for the Lord and gives thanks to God.", "7": "In fact, not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself. ", "8": "Indeed, if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.

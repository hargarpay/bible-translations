", "4": "He got up from the supper and laid aside his outer garment. He took a towel and tied it around his waist. ", "5": "Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.", "6": "He came to Simon Peter, who asked him, \u201cLord, are you going to wash my feet?\u201d", "7": "Jesus answered him, \u201cYou do not understand what I am doing now, but later you will understand.\u201d", "8": "Peter told him, \u201cYou will never, ever, wash my feet!\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cIf I do not wash you, you have no part with me.\u201d", "9": "\u201cLord, not just my feet,\u201d Simon Peter replied, \u201cbut also my hands and my head!\u201d", "10": "Jesus told him, \u201cA person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet, but his body is completely clean. And you[b] are clean, but not all of you.\u201d ", "11": "Indeed, he knew who was going to betray him.

So Jesus told him, \u201cWhat you are about to do, do more quickly.\u201d", "28": "None of those reclining at the table understood why Jesus said this to him.

And it was night.", "31": "After Judas left, Jesus said, \u201cNow the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.[d] ", "32": "If God is glorified in him,[e] God will also glorify the Son in himself and will glorify him at once.\u201d", "33": "\u201cDear children, I am going to be with you only a little longer.

{"1": "After saying these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley,[a] where there was a garden. He and his disciples went into it.", "2": "Now Judas, who was betraying him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. ", "3": "So Judas took the company of soldiers and some guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.", "4": "Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d", "5": "\u201cJesus the Nazarene,\u201d they replied. \u201cI am he,\u201d Jesus told them. Judas, the betrayer, was standing with them. ", "6": "When Jesus told them, \u201cI am he,\u201d they backed away and fell to the ground.", "7": "Then Jesus asked them again, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d \u201cJesus the Nazarene,\u201d they said.", "8": "\u201cI told you that I am he,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cSo if you are looking for me, let these men go.\u201d ", "9": "This was to fulfill the statement he had spoken: \u201cI did not lose any of those you have given me.\u201d", "10": "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.", "11": "So Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut your sword into its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup my Father has given me?\u201d", "12": "Then the company of soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus and bound him. ", "13": "First they led him to Annas, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. ", "14": "Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews, \u201cIt is better that one man die for the people.\u201d", "15": "Simon Peter and another disciple kept following Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, so he went into the high priest's courtyard with Jesus. ", "16": "But Peter stood outside by the door.

While they warmed themselves, Peter was standing with them, warming himself too.", "19": "The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.", "20": "Jesus answered him, \u201cI have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in a synagogue or at the temple, where all the Jews gather. I said nothing in secret. ", "21": "Why are you questioning me? Ask those who heard what I told them. Look, they know what I said.\u201d", "22": "When he said this, one of the guards standing there hit Jesus in the face. \u201cIs that how you answer the high priest?\u201d he demanded.", "23": "\u201cIf I said something wrong,\u201d Jesus answered, \u201ctestify about what was wrong. But if I was right, why did you hit me?\u201d", "24": "Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Simon Peter continued to stand there warming himself. So they said to him, \u201cYou are not one of his disciples too, are you?\u201d He denied it, saying, \u201cI am not!\u201d", "26": "One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \u201cDidn't I see you with him in the garden?\u201d", "27": "Peter denied it again, and just then a rooster crowed.", "28": "Early in the morning, the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. They did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so that they would not become ceremonially unclean. (They wanted to be able to eat the Passover meal.) ", "29": "So Pilate went out to them and said, \u201cWhat charge do you bring against this man?\u201d", "30": "They answered him, \u201cIf this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.\u201d", "31": "Pilate told them, \u201cTake him yourselves and judge him according to your law.\u201d The Jews said, \u201cIt's not legal for us to put anyone to death.\u201d ", "32": "This happened so that the statement Jesus had spoken indicating what kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.", "33": "Pilate went back into the Praetorium and summoned Jesus.

Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?\u201d", "36": "Jesus replied, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.\u201d", "37": "\u201cYou are a king then?\u201d Pilate asked. Jesus answered, \u201cI am, as you say, a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d", "38": "\u201cWhat is truth?\u201d Pilate said to him. After he said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, \u201cI find no basis for a charge against him. ", "39": "But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at the Passover.

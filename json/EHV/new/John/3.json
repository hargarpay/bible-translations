", "2": "He came to Jesus at night and said to him, \u201cRabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can do these miraculous signs you are doing unless God is with him.\u201d", "3": "Jesus replied, \u201cAmen, Amen, I tell you: Unless someone is born from above,[a] he cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d", "4": "Nicodemus said to him, \u201cHow can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?\u201d", "5": "Jesus answered, \u201cAmen, Amen, I tell you: Unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God!

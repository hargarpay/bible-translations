", "5": "If they do not welcome you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d", "6": "They set out and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.", "7": "Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening, and he was quite puzzled because some said that John had risen from the dead. ", "8": "Others said that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen. ", "9": "But Herod said, \u201cI beheaded John, but who is this, about whom I hear such great things?\u201d So he wanted to see him.", "10": "The apostles returned and told Jesus what they had done. He took them and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida. ", "11": "But when the crowds found out, they followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God. He also healed those who needed healing. ", "12": "As the day began to draw to a close, the Twelve came and said to him, \u201cDismiss the crowd so that they can go to the surrounding villages and farms to find lodging and food, because we are in a deserted place here.\u201d", "13": "But he said to them, \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish,\u201d they replied, \u201cunless we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ", "14": "(There were about five thousand men.)

Let's make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\u201d He did not realize what he was saying.", "34": "While he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. They were afraid as they went into the cloud. ", "35": "Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love.[d] Listen to him!\u201d ", "36": "After the voice had spoken, they found Jesus alone.

But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. ", "43": "They were all astonished at the majesty of God. While everyone was amazed at all the things Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples, ", "44": "\u201cLet these words sink into your ears[f] and remember this: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.\u201d ", "45": "But they did not understand what he was saying. It was hidden from them so they did not grasp it. And they were afraid to ask him about this statement.", "46": "An argument started among them about which of them would be the greatest. ", "47": "Since Jesus knew the thoughts of their hearts, he took a little child and had him stand next to him. ", "48": "Then he said to them, \u201cWhoever receives this little child in my name receives me. And whoever receives me receives him who sent me. In fact, the one who is least among all of you is the one who is great.\u201d", "49": "John said in reply, \u201cMaster, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he is not following you along with us.\u201d", "50": "But Jesus said to him, \u201cDo not try to stop him, because whoever is not against you is for you.\u201d", "51": "When the days were approaching for him to be taken up, Jesus was determined[g] to go to Jerusalem.

", "2": "He answered them, \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered these things? ", "3": "I tell you, no. But unless you repent, you will all perish too. ", "4": "Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think that they were worse sinners than all the people living in Jerusalem? ", "5": "I tell you, no. But unless you repent, you will all perish too.\u201d", "6": "He told them this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it, but he did not find any. ", "7": "So he said to the gardener, 'Look, for three years now I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and I have found none. Cut it down. Why even let it use up the soil?'

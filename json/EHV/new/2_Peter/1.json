", "4": "Through these he has given us his precious and great promises so that through them you may share in the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that sinful lust causes in the world.", "5": "And, for this very reason, after applying every effort, add moral excellence to your faith. To moral excellence, add knowledge. ", "6": "To knowledge, add self-control. To self-control, add patient endurance. To patient endurance, add godliness. ", "7": "To godliness, add brotherly affection. And to brotherly affection, add love. ", "8": "For if you have these qualities and they are increasing, they are going to keep you from being idle or unfruitful in regard to your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

{"1": "The main point of what we are saying is this: We have the kind of high priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven. ", "2": "He is the minister in the Holy Place, which is the true sanctuary, which the Lord set up, not man. ", "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices, and for that reason this priest also needed to have something that he offered.", "4": "If this priest were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there are priests[a] who are designated by the law to offer gifts. ", "5": "They serve at a place that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, a place exactly like that about which Moses was told when he was about to complete the tent.[b] For God said, \u201cSee to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.\u201d[c]", "6": "But now, Jesus has obtained a ministry that is as much superior as the covenant that he mediates is better, because it has been established on the basis of better promises.

I will put my laws into their mind, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.", "11": "Never again will a man teach his fellow citizen[e] or his brother, saying, \u201cKnow the Lord,\u201d because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.", "12": "For I will be merciful in regard to their unrighteousness, and I will not remember their sins any longer.[f]", "13": "When God said \u201cnew,\u201d he made the first covenant obsolete, and something that is obsolete and growing old is going to disappear."}

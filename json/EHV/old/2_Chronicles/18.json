He continually prophesies only bad things. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.\u201d Jehoshaphat said, \u201cThe king should not talk like that.\u201d", "8": "So the king of Israel summoned one of his officials and said, \u201cQuickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah here.\u201d", "9": "Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes.

I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and the whole army of heaven was standing on his right and on his left.", "19": "The Lord said, \u201cWho will entice Ahab king of Israel, so that he goes up and falls at Ramoth Gilead?\u201d One spirit said this; another one said that.

The Lord has put a lying spirit into the mouth of all your prophets, for the Lord has decreed disaster for you.", "23": "Then Zedekiah son of Kena'anah came over and struck Micaiah on his cheek and said, \u201cWhere is this pathway on which the spirit of the Lord has traveled from me to speak to you?\u201d", "24": "Micaiah said, \u201cYou will see on the day you go into the inner room to hide.\u201d", "25": "Then the king of Israel said, \u201cSeize Micaiah and take him back to Amon, the administrator of the city, and to Joash, son of the king.

The Israelites totally destroyed them and their cities. They named the place Hormah.[a]", "4": "They set out from Mount Hor along the road to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom, but the people became very impatient along the way. ", "5": "The people spoke against God and against Moses, \u201cWhy have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? Look, there is no food! There is no water! And we are disgusted by this worthless food!\u201d[b]", "6": "The Lord sent venomous[c] snakes among the people, and the snakes bit the people. As a result many people from Israel died. ", "7": "The people went to Moses and said, \u201cWe have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray to the Lord to take the snakes away from us.\u201d So Moses prayed on behalf of the people.", "8": "The Lord said to Moses, \u201cMake a venomous snake and put it on a pole. If anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.\u201d ", "9": "Moses made a bronze snake and put it on the pole. If a snake had bitten anyone, if that person looked at the bronze snake, he lived.", "10": "The Israelites set out and camped at Oboth. ", "11": "They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab, toward the sunrise. ", "12": "From there they set out and camped at the Zered Canyon. ", "13": "From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends from the Amorite border. (The Arnon is the border between Moab and the Amorites.) ", "14": "For this reason it says in the Book of the Wars of the Lord: Waheb[d] in Suphah, the ravines of the Arnon, ", "15": "the sloping ravines that bend toward the settlement of Ar and lie on the border of Moab.", "16": "From there they continued to Be'er.[e] That is the well which the Lord spoke about to Moses: \u201cGather the people together, and I will give them water.\u201d ", "17": "Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! Sing about it.", "18": "Sing about the well which the officials dug, which the nobles of the people hollowed out with their scepters and their staffs.

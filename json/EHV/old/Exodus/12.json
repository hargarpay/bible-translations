Whatever remains until the morning, you shall burn in the fire. ", "11": "This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt ready for travel,[d] your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Passover.", "12": "For on that night I will pass through the land of Egypt. I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both people and animals. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I am the Lord. ", "13": "The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. There will be no plague among you to destroy you when I strike down the land of Egypt.", "14": "This day shall be a memorial for you, and you are to celebrate it as a festival to the Lord. Throughout your generations you must celebrate it as a permanent regulation. ", "15": "For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.

When he struck the Egyptians, he spared our houses.'\u201d The people bowed down and worshipped. ", "28": "The Israelites went and did all this. They did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.", "29": "At midnight the Lord struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, even all the firstborn of the livestock.

", "31": "Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron that night and said, \u201cGet up, get away from my people! Both you and the Israelites, go, serve the Lord, as you have said! ", "32": "Take also your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go! But also bless me!\u201d", "33": "The Egyptians urged the people to leave the land quickly, for the Egyptians said, \u201cWe are all going to die!\u201d ", "34": "The Israelites took their dough before it was leavened. They carried their kneading bowls, which were wrapped in their clothing, on their shoulders. ", "35": "The Israelites did just as Moses had said, and they asked the Egyptians for articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing. ", "36": "The Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians so that they let the Israelites have what they asked for. In this way they plundered the Egyptians.", "37": "The Israelites set out from Rameses to Sukkoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides their families. ", "38": "A mixed group of non-Israelites also went up along with them, as well as a large amount of livestock, both flocks and herds. ", "39": "The Israelites baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves, for it had not been leavened, because they had been driven out of Egypt and could not delay. They also had not prepared any provisions for themselves.", "40": "The amount of time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. ", "41": "At the end of four hundred thirty years, to the very day, all of the Lord's divisions went out from the land of Egypt. ", "42": "It was a night that the Lord kept vigil to bring them out of the land of Egypt. This same night is dedicated to the Lord. All the Israelites are to keep vigil throughout their generations.", "43": "The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cThis is the regulation concerning the Passover: No foreigner may eat it. ", "44": "But any slave whom you have purchased may eat it if you circumcise him. ", "45": "A temporary resident or a hired servant may not eat it. ", "46": "It must be eaten inside one house. You are not to carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not break any of its bones. ", "47": "The whole community of Israel shall do this. ", "48": "If a resident alien among you wants to observe the Passover to the Lord, every male in his household must be circumcised. Then he may take part in it. He will be treated like a native-born of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat it.

They did just as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron. ", "51": "That same day the Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, lined up by their divisions."}

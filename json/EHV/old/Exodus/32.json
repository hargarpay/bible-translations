{"1": "When the people saw that it took so long for Moses to come down from the mountain, the people gathered around Aaron and said to him, \u201cGet up, make a god[a] for us, who will go before us, because this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt\u2014we do not know what has become of him.\u201d", "2": "Aaron said to them, \u201cPull off the gold earrings from your wives and sons and daughters and bring them to me.\u201d", "3": "All the people pulled off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.

Then they said, \u201cThis is your god, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\u201d[b]", "5": "When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of it, and Aaron made a proclamation. He said, \u201cTomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord.\u201d", "6": "They got up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought fellowship offerings. Then the people sat down to eat and to drink and got up to celebrate wildly.", "7": "The Lord spoke to Moses: \u201cHurry down, because your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves! ", "8": "They have quickly turned from the way which I commanded them. They have made a calf for themselves out of metal and have worshipped it. They have sacrificed to it and said, 'This is your god, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'\u201d", "9": "The Lord said to Moses, \u201cI have seen these people, and they certainly are a stiff-necked people.[c] ", "10": "So now leave me alone, so that my anger can burn hot against them, so that I may consume them and make you into a great nation.\u201d", "11": "Moses begged the Lord his God and said, \u201cO Lord, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? ", "12": "Why should the Egyptians say, 'He brought them out for an evil purpose, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn back from your fierce anger and change your mind about inflicting disaster on your people. ", "13": "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self. You said to them, 'I will multiply your seed[d] like the stars of the sky, and I will give all this land that I have spoken about to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.'\u201d", "14": "Then the Lord changed his mind about the disaster which he said he would inflict on his people.", "15": "Moses turned and went down the mountain, with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand\u2014tablets that were written on both sides, written on one side and on the other.

But I do hear the sound of people who are celebrating.\u201d", "19": "As soon as Moses came near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing, and Moses' anger burned. So he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.

Then he made the people of Israel drink it.", "21": "Moses said to Aaron, \u201cWhat did these people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin on them?\u201d", "22": "Aaron said, \u201cDo not let the anger of my Lord burn. You know these people. They are set on evil, ", "23": "so they said to me, 'Make a god for us, who will go ahead of us, because this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'

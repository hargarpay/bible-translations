The Israelites camped near Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek. ", "2": "The Philistines formed battle lines to confront the Israelites. As the battle developed, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of the Israelites lined up on the battlefield.", "3": "When the people had come back into the camp, the elders of Israel said, \u201cWhy has the Lord allowed us to be defeated today before the Philistines? Let us bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord here from Shiloh, so that it[b] may come into our midst and save us from the hand of our enemies.\u201d", "4": "So the people sent word to Shiloh, and from there they brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Armies, who sits above the cherubim.

Act like men and fight!\u201d", "10": "So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. A very great slaughter took place, in which thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. ", "11": "God's ark was taken, and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, died.", "12": "A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and came to Shiloh that same day. His clothing was torn, and his face was dirty. ", "13": "When he arrived, Eli was there, sitting on his chair beside the road.

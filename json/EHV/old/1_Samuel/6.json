{"1": "The Lord's ark remained in the country of the Philistines seven months. ", "2": "The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners[a] and asked, \u201cWhat should we do with the Lord's ark? Advise us how we should send it back to its place.\u201d", "3": "They said, \u201cIf you send away the Ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but, by all means, send it to him with a restitution offering. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been removed from you.\u201d[b]", "4": "Then they said, \u201cWhat restitution offering should we send to him?\u201d They said, \u201cThere are five serens of the Philistines, so five gold tumors and five gold mice should be sent, because the same plague was on all of you and on your serens. ", "5": "Therefore you should make replicas of your tumors and figurines of the mice that are ruining your land, and you will give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you, on your gods, and on your land. ", "6": "Why harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After the Lord had dealt ruthlessly with them, didn't the Egyptians let the people go, and they departed?", "7": "\u201cSo make a new cart and take two cows that are nursing their calves, cows that have never had a yoke on them. Hitch the cows to the cart, and take their calves away from them and send them home. ", "8": "Then take the Ark of the Lord and place it on the cart. Place the gold objects, which you are sending to him as a restitution offering, into a box beside the ark. Then send it on its way, and let it go on its own. ", "9": "Watch it. If it goes up on the road toward the border of Israel, to Beth Shemesh, then it is their god who has inflicted this disaster on us. But if not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us. It was a coincidence that this happened to us.\u201d", "10": "So that is what the men did. They took two cows that were nursing calves, hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. ", "11": "Then they put the Ark of the Lord on the cart, along with the box containing the gold mice and the replicas of their tumors. ", "12": "The cows headed straight up the road toward Beth Shemesh. They went straight along the highway without stopping, lowing as they went. They did not turn aside to the right or to the left. The serens of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth Shemesh.", "13": "The people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. They looked up and saw the Ark, and they rejoiced to see it. ", "14": "The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there, near the large stone that was there. Then the people split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. ", "15": "The Levites took the Lord's ark and the box with it, which contained the gold objects, and they put them on the large stone. On that same day, the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrifices to the Lord.", "16": "When the five serens of the Philistines had seen this, they returned to Ekron that same day.", "17": "This is the number of gold tumors that the Philistines sent back as a restitution offering to the Lord: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. ", "18": "The gold mice also corresponded to the number of all the cities of the Philistines that belonged to the five serens, the fortified cities along with the rural villages. The objects were placed on the large stone[c] on which they had placed the Ark of the Lord. That stone remains in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh to this day. ", "19": "The Lord struck some of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the Ark of the Lord. He struck seventy men.[d] Then the people mourned, because the Lord had struck the people with such a heavy blow. ", "20": "The men of Beth Shemesh said, \u201cWho is able to stand before this holy God, the Lord? To whom can we send it[e] to get it away from here?\u201d", "21": "So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim. They said, \u201cThe Philistines have sent back the Ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up for yourselves.\u201d"}

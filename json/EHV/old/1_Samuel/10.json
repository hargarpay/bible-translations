They will tell you, \u201cThe donkeys that you have been looking for have been found. Now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and is worried about the two of you. He is asking, 'What should I do about my son?'\u201d", "3": "As you go on farther from there, you will come to the oak tree at Tabor. Three men going up to God's house at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another will be carrying three loaves of bread, and the third will be carrying a container of wine. ", "4": "They will greet you, ask how you are doing, and give you two loaves of bread, which you are to accept from their hand.", "5": "After that, you will come to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine garrison. When you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place. Musicians with a harp, a hand drum, a flute, and a lyre will be going in front of them, and they will be prophesying. ", "6": "Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you with power, and you will prophesy with them, and you will become a changed man. ", "7": "When you have received these signs, do whatever is appropriate for the occasion,[b] for God is with you.", "8": "Go down to Gilgal ahead of me. Watch for me. I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice fellowship offerings. Wait seven days, until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you are to do.", "9": "As Saul was turning away from Samuel to leave, God gave him a changed heart, and all those signs were fulfilled that day.", "10": "When they came to Gibeah, a band of prophets met Saul, and the Spirit of God came upon him with power, and he prophesied among them. ", "11": "When everyone who had known him previously saw that Saul was prophesying along with the prophets, the people were surprised and said to each other, \u201cWhat has happened to the son of Kish? Is even Saul among the prophets?\u201d", "12": "Someone from that area responded, \u201cWho is their father?\u201d Therefore it became a saying: \u201cIs even Saul among the prophets?\u201d", "13": "When Saul had finished prophesying, he arrived at the high place.", "14": "Saul's uncle asked Saul and his servant, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d Saul said, \u201cTo look for the donkeys. But when we realized that we were not succeeding, we went to Samuel.\u201d", "15": "Saul's uncle said, \u201cPlease tell me what Samuel said to you.\u201d", "16": "Saul said to his uncle, \u201cHe made it clear to us that the donkeys had been found.\u201d But Saul did not tell his uncle anything about the matter of the kingship, about which Samuel had also spoken.", "17": "Samuel called the people together to the Lord at Mizpah. ", "18": "He said to the people of Israel, \u201cThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says. I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you. ", "19": "But today you have rejected your God, the one who saves you out of all your disasters and your distress, and you have said to him, 'You must set a king over us.' Now line up in the presence of the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.\u201d", "20": "So Samuel brought forward all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.[c] ", "21": "Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was chosen.[d] Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, but when they looked for him, he could not be found. ", "22": "Therefore they asked the Lord again, \u201cHas the man arrived here yet?\u201d The Lord answered, \u201cHe has. Look, he is is hiding among the baggage.\u201d", "23": "So they ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was a head taller than any of the people. ", "24": "Samuel said to all the people, \u201cDo you see the one the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.\u201d All the people shouted, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d", "25": "Samuel told the people the regulations concerning the kingship, and he wrote them on a scroll, which was placed before the Lord. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each man to his own house. ", "26": "Saul went home to Gibeah, and the army went with him, those men whose hearts God had touched. ", "27": "But certain worthless good-for-nothings said, \u201cHow can this man save us?\u201d They despised him and brought him no gift, but Saul said nothing."}

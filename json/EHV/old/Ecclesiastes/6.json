Instead, a stranger eats it. This is vapor, and a sickening evil.", "3": "A man may father a hundred children and live many years, but if his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial, no matter how many days he lives, I say, \u201cA stillborn baby is better off than he is.\u201d ", "4": "Why? Because that baby comes like a vapor and leaves in darkness, and its name gets covered in darkness. ", "5": "The baby does not see the sun or know it,[b] but it enjoys more peaceful rest than that man does, ", "6": "even if that man would live a thousand years two times without enjoying good things. They all go to the same place, don't they?", "7": "All of a man's hard work is to feed his mouth, but his appetite[c] never feels satisfied.", "8": "So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool? What advantage does a poor man gain, who knows how to keep walking among the living?[d] ", "9": "Better to have eyes that look at what is actually there than desires that roam.

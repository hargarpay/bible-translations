{"1": "Now Naomi had a relative[a] of her husband, a wealthy, generous[b] man from the clan of Elimelek. His name was Boaz.", "2": "Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, \u201cI am going to go out to the fields, so that I can glean[c] ears of grain wherever I may find favor in the eyes of the owner.\u201d Naomi said to her, \u201cGo ahead, my daughter.\u201d", "3": "So Ruth went out and gleaned in the grain fields after the reapers. It happened that she was in the field that belonged to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek. ", "4": "At just that time, Boaz happened to come out from Bethlehem. He said to the reapers, \u201cThe Lord be with you!\u201d And they said to him, \u201cThe Lord bless you!\u201d", "5": "Then Boaz asked his servant who was in charge of the reapers, \u201cWhose young woman is this?\u201d", "6": "The servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, \u201cShe is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the territory of Moab. ", "7": "She said, 'Please let me follow the reapers and glean and gather stalks into sheaves.' So she came and has been working from early morning till now\u2014except for a short rest in the shelter.\u201d[d]", "8": "Then Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cListen, my daughter.[e] Do not go off to glean in some other field. In fact, do not leave this one at all! Just stick close to my young women here.[f] ", "9": "Keep your eyes on the field where the men are reaping so that you can follow my women. I have commanded the young men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, you may go to the jars and drink from whatever the young men draw out.\u201d", "10": "Then Ruth bowed down with her face to the ground. She said to Boaz, \u201cWhy have I found favor in your eyes, so that you acknowledge me even though I am a foreigner?\u201d", "11": "Boaz replied to her, \u201cI have been fully informed about all that you did for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband and how you left behind your father and mother and the homeland of your relatives, and you came to a people whom you did not know previously. ", "12": "May the Lord reward your work, and may you be paid in full by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge!\u201d", "13": "Then Ruth said, \u201cI have found such favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and you have spoken to the heart of your servant girl\u2014although I cannot be compared to one of your servant girls.\u201d", "14": "At mealtime Boaz said to her, \u201cCome here and eat some of the food, and dip your piece of bread into the sour wine.\u201d[g] So she sat down beside the reapers, and Boaz heaped up a serving of roasted grain for her. She ate until she was full and had some left over.", "15": "When she got up to glean, Boaz ordered his workers, \u201cShe may glean even among our sheaves. You are not to humiliate her in any way. ", "16": "In fact, you can even pull out some stalks from the piles for her, and you can drop them on purpose so that she can glean them, and do not rebuke her at all.\u201d", "17": "So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed what she had gleaned. It amounted to almost a bushel[h] of barley.", "18": "When she picked it up and went into town, her mother-in-law saw how much she had gleaned. Ruth also took what she had left over from her meal and gave it to Naomi.", "19": "Then her mother-in-law said to her, \u201cWhere did you glean today and where did you work? May the man who took notice of you be blessed!\u201d So she told her mother-in-law in whose field she had worked: \u201cThe name of the man in whose field I worked today is Boaz.\u201d", "20": "Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \u201cMay he be blessed by the Lord, whose faithfulness[i] has not forsaken[j] the living and the dead!\u201d Naomi also said to her, \u201cThis man is related to us. He is even one of our family's redeemers.\u201d[k]", "21": "Then Ruth the Moabite said, \u201cHe even said to me, 'Stick close to my workers until they have finished all of the harvest on the land that belongs to me.'\u201d", "22": "Then Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, \u201cIt is good, my daughter, that you can go out with his young women, so that you will not be molested by men in some other field.\u201d", "23": "So Ruth stuck close to Boaz's young women and gleaned until the completion of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest, and she lived with her mother-in-law."}

Therefore I will inflict punishment on you for all your guilt.", "3": "Can two people walk together without agreeing to do so?", "4": "Does a lion roar in the forest if it does not have prey? Does a young lion growl from its den if it has not caught anything?", "5": "Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if there is no bait? Does a trap spring up from the ground when nothing has tripped it?", "6": "If a ram's horn is sounded in a city, the people become alarmed, don't they? If a disaster takes place in a city, is it not the Lord who has done it?", "7": "Certainly the Lord God does not do anything without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.", "8": "A lion has roared! Who can avoid being terrified? The Lord God has spoken! Who can hold back from prophesying?", "9": "Make this known to the citadels in Ashdod and to the citadels in the land of Egypt.

The houses decorated with ivory will be destroyed, and the great houses will come to an end, declares the Lord."}

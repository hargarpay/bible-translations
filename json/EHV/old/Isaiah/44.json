Do not be afraid, my servant Jacob, Jeshurun,[a] whom I have chosen,", "3": "because I will pour out water upon a thirsty land, and streams of water upon dry ground. I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.", "4": "They will spring up like a tree in a grassy meadow,[b] like willows beside flowing streams.", "5": "One person will say, \u201cI belong to the Lord.\u201d Another will be called by the name of Jacob. Another will write on his hand, \u201cBelonging to the Lord,\u201d and he will take the name of Israel.", "6": "This is what the Lord, the King of Israel, Israel's Redeemer, the Lord of Armies, says.

Or he plants a cedar, and rain causes it to grow tall, ", "15": "but it becomes fuel for a man to burn. He takes part of it to warm himself. He lights a fire to bake bread, and then from the rest he makes a god and worships it. He carves an idol and bows down to it. ", "16": "Half of it he burns in a fire\u2014over that half he eats meat. He roasts meat and is satisfied. So he is warm and says, \u201cAh! I am warm. I see the light of the fire.\u201d ", "17": "Then from what is left he makes a god to serve as his idol.

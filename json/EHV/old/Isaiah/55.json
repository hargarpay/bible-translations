Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.", "2": "Why do you spend money on something that is not bread? Why do you waste your labor on something that does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good. Satisfy your appetite with rich food.", "3": "Turn your ear toward me, and come to me. Listen, so that you may continue to live. Yes, I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the faithful mercies promised to David.", "4": "Look, I appointed him as a witness for peoples, a leader and commander of peoples.", "5": "Look, you will call out to a nation you do not know, and a nation that does not know you will run to you, on account of the Lord your God, because of the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you.", "6": "Seek the Lord while he may be found! Call on him while he is near!", "7": "Let the wicked man abandon his way. Let an evil man abandon his thoughts. Let him turn to the Lord, and he will show him mercy.

The mountains and the hills will break out in shouts of joy before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.", "13": "Instead of thorns, a fir tree will grow up. Instead of briers, a myrtle tree will grow up. This will make a name for the Lord. It will serve as an everlasting sign that will not be cut off."}

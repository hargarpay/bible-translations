He has condemned them to destruction. He has handed them over for slaughter.", "3": "Their fallen bodies will lie unburied, and the stench of their corpses will linger. The mountains will flow with their blood.", "4": "The whole army of the heavens will fall apart. The sky will be rolled up like a scroll, and its whole army will waste away and fall, like leaves withering on a vine, like fruit that falls from a fig tree.", "5": "Yes, my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens. Now it will fall on Edom, on the people I have sentenced to judgment.", "6": "The sword of the Lord is covered with blood. It is coated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat from the kidneys of rams, for the Lord has made a sacrifice in Bozrah, a massive slaughter in the land of Edom.", "7": "Wild oxen will fall along with them, bull calves and powerful bulls.

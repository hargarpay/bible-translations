Mountains then would quake because of your presence.[a]", "2": "As fire ignites stubble and as fire makes water boil, make your name known to your adversaries. Then nations would quake in your presence.", "3": "You did amazing things that we did not expect. You came down. Mountains quaked because of your presence.", "4": "From ancient times no one has heard. No ear has understood.

How can you remain silent and afflict us without limit?"}

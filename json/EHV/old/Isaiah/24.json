The world fades and withers away. The proud people of the earth fade away.", "5": "The earth is polluted by its inhabitants, because they have bypassed the laws. They have changed the statutes and set aside the everlasting covenant.", "6": "Therefore a curse devours the earth, and those who live there will be found guilty. That is why the inhabitants of the earth will be burned up, and so few will remain.", "7": "The new wine mourns. The vine dries up. Those who were feeling merry now sigh.", "8": "The happy sound of drums has ceased. The noise of partying has ended. The joyful lyre is silent.", "9": "They will drink no wine with their songs anymore. Beer[a] is bitter to those who drink it.", "10": "The city is in chaos and ruins.

Joyful celebration is banished from the land.", "12": "The city is left desolate, and the gate is smashed into pieces.", "13": "This is the way it will be among the peoples on earth: It will be like an olive tree after it has been picked over, like the gleanings left after the grape harvest.", "14": "They raise their voices and sing for joy.

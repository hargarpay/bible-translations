{"1": "An oracle against Moab. In one night, Ar[a] of Moab has been ruined and brought to nothing. In one night, Kir of Moab has been ruined and brought to nothing.", "2": "They have gone up to the temple at Dibon, up to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Every head is shaved. Every beard is cut off.", "3": "They wear sackcloth in their streets. On the rooftops and in the public squares, everyone wails. They all collapse in tears.", "4": "Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even in Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their spirit is weak.", "5": "My heart cries out for Moab! Her refugees[b] flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the Ascent of Luhith, weeping all the way. On the way to Horonaim, they weep continuously over their destruction.", "6": "The waters of Nimrim are dried up. The grass has withered away. The vegetation has died, and no green thing remains.", "7": "So they will carry across the Ravine of Poplars[c] whatever remains from the wealth they acquired and from the supplies they stored up.", "8": "For a cry has echoed around the borders of Moab. The wailing reaches to Eglaim and all the way to Be'er Elim.", "9": "For the waters of Dimon are full of blood,[d] and I will bring still more on Dimon. I will bring a lion upon the refugees of Moab and upon the survivors who remain in the land."}

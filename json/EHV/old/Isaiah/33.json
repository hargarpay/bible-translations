When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed, and when you have finished betraying, you will be betrayed.", "2": "O Lord, be gracious to us. We wait hopefully for you. Be our strength every morning. Be our salvation in times of trouble.", "3": "At the thunder of your voice, people flee. When you stir up your great power, nations scatter.", "4": "Your plunder will be taken away the way a caterpillar[a] eats things up. People will swarm on it like a locust swarm.", "5": "The Lord is exalted, because he dwells on high. He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness.", "6": "There will be stability in your time, a wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. Your treasure will be the fear of the Lord.", "7": "Listen! Their elite troops[b] are crying in the streets. The peace envoys weep bitterly.", "8": "The highways are deserted. All travel has stopped. The treaty has been broken. Witnesses[c] are despised, and no one is respected.", "9": "The land mourns and becomes weak. Lebanon is ashamed and withers away. The Plain of Sharon is like the Arabah, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.", "10": "Now I will arise, says the Lord. Now I will lift myself up. Now I will be exalted.", "11": "You will conceive chaff and give birth to stubble.

You who are close by, acknowledge my mighty acts.", "14": "The sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the ungodly. Who of us can live with a consuming fire? Who of us can live in a place that burns without end?", "15": "Those who walk righteously and speak blamelessly, those who despise dishonest gain, whose hands refuse a bribe, whose ears will not listen to violent plans, whose eyes reject evil\u2014", "16": "they will dwell on high.

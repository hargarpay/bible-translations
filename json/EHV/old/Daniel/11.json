Then the fourth one will gain great riches, more than anyone else. As he becomes strong through his riches, he will stir everyone up against the kingdom of Greece.", "3": "A warrior king will arise. He will rule a great dominion and will do as he pleases. ", "4": "But as he rises, his kingdom will be broken and be divided to the four winds of heaven, but it will not be passed on to his descendants. It will not be ruled with the same ruling power with which he ruled, because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others besides these.", "5": "The King of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become stronger than he and rule a dominion greater than his.[f]", "6": "After some years, they will make an alliance. The daughter of the King of the South will come to the King of the North and make a fair agreement. However, she will not keep the strength of her arm, and he and his arm[g] will not endure.

{"1": "The word of the Lord came to me. ", "2": "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre that this is what the Lord God says. Because you became arrogant and said, \u201cI am a god, and I occupy a throne of a god in the heart of the seas,\u201d even though you are a mere man and not a god, and because you regard your wisdom as divine wisdom\u2014 ", "3": "You really think you are wiser than Daniel, don't you? No mystery baffles you. ", "4": "By your wisdom and your shrewdness you have gained wealth for yourself and put gold and silver into your treasuries.

Because you regard your wisdom as divine wisdom, ", "7": "therefore, I am about to bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations. They will unsheathe their swords against your beautiful wisdom, and they will desecrate your radiant splendor.

Say to him that this is what the Lord God says. You were a seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. ", "13": "You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone was covering you: carnelian, diamond, emerald, topaz, onyx, jasper, sapphire, agate, and beryl.[a] Your mountings and your settings were worked in gold. They were prepared on the day you were created.", "14": "You were a cherub, the anointed guardian. I appointed you. You were on the holy mountain of God, and you walked about in the midst of sparkling stones. ", "15": "Your conduct was blameless from the day you were created until guilt was found in you. ", "16": "In your widespread trade, you practiced much violence and you sinned. I defiled you by banishing you from the mountain of God. I expelled you, you guardian cherub, from among the sparkling stones.", "17": "You became arrogant because of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom together with your splendor. So I hurled you down to the earth and set you in front of kings who gloated over you. ", "18": "By your many sins during your unscrupulous trade, you defiled your sanctuaries. So I made fire break out from your midst, and it devoured you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.

Then they will live on their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. ", "26": "They will live on it in security. They will build houses and plant vineyards. They will live on it in security when I inflict judgments upon all those around them who despise them. Then they will know that I am the Lord, their God."}

", "4": "The Glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east. ", "5": "Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court, and the Glory of the Lord filled the temple.", "6": "I heard someone speaking to me from the temple while the man was standing beside me. ", "7": "The voice said to me: Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and this is the place for the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. Never again will the house of Israel profane my holy name, neither they nor their kings, neither by their prostitution nor by the memorials[b] to their dead kings at their high places.

", "9": "Now let them remove their prostitution and the memorials of their dead kings from my presence, and I will dwell among them forever.", "10": "But you, son of man, are to describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them measure its perfect pattern. ", "11": "If they are ashamed of everything they have done, teach them the design of the temple and its layout, its exits and its entrances, all its designs and all its ordinances, all its designs and all its regulations. Write them down in their sight so that they may keep its whole plan and all its ordinances and carry them out. ", "12": "This is the law for the temple. On the top of the mountain, the whole territory of the temple and all the area surrounding its perimeter will be most holy. This is indeed the law for the temple.", "13": "These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits (a long cubit is an ordinary cubit plus a handbreadth). The gutter[c] at the base of the altar is one cubit deep and one cubit wide with a rim of one span[d] around its edge. The height of the altar is as follows: ", "14": "From the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge is two cubits, and the width of the ledge is one cubit. From the lower ledge to the upper ledge is four cubits. The upper ledge has a width of one cubit.

The ridge[f] around it is half a cubit, and it has a gutter of one cubit all around.[g] Its ramp[h] faces east.", "18": "Then he said to me, \u201cSon of man, this is what the Lord God says. These are the ceremonial requirements for the altar on the day when it is erected, to present burnt offerings on it and to splash blood on it.

{"1": "The word of the Lord came to me.", "2": "Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them. ", "3": "You are to tell the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says. Because you said \u201cAha!\u201d against my sanctuary when it was desecrated, and against the land of Israel when it was devastated, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile, ", "4": "therefore, I am about to give you to the people of the East as their possession. They will set up their camps in your midst and place their dwellings among you. They will eat your produce, and they will drink your milk. ", "5": "I will make Rabbah into a camel pasture and Ammon into a sheepfold. Then you will know that I am the Lord.", "6": "So this is what the Lord God says. Because you clapped your hands and stomped your feet and celebrated against the land of Israel with all the contempt in your soul, ", "7": "therefore, I have stretched out my hand against you, and I have given you as plunder[a] to the nations. I have cut you off from the peoples, and I have made you perish from among the countries. When I have exterminated you, you will know that I am the Lord.[b]", "8": "This is what the Lord God says. Because Moab and Seir said, \u201cLook! The house of Judah is just like all the nations,\u201d ", "9": "I am about to open up the flank[c] of Moab from one end to the other: its cities, its border towns, and the glory of the land, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim. ", "10": "I will deliver Moab, together with the Ammonites, into the possession of the people of the East. I will hand them over to the people of the East as their possession so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations.

Because Edom has inflicted bitter revenge on the house of Judah and has incurred great guilt by pursuing revenge against Judah, ", "13": "therefore, this is what the Lord God says. I will stretch out my hand against Edom. I will cut off man and beast from it and turn it into a wasteland. From Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.

So they will experience my revenge, declares the Lord God.", "15": "This is what the Lord God says. Because the Philistines pursued revenge and carried their revenge to an extreme, with bitter contempt in their soul, in order to destroy Judah with everlasting hatred, ", "16": "therefore, this is what the Lord God says. I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines. I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy those who remain by the seacoast. ", "17": "I will carry out great acts of revenge and furious punishments among them, and they will know that I am the Lord when I lay my revenge upon them."}

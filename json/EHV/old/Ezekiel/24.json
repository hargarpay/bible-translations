Woe to the bloody city, a pot whose residue[e] is inside it, whose residue has not gone out of it! Take out its cuts of meat piece by piece, without choosing one piece in preference to another.[f] ", "7": "Do this because the blood she shed remains within her. She spilled it on a bare rock. She did not pour it on the ground, where the soil would cover it.

With one blow I am taking away from you what your eyes desire. You must not mourn or cry. Your tears must not flow. ", "17": "Groan silently. Perform no mourning rites for the dead. Bind your turban on your head. Put your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your upper lip. Do not eat the food people bring to mourners.", "18": "So I spoke to the people that morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.

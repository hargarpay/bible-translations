{"1": "Then he called out with a loud voice in my hearing, \u201cBring the supervisors of the city here, each one of them with his weapon of destruction in his hand.\u201d ", "2": "Then I noticed six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces north, each with his weapon, a war club, in his hand. There was also one man in the middle, dressed in linen, with a scribe's kit at his waist. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.", "3": "Now the Glory of the God of Israel ascended from above the cherub, over whom it had been standing, and moved to the threshold of the temple building. He called out to the man who was dressed in linen, who had the scribe's kit at his waist. ", "4": "The Lord said to him, \u201cGo through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a cross mark[a] on the foreheads of those who moan and lament over the abominations being committed in her.\u201d ", "5": "To the others he said in my hearing, \u201cFollow him through the city and strike the people down. Do not let your eye show pity, and do not have compassion. ", "6": "Old men and young men, virgins, little children, and women\u2014you are to keep killing until you wipe them out completely. But do not go near anyone who has been marked with the cross. You are to begin at my sanctuary.\u201d So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple. ", "7": "Then he said to them, \u201cDefile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!\u201d So they went and struck them down throughout the city.", "8": "While they were striking them down, I was left alone and I fell facedown and cried out, \u201cOh, Lord God! Are you going to destroy everyone who is left in Israel, as you pour out your wrath upon Jerusalem?\u201d ", "9": "He said to me, \u201cThe guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great. The land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of injustice, because they say, 'The Lord has forsaken the land' and 'The Lord does not see.' ", "10": "But I am determined that my eye will show no pity, and I will have no compassion. I will bring down their conduct on their own heads.\u201d ", "11": "Just then, I saw the man dressed in linen, who had the scribe's kit at his waist. He was reporting, \u201cI have done just as you commanded me.\u201d"}

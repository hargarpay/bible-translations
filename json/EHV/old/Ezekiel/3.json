Eat this scroll, and then go, speak to the house of Israel.\u201d ", "2": "I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll.", "3": "Then he said to me, \u201cSon of man, feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll that I am giving you.\u201d I ate, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey.", "4": "He then said to me, \u201cSon of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. ", "5": "For you are not being sent to a people who have incomprehensible speech or a difficult language, but you are being sent to the house of Israel. ", "6": "Nor are you being sent to many peoples who have incomprehensible speech and difficult languages, whose words you cannot understand. Certainly, if I were to send you to such people, they would listen to you. ", "7": "But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, because the whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted. ", "8": "Look, I have made your face just as hard as their faces and your forehead just as hard as their foreheads. ", "9": "I have made your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not fear them, and do not be intimidated by their looks, for they are a rebellious house.\u201d", "10": "Then he said to me, \u201cSon of man, receive into your heart all my words that I will speak to you, and hear them with your ears. ", "11": "Go now to the exiles, to your own people.[a] You shall speak to them and say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says,' whether they listen or they do not.\u201d", "12": "Then the Spirit[b] lifted me up, and I heard a loud rushing sound behind me\u2014Blessed be the Glory of the Lord in its dwelling place!\u2014 ", "13": "It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures beating against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. ", "14": "The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and so I went, bitter and heated in my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was upon me with power. ", "15": "I came to the exiles at Tel Aviv, who were living by the Kebar Canal\u2014there where they were living.[c] I sat among them for seven days\u2014stunned.", "16": "At the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me and said:", "17": "Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, you must give them a warning from me. ", "18": "When I announce to a wicked man, \u201cYou shall surely die,\u201d if you do not warn him, and you do not speak up to warn the wicked man against his wicked way so that he can live, then that wicked man will die because of his guilt, and I will hold you responsible for his blood. ", "19": "But you, if you warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die because of his guilt, but you will have saved your own life. ", "20": "Or when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and becomes unrighteous, and I place a stumbling block in front of him, he shall die. If you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he had done will not be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for his blood.

The Glory of the Lord was standing there, just like the Glory that I had seen by the Kebar Canal, and I fell on my face. ", "24": "But the Spirit entered into me and brought me to my feet. Then he spoke to me and said to me, \u201cGo, shut yourself up inside your house. ", "25": "And this is what will happen to you, son of man. They will certainly place ropes upon you and tie you up with them, so that you will not be able to go out among them. ", "26": "I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, so that you will be speechless, and you will not be able to rebuke[d] them, for they are a rebellious house. ", "27": "But whenever I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says.' Whoever listens, let him listen. Whoever refuses to listen, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.\u201d"}

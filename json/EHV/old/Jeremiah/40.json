This took place because you people[a] sinned against the Lord and did not obey him. ", "4": "But now, today, I am removing the chains from your wrists. If you wish, come with me to Babylon. I will take care of you. But if this does not seem good to you, then don't come. The whole land is before you. If there is a place that seems good and right to you, go there.\u201d ", "5": "But before Jeremiah turned away, he added, \u201cOr you can go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan.

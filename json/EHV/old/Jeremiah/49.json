Her villages will be burned down, and then Israel will possess those who possessed him, declares the Lord.", "3": "Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste! Cry, you daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn. Run back and forth behind the walls, because Milcom is about to go into captivity, with his priests and his officials.", "4": "Why do you boast about your valleys, your flowing valley, you backsliding daughter? You trusted in your treasures, saying, \u201cWho will come against me?\u201d", "5": "Look out! I will bring terror upon you, says the Lord God of Armies, terror from every side.

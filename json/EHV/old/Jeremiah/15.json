The birds in the sky and the wild animals in the land will devour and destroy. ", "4": "I will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.", "5": "Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will turn back to ask how you are?", "6": "You have rejected me, declares the Lord. You have turned away from me. So I will stretch out my hand against you and destroy you. I am weary of showing compassion.", "7": "I will scatter them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I will make them childless. I will destroy my people, because they have not changed their ways.", "8": "I will make their widows more numerous than the sand on the seashore. At noon I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men. I will bring anguish and terror down on them suddenly.", "9": "The mother of seven will grow faint. She will breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day, and she will be ashamed and humiliated. The survivors I will put to the sword in the presence of their enemies, declares the Lord.", "10": "I am so miserable, my mother, that you gave birth to me.

Your words became my joy, the delight of my heart, because I bear your name, O Lord God of Armies.", "17": "I did not sit with the band of partygoers, nor did I celebrate with them. I sat alone, because your hand was upon me. You filled me with indignation.", "18": "Why is my pain unending? Why is my wound incurable, refusing to heal? Will you be as deceptive as an intermittent stream to me, like a source of water that a person can't depend on?", "19": "Therefore this is what the Lord says. If you repent, I will take you back, so that you may stand before me. If what you say is worthwhile and not worthless, you will be my spokesman.

", "3": "Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning for them, each of them will turn from his evil ways. Then I will forgive their guilt and their sin.", "4": "So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah. While Jeremiah dictated all the words that the Lord had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. ", "5": "Then Jeremiah gave an order to Baruch, saying, \u201cI am restricted from going into the House of the Lord, ", "6": "so you will have to go. Read from the scroll you have written at my dictation. Read it in the hearing of all the people of Judah who have come from their cities on a day of fasting.

", "10": "Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll in the House of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people. This was at the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan, the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the House of the Lord.", "11": "When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll, ", "12": "he went into the secretary's room in the king's palace. All the officials happened to be sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. ", "13": "Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.

Did Jeremiah dictate this to you?\u201d", "18": "Baruch answered, \u201cHe dictated[a] all of these things to me, and I wrote them with ink on the scroll.\u201d", "19": "Then the officials said to Baruch, \u201cYou and Jeremiah go and hide. Do not let anyone know where you are.\u201d", "20": "They put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, and then they went to the king in the court.

But the Lord hid them.", "27": "After the king had burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:", "28": "Take another scroll, and write all the earlier words on it that were on the first scroll, the one that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.", "29": "Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, say: This is what the Lord says. You yourself have burned this scroll. You asked, \u201cWhy did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy the land and cut off both men and animals?\u201d ", "30": "That is why the Lord says this about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David's throne. His dead body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. ", "31": "I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their guilt. I will bring on them and on everyone who lives in Jerusalem and the men of Judah every disaster I have pronounced against them, because they did not listen.", "32": "Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to his scribe Baruch son of Neriah, who wrote on it all the same words that had been on the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them."}

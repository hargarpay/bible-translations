I will restore them to the land I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it, says the Lord.", "4": "These are words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah. ", "5": "This is what the Lord says. \u201cWe have heard cries of fear, of terror, and not of peace.\u201d", "6": "Ask and see. Can a man give birth to a child? Why then do I see every strong man with his hands on his belly like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?", "7": "That day is so terrible that there is none like it! It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.", "8": "In that day, declares the Lord of Armies, I will break the yoke off your neck. I will tear away your bonds.

Your injury is severe.", "13": "There is no one to plead your cause, no one to bind your wounds. There are no healing medicines.", "14": "All who loved you have forgotten you. They do not ask about you. I have wounded you as an enemy would. I have punished you as the cruel would, because your guilt is so great, because your sins are so many.", "15": "Why are you crying over your injury, over your incurable wound? It is because of your great guilt, because of your many sins, that I have done these things to you.", "16": "Yet all who devour you will be devoured. All your enemies, every one of them, will go into captivity. Those who plunder you will be plundered. All who prey on you will become prey.", "17": "For I will restore your health, and I will heal your wounds, declares the Lord, because they have called you an outcast, saying, \u201cIt is Zion\u2014for whom no one cares.\u201d", "18": "This is what the Lord says. Look, I will end the captivity[b] of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings. The city will be rebuilt on the mound of its ruins, and the citadel will stand in its rightful place.", "19": "Thanksgiving will come out of them, along with the sound of rejoicing. I will multiply them, and they will not decrease in number.

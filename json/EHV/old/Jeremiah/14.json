{"1": "This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.", "2": "Judah mourns. Her city gates fall apart. They mourn for the land, and a cry of grief rises from Jerusalem.", "3": "The strong send the weak to get water. They go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with empty containers. Ashamed and humiliated, they cover their heads.", "4": "The ground is cracked, because there has been no rain in the land. The farmers are distressed. They cover their heads.", "5": "Even the doe in the field gives birth and then abandons the fawn, because there is no grass.", "6": "Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights. They pant for air like jackals. Their eyes grow dim, because there are no plants to eat.", "7": "Do something, Lord, for the sake of your name, even though our guilt testifies against us. We have rebelled many times, and we have sinned against you.", "8": "You are Israel's hope, its Savior in times of trouble. Why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who stays only for the night?", "9": "Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a strong warrior who cannot save? You are among us, Lord, and we are called by your name. Do not forsake us!", "10": "This is what the Lord says concerning this people. They love to wander! They never restrain their feet. So the Lord does not accept them. Instead, he will remember their guilt and punish their sins.", "11": "The Lord told me, \u201cDo not pray for the well-being of these people. ", "12": "Even if they fast, I will not listen to their cries for help. Even if they sacrifice burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them.

I will give you lasting peace in this place.'\u201d", "14": "Then the Lord said this to me: Those prophets are prophesying lies in my name, but I did not send them. I did not command them, and I did not speak to them. They are prophesying a false vision to you and providing worthless omens\u2014something from their own imagination. ", "15": "Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the prophets who prophesy lies in my name. I did not send them. They say that there will be no sword or famine in this land, but by sword and famine those prophets will die.

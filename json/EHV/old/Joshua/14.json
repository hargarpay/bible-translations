", "2": "The inheritances for nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh were determined by lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses.", "3": "Moses had already assigned inheritances to two tribes and to one half tribe in the region east of the Jordan, but to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among the other tribes. ", "4": "Because the sons of Joseph had been divided into two tribes, namely, Manasseh and Ephraim, the Levites did not receive a tribal territory in the land. They did, however, receive cities to live in along with the cities' pasturelands for their cattle and property.[b] ", "5": "Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, that is what the people of Israel did when they apportioned the land.", "6": "When the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal, Caleb son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, said this to him: You know what the Lord spoke to Moses, the man of God, concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea.

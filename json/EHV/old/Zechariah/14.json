A day is coming for the Lord, when the plunder taken from you will be divided in your presence.", "2": "I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem, and the city will be taken, the houses plundered, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.", "3": "Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. ", "4": "On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. The Mount of Olives will be split in two, from east to west, making a very large valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and the other half toward the south. ", "5": "You will flee through my mountain valley, because the mountain valley will reach to Azal. Yes, you will flee, just as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones will come with him.[a]", "6": "On that day there will be no light.

On that day the Lord will be the one, and his name will be the one.", "10": "The whole land will be changed into a plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be elevated and remain in her place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses. ", "11": "It will be inhabited, and it will no longer be devoted to destruction. Jerusalem will dwell in security.", "12": "This will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples who have waged war against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. ", "13": "On that day there will be a great panic from the Lord among them. They will seize each other by the hand, and the hand of each one will be raised up against his neighbor. ", "14": "Even Judah will fight against[e] Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected: gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance. ", "15": "In the same way a plague will afflict the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and all the animals that will be in those camps.", "16": "Then every survivor who is left from all the nations that went up against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of Armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters. ", "17": "But if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Armies, no rain will fall on them.

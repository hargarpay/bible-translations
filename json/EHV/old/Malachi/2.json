{"1": "Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.", "2": "If you do not listen, if you do not set your heart on giving glory to my name, says the Lord of Armies, then I will send the curse[a] against you. I will curse your blessings. In fact, I have already cursed your offerings because you are not putting your heart into it. ", "3": "Yes, I will rebuke your offspring.[b] I will smear animal bowels and their contents on your faces, the bowels produced by your festivals, and you will be hauled off with them.[c]", "4": "You will know that I sent you this commandment, so that my covenant with Levi may continue, says the Lord of Armies. ", "5": "My covenant with him was life and peace, which I gave to him. It was a covenant of reverence,[d] and he revered me. He respected my name. ", "6": "The true law was in his mouth, and no injustice was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness. He turned many away from guilt. ", "7": "The lips of a priest should be guardians of knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth because he is a messenger of the Lord of Armies.", "8": "But you priests have turned from the way. You have made many people stumble in regard to the law.[e] You have ruined the covenant with Levi, says the Lord of Armies. ", "9": "So I have made you despised and humiliated in the view of all the people, because you are not keeping my ways but are showing favoritism in carrying out the law.", "10": "Don't we all have one Father? Hasn't one God created us? Why then do we violate our vows to each other, polluting the covenant of our fathers? ", "11": "Judah has acted unfaithfully. A detestable thing was done in Israel and in Jerusalem when Judah polluted the holy place[f] of the Lord, which the Lord loves. Judah is married to the daughter of a foreign god. ", "12": "May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob any man who does this, both the one who is awake and the one who answers,[g] even if he brings an offering to the Lord of Armies!", "13": "This is the second thing you do: You cover the Lord's altar with tears, with weeping and crying, because there is no longer any favorable response to your offering, and God is not pleased with anything from your hand. ", "14": "So you ask, \u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d This is why\u2014because the Lord is a witness in the case between you and the wife you married when you were young, because you have betrayed her\u2014though she was your partner, the wife with whom you made a covenant! ", "15": "No one has done this who has a remnant of the Spirit.[h] And why one? He is seeking offspring from God.[i] So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not act unfaithfully against the wife you married when you were young. ", "16": "He hates divorce! That is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says. He hates it when a person wears violence as a garment. That is what the Lord of Armies says. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be unfaithful.", "17": "You have made the Lord weary with your words. You say, \u201cHow have we made him weary?\u201d Whenever you say that anyone who does evil is good in the Lord's eyes or that the Lord takes pleasure in evildoers. Or whenever you say, \u201cWhere is the God of justice?\u201d"}

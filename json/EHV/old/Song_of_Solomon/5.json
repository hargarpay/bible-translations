{"1": "I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey. I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink! Be intoxicated with love!", "2": "I was sleeping but my heart was awake. A sound! My lover is knocking: \u201cOpen to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one, because my head is soaked with dew, my locks with the dampness of the night.\u201d", "3": "\u201cI have taken off my robe. Why should I get dressed again? I have washed my feet. Why should I get them dirty again?\u201d", "4": "My lover thrust his hand through the opening in the door. My feelings were aroused for him.", "5": "I arose to open for my lover. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.", "6": "I opened for my lover, but my lover had left. He was gone. My spirits sank when he left.[b] I looked for him but did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer.", "7": "The watchmen who patrol the city found me. They beat me. They bruised me.

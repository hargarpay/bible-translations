The nations also divided up my land.", "3": "They cast lots for my people and traded boys to pay prostitutes.

If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily repay onto your own heads what you have done,", "5": "because you took my silver and my gold, and you carried off my best treasures to your temples.", "6": "You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, in order to send them far from their own borders.", "7": "See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will make what you have done return on your own heads.", "8": "I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.[d] Yes, the Lord has spoken.", "9": "Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate yourselves for war!

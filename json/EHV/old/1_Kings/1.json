She will lie close to him and keep my lord the king warm.\u201d", "3": "So they searched the whole territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman.

Then you are to blow the ram's horn and say, 'Long live King Solomon!' ", "35": "Then you are to follow him, as he goes in and sits on my throne, and he will be king in my place. I decree that he will be leader over Israel and Judah.\u201d", "36": "Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada responded to the king, \u201cAmen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, confirm this!

The people were playing flutes and rejoicing so greatly that the ground shook from the sound. ", "41": "When Adonijah and all his guests heard it, they stopped eating. Joab heard the sound of the ram's horn and asked, \u201cWhy is the noise from the city so loud?\u201d", "42": "Just then, while he was still speaking, Jonathan, son of Abiathar the priest, came in. Adonijah said, \u201cCome in, for you are a worthy man, and you must be bringing good news.\u201d", "43": "Jonathan responded to Adonijah: Not at all! Our lord King David has made Solomon king!

{"1": "Then Ben Hadad king of Aram, along with thirty-two kings, mobilized his whole army with their horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege to Samaria and fought against it. ", "2": "He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel in the city, ", "3": "who said to him, \u201cThis is what Ben Hadad says. Your silver and your gold are mine. The best of your wives and your children are mine.\u201d", "4": "The king of Israel answered, \u201cJust as you have said, my lord the king, I and all that I own are yours.\u201d", "5": "The messengers came a second time and said, \u201cThis is what Ben Hadad says. I did indeed send word to you, saying, 'You must give me your silver and your gold and your wives and your children.' ", "6": "So at this time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you, and they will search your palace and the houses of your officials, and they will gather up everything that you value and take it away.\u201d", "7": "The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land. \u201cSee how this man is looking for trouble. When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him.\u201d", "8": "All the elders and all the people said to him, \u201cDo not listen and do not agree to this!\u201d", "9": "So he told Ben Hadad's messengers, \u201cSay this to your lord the king. Everything which you demanded of your servant the first time, I will do, but this thing I cannot do.\u201d So the messengers brought his message back to the king.", "10": "Then Ben Hadad sent word to him: \u201cMay the gods punish me severely and even double it, if the dust left from Samaria will be enough to give a handful to each of those who follow me.\u201d", "11": "The king of Israel answered, \u201cTell him that someone who is putting his armor on should not boast like someone who is taking it off.\u201d", "12": "When he heard this message, Ben Hadad and his kings were in their tents drinking. He said to his servants, \u201cGet ready!\u201d and they took up positions against the city.", "13": "But then, at that time, a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and said, \u201cThis is what the Lord says. Do you see all of this huge horde?[a] Look, I am giving it into your hands today. Then you will know that I am the Lord.\u201d", "14": "Then Ahab said, \u201cThrough whom will this happen?\u201d The prophet answered, \u201cThis is what the Lord says. It will be through the young officers from the provinces.\u201d He said, \u201cWho will start the battle?\u201d He said, \u201cYou will.\u201d", "15": "So Ahab inspected the young officers from the provinces and found that there were two hundred thirty-two. After inspecting them he inspected the whole army. The Israelites numbered seven thousand men. ", "16": "They marched out at noon while Ben Hadad was getting drunk in his tent, along with the thirty-two kings who were supporting him. ", "17": "So the young officers from the provinces marched out first. Ben Hadad sent out scouts, who told him, \u201cMen are marching out of Samaria!\u201d", "18": "Ben Hadad said, \u201cIf they have come out for peace, take them alive! Even if they have come out for war, take them alive!\u201d ", "19": "But when the young officers from the provinces and the army that was with them marched out, ", "20": "each of them killed his opponent. Then the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad king of Aram fled on a horse with his charioteers.[b]", "21": "The king of Israel marched out and attacked the horses and chariots. He inflicted a great defeat on Aram.", "22": "Afterward the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, \u201cStrengthen your position and consider carefully what you should do, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you.\u201d", "23": "The king of Aram's officials said to him, \u201cTheir gods are gods of the hills. That is why they defeated us. But if we fight them on the plain, we will certainly defeat them. ", "24": "Now do this. Remove the kings from their positions as field commanders, and replace them with military officers. ", "25": "Then raise an army like the army you lost\u2014horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then if we fight them on the plain, we will certainly defeat them.\u201d The king listened to them and did what they recommended.", "26": "When spring came, Ben Hadad mobilized the army of Aram and went up to Aphek to wage war against Israel. ", "27": "The Israelites also were mobilized and given provisions, and they went out to confront the Arameans. The Israelites camped across from them, like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the land.", "28": "Then the man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, \u201cThis is what the Lord says. Because the Arameans said, 'The Lord is a god of the hills, but not a god of the valleys,' I will give all of this huge horde into your hands. Then you will know that I am the Lord.\u201d", "29": "So they camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle was joined by both armies. The Israelites struck down the Arameans\u2014one hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day. ", "30": "The survivors fled to the city of Aphek, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the survivors. Ben Hadad also fled and went into the city, to an inner room.", "31": "Then his officials said to him, \u201cLook, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. So let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will spare your life.\u201d", "32": "So they wrapped sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads, and they went to the king of Israel and said, \u201cYour servant, Ben Hadad, says, 'Please spare my life.'\u201d Ahab said, \u201cIs he still alive? He is my brother.\u201d[c]", "33": "The men took this as a good omen, so they quickly latched on to what he said and responded, \u201cBen Hadad is your brother.\u201d Then Ahab said, \u201cGo get him.\u201d So Ben Hadad came out to him, and Ahab brought him up into his chariot.", "34": "Ben Hadad said to him, \u201cI will return the cities that my father took from your father, and you may put your own trading centers in Damascus, just as my father put them in Samaria.\u201d Then Ahab said, \u201cUnder these terms, I release you.\u201d So he made a treaty[d] with Ben Hadad and let him go.", "35": "Then by the word of the Lord one of the sons of the prophets[e] said to his neighbor, \u201cStrike me, please.\u201d But the man refused to strike him. ", "36": "So he said to him, \u201cBecause you did not listen to the voice of the Lord, when you leave me, a lion will kill you.\u201d When he left him, a lion found him and killed him.", "37": "Then he found another man and said, \u201cStrike me, please.\u201d The man struck him and wounded him. ", "38": "The prophet went and stood before the king at the road and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.", "39": "When the king was passing by, the prophet shouted to the king, \u201cYour servant went out in the middle of the battle. Then someone brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man. If you can't account for him, then it will be your life for his life, or you will have to pay a talent of silver.' ", "40": "But while your servant was busy doing this and that, all of a sudden the man was gone!\u201d Then the king of Israel said to him, \u201cThat is your sentence. You have pronounced it on yourself.\u201d", "41": "Then he quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.", "42": "He said to the king, \u201cThis is what the Lord says. Because you set a man free, whom I had devoted to destruction, it will be your life for his life and your people for his people.\u201d ", "43": "The king of Israel headed for his palace sullen and angry, and he arrived in Samaria."}

", "3": "He said, \u201cMy lord,[a] if I have now found favor in your sight, please do not pass your servant by. ", "4": "Now let me get a little water so that all of you can wash your feet and rest under the tree. ", "5": "Let me get some bread so that you can refresh yourselves. After that you may go your way. That is why you have come to your servant.\u201d They said, \u201cYes, do as you have said.\u201d", "6": "Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, \u201cQuickly prepare twenty quarts[b] of fine flour, knead it, and make some loaves of bread.\u201d ", "7": "Abraham ran to the herd, brought a good, tender calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to prepare it. ", "8": "He took cheese curds, milk, and the calf that he had prepared and set it before them. He stood beside them under the tree while they ate.", "9": "They asked him, \u201cWhere is Sarah, your wife?\u201d He said, \u201cShe is over there in the tent.\u201d", "10": "One of the men said, \u201cI will certainly return to you when this season comes around next year. Then Sarah your wife will have a son.\u201d Sarah was listening to this from the tent door, which was behind him. ", "11": "Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well into old age. Sarah was past the age for childbearing.[c] ", "12": "Sarah laughed to herself, saying, \u201cAfter I am worn out, will I have pleasure, since my Lord is also old?\u201d", "13": "The Lord said to Abraham, \u201cWhy did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really give birth to a child though I am old?' ", "14": "Is anything impossible for the Lord? At the set time next year I will return to you, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d", "15": "Then Sarah denied it and said, \u201cI did not laugh,\u201d because she was afraid. The Lord said, \u201cYes, you did laugh.\u201d", "16": "The men got up from there and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.

Will you really sweep them away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? ", "25": "You would never do such a thing, killing the righteous along with the wicked, treating the righteous the same as the wicked. You would never do such a thing. The Judge of all the earth should do right, shouldn't he?\u201d", "26": "The Lord said, \u201cIf I find fifty righteous people within the city of Sodom, then I will spare the entire place for their sake.\u201d", "27": "Abraham answered, \u201cSee now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it on myself to speak to my Lord.

What if thirty are found there?\u201d He said, \u201cI will not do it if I find thirty there.\u201d", "31": "He said, \u201cSee now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to my Lord. What if there are twenty found there?\u201d He said, \u201cI will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.\u201d", "32": "He said, \u201cPlease, do not be angry, my Lord, but I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?\u201d He said, \u201cI will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.\u201d", "33": "As soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, the Lord went on his way, and Abraham returned to his place."}

", "7": "It turned out that Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord killed him.", "8": "Then Judah said to Onan, \u201cGo to your brother's wife. Perform your duty for her as the brother of her deceased husband and provide offspring[a] for your brother.\u201d ", "9": "Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so whenever he went to his brother's wife, he wasted his semen on the ground, so that he would not provide offspring for his brother. ", "10": "But the thing that he did was evil in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord killed him also.", "11": "Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, \u201cRemain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah is grown up.\u201d Actually he had said to himself, \u201cI do not want him to die like his brothers.\u201d So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.", "12": "After some time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

", "16": "He turned to her by the roadside and said, \u201cPlease, let me come to you,\u201d because he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, \u201cWhat will you give me, so that you may come to me?\u201d", "17": "He said, \u201cI will send you a young goat from the flock.\u201d She said, \u201cWill you give me something as a security deposit until you send the goat?\u201d", "18": "He said, \u201cWhat should I give you as a deposit?\u201d She said, \u201cYour stamp seal on its cord and your staff that is in your hand.\u201d He gave them to her and went to her, and she conceived by him. ", "19": "Then she got up and left. Later she took off her veil and put her widow's garments back on.", "20": "Judah sent the young goat with his friend, the Adullamite, to get back the deposit from the woman's possession, but he could not find her.

Look, I did send this young goat, but you were unable to find her.\u201d", "24": "About three months later Judah was told, \u201cTamar, your daughter-in-law, has prostituted herself, and even worse, she is pregnant by prostitution.\u201d Judah said, \u201cBring her out and burn her.\u201d", "25": "When she was brought, she sent this message to her father-in-law: \u201cI am pregnant by the man to whom these things belong.\u201d She also said, \u201cPlease help me identify whose these are\u2014this stamp seal on its cord and the staff.\u201d", "26": "Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah, my son.\u201d But he was not intimate with her again.", "27": "When the time came for her to go into labor, it turned out that there were twins in her womb. ", "28": "When she was in labor, one of the twins put out a hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, \u201cThis one came out first.\u201d ", "29": "But then after he had pulled back his hand, his brother came out first, so she said, \u201cWhat a breakthrough you made for yourself!\u201d That is why he was named Perez.[b] ", "30": "Afterward his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand came out, so he was named Zerah.[c]"}

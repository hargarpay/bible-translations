Go down there and buy some for us there, so that we may live and not die.\u201d ", "3": "So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. ", "4": "But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin along with his other brothers, because he said, \u201cSomething bad might happen to him.\u201d", "5": "The sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain because of the famine in the land of Canaan. ", "6": "Joseph was the governor over the land. He was the one who sold grain to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. ", "7": "Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them. He asked them, \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d They said, \u201cFrom the land of Canaan to buy food.\u201d", "8": "Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. ", "9": "Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them and said to them, \u201cYou are spies! You have come to see where the land is exposed.\u201d", "10": "They said to him, \u201cNo, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. ", "11": "We are all one man's sons. We are honest men. Your servants are not spies.\u201d", "12": "He said to them, \u201cNo, you have come to see where the land is exposed!\u201d", "13": "They said, \u201cWe, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. Listen, at the present time the youngest remains with our father, and one is no more.\u201d", "14": "Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is just as I said. You are spies!

The rest of you will be kept under arrest, so that your words may be tested, whether you are telling the truth. Otherwise, by the life of Pharaoh, you are spies.\u201d ", "17": "He kept them all together, confined in the jail for three days.", "18": "On the third day Joseph said to them, \u201cDo what I tell you and you will live, because I fear God.

So all this was done for them.", "26": "They loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there. ", "27": "When one of them opened his sack at the lodging place to give his donkey food, he saw his money. It was right there in the mouth of his bag.

Look, there it is, in my bag!\u201d Their hearts sank, and they turned to one another trembling and said, \u201cWhat is this that God has done to us?\u201d", "29": "They came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him everything that had happened to them. They said, ", "30": "\u201cThe man, the Lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and accused us of being spies against the country. ", "31": "We said to him, 'We are honest men. We are not spies.

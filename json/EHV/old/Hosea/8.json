A vulture is circling over[a] the Lord's house, because they have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.", "2": "Israel cries out to me, \u201cMy God, we acknowledge[b] you!\u201d", "3": "But, in fact, Israel has rejected what is good. An enemy will pursue him.", "4": "They set up kings, but not with my approval. They installed officials, but I did not choose[c] them. From their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves, so they will be cut off.", "5": "I reject[d] your calf idol, Samaria! My anger burns against these people! How long will they be incapable of innocence?", "6": "That thing sitting there is from Israel! A craftsman made it, so it is not God.

Now among the nations they are like a pot no one wants.", "9": "For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey all by itself.

They will return to Egypt.", "14": "Israel has forgotten its Maker and built palaces.[f] Judah has multiplied its fortified cities, but I will send fire on its cities, which will devour its citadels."}

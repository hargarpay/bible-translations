They break out in violence, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.", "3": "Therefore the land mourns,[a] and everyone who dwells in it wastes away along with the wild animals and the birds in the sky. Even the fish of the sea have been removed.", "4": "Yet no one should bring charges. No one should accuse, because your people are like those who dispute with a priest.[b]", "5": "You will stumble by day, and the prophet will also stumble with you by night. I will also destroy your mother.", "6": "My people have been destroyed because of lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from serving as a priest for me.

How can the Lord feed them like a lamb in a meadow?", "17": "Ephraim is joined to idols.

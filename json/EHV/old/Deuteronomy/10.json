", "2": "Then I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first ones that you shattered, and you are to put them in the ark.\u201d", "3": "So I made an ark of acacia wood and I cut out two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. ", "4": "He wrote on the tablets the same writing as on the first tablets, the Ten Commandments[b] that the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the middle of the fire, on the day of the assembly. Then the Lord gave them to me. ", "5": "I turned and came back down the mountain, and I put the tablets in the ark that I had made. There they are kept, as the Lord commanded me to do.", "6": "The people of Israel traveled from Be'eroth Bene Ja'akan to Moserah. Aaron died there, and he was buried there, and Eleazar his son served as priest in his place. ", "7": "From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of gullies filled with water.", "8": "At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord and to serve him, and to pronounce a blessing in his name, as they do to this day. ", "9": "That is why Levi did not have an allotment of land and an inheritance with his brothers. The Lord himself is their inheritance, as the Lord your God promised him.", "10": "I had stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights like the first time, and the Lord listened to me again on this second occasion. The Lord agreed not to destroy you. ", "11": "So the Lord said to me, \u201cSet out and continue the journey at the head of the people, and they will enter and take possession of the land that I promised to give them with an oath to their fathers.\u201d", "12": "So now, Israel, what is the Lord your God asking of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, ", "13": "to keep the commandments of the Lord and his statutes that I am commanding you today for your own good.", "14": "Indeed, the heavens and the heaven of heavens,[c] the earth and everything that is on it\u2014these belong to the Lord your God. ", "15": "Still, the Lord attached himself to your fathers, loved them, and he chose their descendants after them (that's you!) from all peoples, as it is today.", "16": "So cut away the tough shell of your sinful nature,[d] and do not be stubborn any longer.", "17": "The Lord your God is God of Gods and Lord of Lords, the great God, the mighty one and the awesome one, who does not show favoritism and does not take a bribe. ", "18": "He carries out justice for the fatherless and widows. He loves the alien who dwells among you and gives him food and clothing. ", "19": "So you are to love the alien, because you were aliens in the land of Egypt.", "20": "Fear the Lord your God, serve him, cling to him, and take your oaths in his name.", "21": "He is your glory. He is your God, who performed for you these great and awesome things that your own eyes have seen.", "22": "When your fathers went down to Egypt, they numbered seventy people, but now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky."}

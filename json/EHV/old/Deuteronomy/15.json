He must not exact it from his neighbor or from his brother Israelite, because the Lord's release has been proclaimed. ", "3": "You may exact it from a foreigner, but your hand is to release whatever your brother Israelite owes you.[c]", "4": "However, there should be no poor people among you, because the Lord will greatly bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance for you to possess, ", "5": "if you obey the voice of the Lord your God by carefully carrying out all of this command that I am giving you today.

So as a result you have a harsh attitude toward your poor brother and do not give him anything. Then he will cry out to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin. ", "10": "Give freely to him, and do not feel resentful about giving to him, because on account of your giving, the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and whatever you put your hand to.

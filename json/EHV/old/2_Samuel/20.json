{"1": "A worthless troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjaminite, was present. He blew the ram's horn and said, \u201cWe have no share with David, and no inheritance with the son of Jesse. Every man to his own tent,[a] Israel!\u201d ", "2": "So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stuck with their king and accompanied him from the Jordan to Jerusalem.", "3": "David arrived at his palace in Jerusalem. The king took the ten concubines whom he had left to take care of the house and put them in a residence that was under guard. He provided for them but did not go to them anymore. They were confined until the day of their death\u2014a life of widowhood.", "4": "The king said to Amasa, \u201cYou have three days to bring all the men of Judah to me and to be here yourself.\u201d ", "5": "So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took longer than the time that David had set for him.", "6": "So David said to Abishai, \u201cNow Sheba son of Bikri will do more damage to us than Absalom. You take the soldiers of your lord. Pursue Sheba, so that he does not find fortified cities for himself, and we lose him.\u201d", "7": "So Joab's men, the Kerethites, the Pelethites, and all the elite troops followed Abishai. They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.", "8": "When they were by the large stone that is at Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his battle dress and had a belt with a sheathed dagger fastened around his waist. As he went forward, the dagger fell out.

", "10": "Amasa was not on guard against the dagger that was in Joab's other hand. With it Joab struck Amasa in the abdomen, and Amasa's intestines spilled out on the ground. It did not take another blow to kill him. Joab and his brother Abishai resumed their pursuit of Sheba son of Bikri. ", "11": "One of Joab's young officers stood beside Amasa. He said, \u201cWho favors Joab? Who is for David? Follow Joab.\u201d", "12": "Amasa was still wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. Someone saw that all the people were stopping when they came upon Amasa and saw him, so he dragged Amasa off the highway into the field and threw a garment over him. ", "13": "When Amasa was removed from the highway, everyone followed Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.", "14": "Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Ma'akah, and all the Berites[b] were gathered together and they followed him.", "15": "All the men who were with Joab besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Ma'akah. They constructed a siege ramp against the rampart of the city, and they started battering the wall to make it fall down.", "16": "A wise woman called out from the city, \u201cListen! Listen! Please tell Joab, 'Come here and let me speak to you.'\u201d ", "17": "He approached her, and the woman said, \u201cAre you Joab?\u201d He said, \u201cI am.\u201d She said to him, \u201cListen to the words of your servant.\u201d He said, \u201cI am listening.\u201d", "18": "She said, \u201cIn former times they always said, 'Let them ask in Abel.' That is how they settled things. ", "19": "I am one of the peaceful, faithful people of Israel. You are seeking to put to death a whole city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the inheritance of the Lord?\u201d", "20": "Joab answered, \u201cMay I be cursed, yes, cursed, if I am here to swallow up or destroy. ", "21": "That is not the case. The fact is, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name is Sheba son of Bikri, lifted up his hand against King David. Just give him up, and I will withdraw from the city.\u201d The woman said to Joab, \u201cCertainly! His head will be thrown over the wall to you.\u201d", "22": "So the woman went to all the people with her wisdom, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bikri and threw it to Joab. Then he blew the ram's horn, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab then returned to the king in Jerusalem.", "23": "Joab was over the whole army of Israel. Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites. ", "24": "Adoram was in charge of forced labor.

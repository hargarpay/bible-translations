Absalom would call out to every man who had a legal issue to bring before the king for judgment, and he would say, \u201cWhat city are you from?\u201d The person would say, \u201cYour servant is from such-and-such of the tribes of Israel.\u201d ", "3": "Absalom would say to him, \u201cYour claims are good and valid, but there is no one from the king to listen to you.\u201d ", "4": "Then Absalom would say, \u201cI wish someone would make me a judge in the land. Then everyone who has a legal issue or needs a judgment could come to me, and I would give him justice.\u201d", "5": "Whenever someone approached to bow down to him, he would reach out, take hold of him, and kiss him. ", "6": "Absalom acted this way to everyone of Israel who came to the king for judgment. In this way Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.", "7": "After four[a] years Absalom said to the king, \u201cPlease let me go to Hebron and fulfill my vow, which I have made to the Lord, ", "8": "because when I was at Geshur in Aram, your servant vowed, 'If the Lord will really return me to Jerusalem, I will serve the Lord.'\u201d", "9": "The king said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d So he set out and went to Hebron.", "10": "But Absalom sent agents throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, \u201cWhen you hear the sound of the ram's horn, you are to say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'\u201d ", "11": "Two hundred men from Jerusalem who had been invited went along with Absalom.

As they went up, they were weeping as they walked along.", "31": "David had been told, \u201cAhithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\u201d So David said, \u201cPlease, Lord, make the advice of Ahithophel foolish.\u201d", "32": "David arrived at the summit, where he worshipped God.[e] Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him. His robe was torn, and he had dirt on his head. ", "33": "David said to him, \u201cIf you cross over with me, you will become a burden to me. ", "34": "But if you return to the city and you say to Absalom, 'Let me be your servant, O King. In the past I was a servant of your father. Now I will be your servant,' then you can defeat the advice of Ahithophel for me. ", "35": "Are not Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, with you there? Tell every word that you hear in the house of the king to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests. ", "36": "Their two sons, Zadok's son Ahima'az and Abiathar's son Jonathan, are there with them. Through those two, the three of you will be able to send me every word that you hear.\u201d ", "37": "Hushai, the friend and advisor of David, went to the city, just as Absalom also was entering into Jerusalem."}

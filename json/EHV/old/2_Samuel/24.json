Then I will know how many there are.\u201d", "3": "Joab said to the king, \u201cThe Lord your God will make the people a hundred times larger, however many they may be, and the eyes of my lord the king will see it. But why does my lord the king have such a strong desire to do this?\u201d", "4": "But the word of the king overruled Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to register Israel.

He said, \u201cShall seven[a] years of famine in your land come upon you, or three months of fleeing with your enemies pursuing you, or three days of plague[b] in your land? Now consider this and decide what answer I should return to the one who sent me.\u201d", "14": "David said to Gad, \u201cThis puts me in a difficult position. Please!

Here are oxen for the burnt offering, as well as the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.

I will not offer to the Lord my God burnt offerings that I did not pay for.\u201d So David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.[c] ", "25": "He built an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings there. The Lord heard the requests for the land, and the plague was held back from Israel."}

{"1": "For the choir director. A psalm by David. The heavens tell about the glory of God. The expanse of the sky proclaims the work of his hands.", "2": "Day after day they pour out speech. Night after night they display knowledge.", "3": "They do not speak. They say no words. Their voice is not heard.[a]", "4": "Their voice[b] goes out into all the earth, and their word reaches the end of the world. God has pitched a tent for the sun in the heavens.", "5": "It comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy. It celebrates like a champion who has run his race.", "6": "It sets out from one end of the heavens. It runs until it reaches the other end. There is nowhere to hide from its heat.", "7": "The law[c] of the Lord is perfect. It revives the soul. The testimony of the Lord is trustworthy. It gives wisdom to the inexperienced.[d]", "8": "The precepts of the Lord are right. They give joy to the heart. The commandment of the Lord is bright. It gives light to the eyes.", "9": "The fear of the Lord is pure. It stands forever. The just decrees of the Lord are truth. They are altogether righteous.", "10": "They are more desirable than gold, even better than much pure gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the honeycomb.", "11": "Yes, by them your servant is warned. In keeping them there is great reward.", "12": "Who can recognize his own errors? Declare me innocent of hidden sins.", "13": "Restrain your servant also from deliberate sins. Do not let them rule over me. Then I will be blameless. Then I will be innocent of great rebellion.", "14": "May the speech from my mouth and the thoughts in my heart be pleasing to you, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer."}

Save me from bloodthirsty men.", "3": "Yes, look how they lie in ambush to take my life! Strong men gather against me, but it is not because I have rebelled, not because I have sinned, O Lord.", "4": "I am not guilty, yet they run to take up their positions against me. Rise up to meet me and see!", "5": "You, O Lord, God of Armies, the God of Israel, wake up and confront all the nations. Do not show mercy to all the wicked traitors. Interlude", "6": "They return at evening. They growl like dogs. They prowl around the city.", "7": "Look, they gush from their mouths. Their lips are swords, so they say, \u201cWho hears?\u201d", "8": "But you laugh at them, Lord. You scoff at all those nations.", "9": "O my Strength, I watch for you, because God is my high fortress.", "10": "My merciful God will go ahead of me.

Consume them till they are no more. Then they will know to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Interlude", "14": "They return at evening. They growl like dogs. They prowl around the city.", "15": "They wander about for food. If not satisfied, they howl.", "16": "But I will sing about your strength. In the morning I will shout about your mercy, because you are a high fortress for me, a refuge in the day of my distress.", "17": "O my Strength, to you I make music, because God is my high fortress, my merciful God."}

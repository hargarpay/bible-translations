{"1": "A maskil[a] by David. When he was in the cave.[b] A prayer. With my voice I cry out to the Lord. With my voice I call to the Lord for mercy.", "2": "I pour out my complaint before him. I tell my distress before him.", "3": "When my spirit grows faint within me, you are the one who knows my course. On the path where I walk they have hidden a snare for me.", "4": "Look to my right and see. There is no one who recognizes me. There is no escape for me. No one cares about my life.", "5": "I cry out to you, Lord. I say, \u201cYou are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.\u201d", "6": "Pay attention to my loud cry, because I am very weak. Rescue me from those who pursue me, because they are too strong for me.", "7": "Set me free from my prison, so I can give thanks to your name. Then the righteous will gather around me, because you have accomplished your purpose for me."}

{"1": "For the choir director. A psalm by David. How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?", "2": "How long must I experience worries in my soul, sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy tower over me?", "3": "Look at me. Answer me, O Lord my God. Give light to my eyes so I do not sleep in death,", "4": "so my enemy does not say, \u201cI have overcome him,\u201d so my foes do not rejoice when I fall.", "5": "But I trust in your mercy. My heart rejoices in your salvation.", "6": "I will sing to the Lord because he has accomplished his purpose for me."}

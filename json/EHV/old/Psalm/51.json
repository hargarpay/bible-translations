{"1": "Be gracious to me, God, according to your mercy. Erase my acts of rebellion according to the greatness of your compassion.", "2": "Scrub me clean from my guilt. Purify me from my sin.", "3": "For I admit my rebellious acts. My sin is always in front of me.", "4": "Against you, you only, have I sinned, and I have done this evil in your eyes. So you are justified when you sentence me. You are blameless when you judge.", "5": "Certainly, I was guilty when I was born. I was sinful when my mother conceived me.", "6": "Since you desire truth on the inside, in my hidden heart you teach me wisdom.", "7": "Remove my sin with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.", "8": "Let me hear joy and gladness. Let the bones you have crushed celebrate.", "9": "Hide your face from my sins. Erase all my guilty deeds.", "10": "Create in me a pure heart, O God. Renew an unwavering spirit within me.", "11": "Do not cast me from your presence. Do not take your Holy Spirit from me.", "12": "Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Sustain me with a willing spirit.", "13": "I will teach rebels your ways, and sinners will turn to you.", "14": "Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, the God who saves me. My tongue will shout for joy about your righteousness.", "15": "Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.", "16": "For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it. You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.", "17": "The sacrifices God wants are a broken spirit. A broken and crushed heart, O God, you will not despise.", "18": "As it pleases you, do good for Zion. Build up the walls of Jerusalem.", "19": "Then you will be pleased with righteous sacrifices, burnt offerings and whole offerings. Then bulls will be offered up on your altar."}

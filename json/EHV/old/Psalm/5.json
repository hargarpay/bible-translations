{"1": "For the choir director. For flutes. A psalm by David. Turn your ear to my words, O Lord. Understand me when I sigh.", "2": "Pay attention to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.", "3": "Lord, in the morning you hear my voice. In the morning I lay out my requests in front of you, and I watch for your answer.", "4": "For you are not a God who takes pleasure in evil. With you the wicked cannot dwell.", "5": "The arrogant cannot stand before your eyes. You hate all evildoers.", "6": "You put to death those who speak lies. The Lord is disgusted with bloodthirsty, deceitful men.", "7": "But as for me, by your great mercy I will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple with reverence for you.", "8": "Lord, lead me in your righteousness. Because of those who slander me, make your way straight before me.", "9": "Nothing reliable comes out of their mouth. From within them comes destruction. Their throat is an open grave. With their tongue they flatter.", "10": "Declare them guilty, O God! Let them fall because of their own schemes. For their many treacherous deeds banish them, because they have rebelled against you.", "11": "But let all who take refuge in you be glad. Let them sing for joy forever. You cover them with protection, so those who love your name rejoice in you.", "12": "Yes, you bless the righteous, Lord. You surround them with your favor as a shield."}

{"1": "A psalm by David. When he was in the wilderness of Judah.[a] God, you are my God. Eagerly I seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and dreary land without water.", "2": "Yes, in the sanctuary I have watched you to see your power and your glory.", "3": "Because your mercy is better than life, my lips will worship you.", "4": "Yes, I will bless you as long as I live. In your name I will lift up my hands.", "5": "My soul will be satisfied with rich food.[b] My mouth will praise you with lips filled with songs.", "6": "Whenever I remember you on my bed, throughout the watches of the night I meditate on you.", "7": "Because you are a help for me, I sing for joy under the shade of your wings.", "8": "My soul clings to you. Your right hand upholds me.", "9": "But those who seek my life will go to destruction. They will go into the depths of the earth.", "10": "They will be given over to the power of the sword. They will become food for foxes.[c]", "11": "But the king will rejoice in God. All who swear by him will praise him, but the mouths of those speaking lies will be shut."}

{"1": "O Lord, the God who saves me, by day I cry out. At night I cry before you.", "2": "May my prayer come before you. Turn your ear to my cry.", "3": "Indeed, my soul has had its fill of troubles, and my life has arrived at the grave.", "4": "I am treated like those who go down to the pit. I am like someone without strength.", "5": "I am turned loose with the dead. I am like the slain who lie in the grave, like the ones you do not remember anymore, like those who are cut off from your hand.", "6": "You have put me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the depths.", "7": "Your wrath presses against me. You have battered me with all your breakers. Interlude", "8": "You have distanced my acquaintances from me. You have made me repulsive to them.

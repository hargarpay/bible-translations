{"1": "A psalm by David. Lord, who may be a guest in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy mountain?", "2": "One who walks with integrity, who does what is righteous, and who speaks the truth in his heart.", "3": "He has no slander on his tongue. He does not harm his friend, and he does not defame his neighbor.", "4": "He despises everyone whom God rejects, but he honors those who fear the Lord. When he promises something, he does not break his word even though it costs him a lot.", "5": "He does not lend his money to get interest,[a] and he does not accept a bribe against the innocent. One who does these things will never be toppled."}

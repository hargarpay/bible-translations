{"1": "Judge me justly, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation. Rescue me from the deceitful, wicked man.", "2": "I know you are God, my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go around mourning because of oppression by the enemy?", "3": "Send out your light and your truth. Let them guide me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain, to your dwelling.", "4": "Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and gladness.

Hope in God, for I will again praise him for my salvation from the face of my God.[a]"}

{"1": "For the choir director. For Jeduthun.[a] A psalm by David. I said, \u201cI will guard my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue. I will keep a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are confronting me.\u201d", "2": "I said nothing. I kept silent. I did not even say anything good, but my pain became worse.", "3": "Inside me my heart grew hot. As I fretted, the fire burned. So I spoke with my tongue.", "4": "Lord, help me understand my end. What is the limit of my days? Let me know how fleeting I am.", "5": "See, you have cut short my days.[b] My brief time before you is like nothing. Indeed, every person, even at his best, is just a puff of air.[c] Interlude", "6": "A man flickers like a mirage. He really has no more effect than a breeze.[d] He piles things up, never knowing who will get them.", "7": "But now what do I wait for, Lord? My hope is in you.", "8": "Save me from all my rebellious acts. Do not let fools scorn me.", "9": "I said nothing. I did not open my mouth, because you are the one who caused this.", "10": "Stop punching me. By the attack of your hand I am finished.", "11": "By your rebuke against guilt you discipline a man. Like a moth you consume what he desires. Indeed, every person is nothing but a puff of air. Interlude", "12": "Hear my prayer, O Lord. Listen to my cry. Do not ignore my tears, for with you I am an alien, just a visitor, as were all my ancestors.", "13": "Look away from me, so I can smile again before I depart and am no more."}

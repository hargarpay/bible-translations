Why should the project stop while I leave it and come down to you?\u201d ", "4": "They sent messages like this to me four times, and I answered them that same way each time.", "5": "Then Sanballat sent his servant to me with a message like this for a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. ", "6": "In it was written, \u201cIt is rumored among the nations, and Gashmu[b] also says that you and the Jews are planning to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you will be their king. ", "7": "You have also set up prophets to make a proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'A king is in Judah.' Now reports like these will be heard by the king. So now come, let us consult with one another.\u201d", "8": "So I sent a reply to him: \u201cThese things that you are saying have not been done, since you are simply making them up.\u201d", "9": "So all of them were trying to intimidate us, thinking, \u201cTheir hands will grow weary of the work, and it will not be finished.\u201d So now, strengthen my hands!", "10": "Then I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel.

So he sent messengers and told them, \u201cGo, inquire of Baal Zebub,[a] the god of Ekron, whether I will survive this injury.\u201d", "3": "But an angel of the Lord said to Elijah from Tishbe, \u201cGet up. Go meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, 'Is there no God in Israel, so that you are going to seek out Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?

You will certainly die.'\u201d So Elijah went.", "5": "The messengers returned to the king, so he said to them, \u201cWhy have you come back?\u201d", "6": "They told him, \u201cA man came up to meet us and told us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him: This is what the Lord says. Is there no God in Israel, so that you are sending men to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, you will not get up from the bed you have gotten into.

He went up to him, and there Elijah was, sitting on top of a hill.

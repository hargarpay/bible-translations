When they came to the Jordan, they began to cut down trees. ", "5": "But while one of them was cutting down a tree for a beam, the ax fell into the water. He cried out, \u201cOh no, my lord! It was borrowed!\u201d", "6": "But the man of God said, \u201cWhere did it fall?\u201d Then he showed him the place. He cut off a piece of wood and threw it into the water, and the ax floated.", "7": "Then he said, \u201cPick it up.\u201d So he reached out his hand and took it.", "8": "Now when the king of Aram was waging war against Israel, he would make plans with his officials, saying, \u201cMy camp will be at such and such a place.\u201d", "9": "But the man of God would send a message to the king of Israel, saying, \u201cBe careful when you pass this place because the Arameans are going down there.\u201d ", "10": "So the king of Israel would send scouts to the place that the man of God had pointed out. So the man of God warned him, and he was kept safe\u2014and not just once or twice.", "11": "The king of Aram was enraged because of this. He summoned his officials and said to them, \u201cWon't you tell me who of us is for the king of Israel?\u201d", "12": "One of his officials said, \u201cNo, my lord the king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words which you speak in your bedroom.\u201d", "13": "Then he said, \u201cGo and see where he is. Then I'll send men and capture him.\u201d He was told, \u201cDothan is where he is.\u201d", "14": "So he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They came at night and surrounded the city. ", "15": "When the man of God's servant got up early and went out, there were soldiers, horses, and chariots surrounding the city. So his attendant said to Elisha, \u201cOh no, my lord! What will we do?\u201d", "16": "He answered, \u201cDon't be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\u201d", "17": "Then Elisha prayed and said, \u201cO Lord, open his eyes so that he can see.\u201d Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire, all around Elisha.", "18": "When the Arameans came down, Elisha prayed to the Lord, \u201cStrike these people with blindness.\u201d So he struck them with blindness, just as Elisha had asked.", "19": "Then Elisha said to them, \u201cThis is not the road, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are looking for.\u201d So he brought them to Samaria.

Shall I strike them down?\u201d", "22": "He said, \u201cDo not strike them down. Would you strike down a man you captured with your own sword and bow?[a] Set food and water before them so that they can eat and drink and then go back to their master.\u201d ", "23": "So he gave a great feast for them. They ate and drank. Then he sent them on their way, and they went to their master. The Aramean raiding parties did not come into the land of Israel anymore.", "24": "After these things, Ben Hadad king of Aram mobilized his whole army and went up and laid siege to Samaria. ", "25": "There was a severe famine in Samaria, because the siege lasted until a donkey head sold for eighty shekels[b] of silver and a cup of dove's droppings[c] for five shekels of silver.", "26": "When the king of Israel was walking on the wall, a woman cried out to him, \u201cHelp me, my lord the king!\u201d", "27": "But he said, \u201cIf the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?\u201d ", "28": "Then the king asked her, \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d She said, \u201cThis woman said to me, 'Come on, give up your son, and we will eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.' ", "29": "So we cooked my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, 'Give up your son so that we may eat him,' but she hid her son.\u201d", "30": "When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. As he was walking on the wall, the people were surprised to see that he was wearing sackcloth on his body, underneath his clothing.", "31": "Then he said, \u201cMay God punish me severely and even double it, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!\u201d", "32": "Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a man ahead of him. But before the messenger came to him, Elisha said to the elders, \u201cDo you see that this murderer has sent this man to cut off my head? When the messenger comes, shut the door and push against it. Isn't the sound of the feet of his master behind him?\u201d", "33": "While he was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him.

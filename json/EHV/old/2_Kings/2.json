Be quiet.\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to him, \u201cElisha, stay here because the Lord has sent me to Jericho.\u201d But he said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\u201d So they went to Jericho.", "5": "Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, \u201cDo you know that today the Lord is taking your master away from you?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I know.

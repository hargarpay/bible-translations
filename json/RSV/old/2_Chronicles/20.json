", "3": "Then Jehosh\u2032aphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. ", "4": "And Judah assembled to seek help from the Lord; from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.", "5": "And Jehosh\u2032aphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court, ", "6": "and said, \u201cO Lord, God of our fathers, art thou not God in heaven? Dost thou not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? In thy hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee. ", "7": "Didst thou not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it for ever to the descendants of Abraham thy friend? ", "8": "And they have dwelt in it, and have built thee in it a sanctuary for thy name, saying, ", "9": "'If evil comes upon us, the sword, judgment,[c] or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, for thy name is in this house, and cry to thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.'

", "17": "You will not need to fight in this battle; take your position, stand still, and see the victory of the Lord on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.' Fear not, and be not dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.\u201d", "18": "Then Jehosh\u2032aphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. ", "19": "And the Levites, of the Ko\u2032hathites and the Ko\u2032rahites, stood up to praise the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.", "20": "And they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Teko\u2032a; and as they went out, Jehosh\u2032aphat stood and said, \u201cHear me, Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be established; believe his prophets, and you will succeed.\u201d ", "21": "And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the Lord and praise him in holy array, as they went before the army, and say, \u201cGive thanks to the Lord, for his steadfast love endures for ever.\u201d And when they began to sing and praise, the Lord set an ambush against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Se\u2032ir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed. ", "23": "For the men of Ammon and Moab rose against the inhabitants of Mount Se\u2032ir, destroying them utterly, and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se\u2032ir, they all helped to destroy one another.", "24": "When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies lying on the ground; none had escaped. ", "25": "When Jehosh\u2032aphat and his people came to take the spoil from them, they found cattle[d] in great numbers, goods, clothing, and precious things, which they took for themselves until they could carry no more. They were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much. ", "26": "On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Ber\u2032acah,[e] for there they blessed the Lord; therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Ber\u2032acah to this day.

", "28": "They came to Jerusalem, with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the house of the Lord. ", "29": "And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel. ", "30": "So the realm of Jehosh\u2032aphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round about.", "31": "Thus Jehosh\u2032aphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azu\u2032bah the daughter of Shilhi.

", "36": "He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish, and they built the ships in E\u2032zion-ge\u2032ber. ", "37": "Then Elie\u2032zer the son of Dodav\u2032ahu of Mare\u2032shah prophesied against Jehosh\u2032aphat, saying, \u201cBecause you have joined with Ahazi\u2032ah, the Lord will destroy what you have made.\u201d And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish."}

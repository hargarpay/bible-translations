{"1": "And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahazi\u2032ah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older sons. So Ahazi\u2032ah the son of Jeho\u2032ram king of Judah reigned. ", "2": "Ahazi\u2032ah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athali\u2032ah, the granddaughter of Omri. ", "3": "He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly. ", "4": "He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done; for after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing. ", "5": "He even followed their counsel, and went with Jeho\u2032ram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Haz\u2032ael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram, ", "6": "and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Haz\u2032ael king of Syria. And Ahazi\u2032ah the son of Jeho\u2032ram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.", "7": "But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahazi\u2032ah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there he went out with Jeho\u2032ram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. ", "8": "And when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahazi\u2032ah's brothers, who attended Ahazi\u2032ah, and he killed them. ", "9": "He searched for Ahazi\u2032ah, and he was captured while hiding in Samar\u2032ia, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, \u201cHe is the grandson of Jehosh\u2032aphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart.\u201d And the house of Ahazi\u2032ah had no one able to rule the kingdom.", "10": "Now when Athali\u2032ah the mother of Ahazi\u2032ah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah.

Thus Jeho-shab\u2032e-ath, the daughter of King Jeho\u2032ram and wife of Jehoi\u2032ada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahazi\u2032ah, hid him from Athali\u2032ah, so that she did not slay him; ", "12": "and he remained with them six years, hid in the house of God, while Athali\u2032ah reigned over the land."}

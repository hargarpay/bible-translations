", "3": "And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.", "4": "When Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mor\u2032decai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. ", "5": "Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mor\u2032decai to learn what this was and why it was.

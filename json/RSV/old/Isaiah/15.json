{"1": "An oracle concerning Moab. Because Ar is laid waste in a night Moab is undone; because Kir is laid waste in a night Moab is undone.", "2": "The daughter of Dibon[a] has gone up to the high places to weep; over Nebo and over Med\u2032eba Moab wails. On every head is baldness, every beard is shorn;", "3": "in the streets they gird on sackcloth; on the housetops and in the squares every one wails and melts in tears.", "4": "Heshbon and Ele-a\u2032leh cry out, their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles.", "5": "My heart cries out for Moab; his fugitives flee to Zo\u2032ar, to Eg\u2032lath-shelish\u2032iyah. For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; on the road to Horona\u2032im they raise a cry of destruction;", "6": "the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the new growth fails, the verdure is no more.", "7": "Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Brook of the Willows.", "8": "For a cry has gone round the land of Moab; the wailing reaches to Egla\u2032im, the wailing reaches to Beer-e\u2032lim.", "9": "For the waters of Dibon[b] are full of blood; yet I will bring upon Dibon[c] even more, a lion for those of Moab who escape, for the remnant of the land."}

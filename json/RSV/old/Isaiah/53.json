{"1": "Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?", "2": "For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.", "3": "He was despised and rejected[a] by men; a man of sorrows,[b] and acquainted with grief;[c] and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.", "4": "Surely he has borne our griefs[d] and carried our sorrows;[e] yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.", "5": "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed.", "6": "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.", "7": "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.", "8": "By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?", "9": "And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.", "10": "Yet it was the will of the Lord to bruise him; he has put him to grief;[f] when he makes himself[g] an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand;", "11": "he shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities.", "12": "Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors."}

", "2": "The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the field of battle. ", "3": "And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, \u201cWhy has the Lord put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord here from Shiloh, that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.\u201d ", "4": "So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin\u2032ehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.", "5": "When the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded. ", "6": "And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, \u201cWhat does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?\u201d And when they learned that the ark of the Lord had come to the camp, ", "7": "the Philistines were afraid; for they said, \u201cA god has come into the camp.\u201d And they said, \u201cWoe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. ", "8": "Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.

", "11": "And the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin\u2032ehas, were slain.", "12": "A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.

And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out. ", "14": "When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, \u201cWhat is this uproar?\u201d Then the man hastened and came and told Eli.

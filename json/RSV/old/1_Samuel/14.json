{"1": "One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, \u201cCome, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on yonder side.\u201d But he did not tell his father. ", "2": "Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gib\u2032e-ah under the pomegranate tree which is at Migron; the people who were with him were about six hundred men, ", "3": "and Ahi\u2032jah the son of Ahi\u2032tub, Ich\u2032abod's brother, son of Phin\u2032ehas, son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. ", "4": "In the pass,[a] by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. ", "5": "The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.", "6": "And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, \u201cCome, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the Lord will work for us; for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving by many or by few.\u201d ", "7": "And his armor-bearer said to him, \u201cDo all that your mind inclines to;[b] behold, I am with you, as is your mind so is mine.\u201d[c] ", "8": "Then said Jonathan, \u201cBehold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. ", "9": "If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. ", "10": "But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up; for the Lord has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.\u201d ", "11": "So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, \u201cLook, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves.\u201d ", "12": "And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, \u201cCome up to us, and we will show you a thing.\u201d And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, \u201cCome up after me; for the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.\u201d ", "13": "Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him; ", "14": "and that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was of about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre[d] of land. ", "15": "And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.", "16": "And the watchmen of Saul in Gib\u2032e-ah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude was surging hither and thither.[e] ", "17": "Then Saul said to the people who were with him, \u201cNumber and see who has gone from us.\u201d And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. ", "18": "And Saul said to Ahi\u2032jah, \u201cBring hither the ark of God.\u201d For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel. ", "19": "And while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, \u201cWithdraw your hand.\u201d ", "20": "Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. ", "21": "Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with[f] the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. ", "22": "Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of E\u2032phraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. ", "23": "So the Lord delivered Israel that day; and the battle passed beyond Beth-a\u2032ven.", "24": "And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul laid an oath on the people, saying, \u201cCursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.\u201d So none of the people tasted food. ", "25": "And all the people[g] came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground. ", "26": "And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath. ", "27": "But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; so he put forth the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes became bright. ", "28": "Then one of the people said, \u201cYour father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food this day.'\u201d And the people were faint. ", "29": "Then Jonathan said, \u201cMy father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have become bright, because I tasted a little of this honey. ", "30": "How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.\u201d", "31": "They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ai\u2032jalon. And the people were very faint; ", "32": "the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood. ", "33": "Then they told Saul, \u201cBehold, the people are sinning against the Lord, by eating with the blood.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.\u201d[h] ", "34": "And Saul said, \u201cDisperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, 'Let every man bring his ox or his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood.'\u201d So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slew them there. ", "35": "And Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first altar that he built to the Lord.", "36": "Then Saul said, \u201cLet us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.\u201d And they said, \u201cDo whatever seems good to you.\u201d But the priest said, \u201cLet us draw near hither to God.\u201d ", "37": "And Saul inquired of God, \u201cShall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel?\u201d But he did not answer him that day. ", "38": "And Saul said, \u201cCome hither, all you leaders of the people; and know and see how this sin has arisen today. ", "39": "For as the Lord lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.\u201d But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. ", "40": "Then he said to all Israel, \u201cYou shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.\u201d And the people said to Saul, \u201cDo what seems good to you.\u201d ", "41": "Therefore Saul said, \u201cO Lord God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O Lord, God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in thy people Israel,[i] give Thummim.\u201d And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped. ", "42": "Then Saul said, \u201cCast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.\u201d And Jonathan was taken.", "43": "Then Saul said to Jonathan, \u201cTell me what you have done.\u201d And Jonathan told him, \u201cI tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die.\u201d ", "44": "And Saul said, \u201cGod do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.\u201d ", "45": "Then the people said to Saul, \u201cShall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the Lord lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day.\u201d So the people ransomed Jonathan, that he did not die. ", "46": "Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.", "47": "When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he put them to the worse. ", "48": "And he did valiantly, and smote the Amal\u2032ekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.", "49": "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Mal\u2032chishu\u2032a; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal; ", "50": "and the name of Saul's wife was Ahin\u2032o-am the daughter of Ahim\u2032a-az. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle; ", "51": "Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abi\u2032el.", "52": "There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself."}

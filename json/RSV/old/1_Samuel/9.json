{"1": "There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abi\u2032el, son of Zeror, son of Beco\u2032rath, son of Aphi\u2032ah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth; ", "2": "and he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; from his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.", "3": "Now the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, \u201cTake one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the asses.\u201d ", "4": "And they[a] passed through the hill country of E\u2032phraim and passed through the land of Shal\u2032ishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Sha\u2032alim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.", "5": "When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, \u201cCome, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the asses and become anxious about us.\u201d ", "6": "But he said to him, \u201cBehold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he says comes true. Let us go there; perhaps he can tell us about the journey on which we have set out.\u201d ", "7": "Then Saul said to his servant, \u201cBut if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What have we?\u201d ", "8": "The servant answered Saul again, \u201cHere, I have with me the fourth part of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God, to tell us our way.\u201d ", "9": "(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, \u201cCome, let us go to the seer\u201d; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.) ", "10": "And Saul said to his servant, \u201cWell said; come, let us go.\u201d So they went to the city where the man of God was.", "11": "As they went up the hill to the city, they met young maidens coming out to draw water, and said to them, \u201cIs the seer here?\u201d ", "12": "They answered, \u201cHe is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Make haste; he has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place. ", "13": "As soon as you enter the city, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those eat who are invited. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately.\u201d ", "14": "So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.", "15": "Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed to Samuel: ", "16": "\u201cTomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of Philistines; for I have seen the affliction of[b] my people, because their cry has come to me.\u201d ", "17": "When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told him, \u201cHere is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall rule over my people.\u201d ", "18": "Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate, and said, \u201cTell me where is the house of the seer?\u201d ", "19": "Samuel answered Saul, \u201cI am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind. ", "20": "As for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's house?\u201d ", "21": "Saul answered, \u201cAm I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?\u201d", "22": "Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons. ", "23": "And Samuel said to the cook, \u201cBring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, 'Put it aside.'\u201d ", "24": "So the cook took up the leg and the upper portion[c] and set them before Saul; and Samuel said, \u201cSee, what was kept is set before you. Eat; because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests.\u201d[d] So Saul ate with Samuel that day. ", "25": "And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul[e] upon the roof, and he lay down to sleep. ", "26": "Then at the break of dawn[f] Samuel called to Saul upon the roof, \u201cUp, that I may send you on your way.\u201d So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.", "27": "As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, \u201cTell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God.\u201d"}

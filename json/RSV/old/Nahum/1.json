His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.", "4": "He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither, the bloom of Lebanon fades.", "5": "The mountains quake before him, the hills melt; the earth is laid waste before him, the world and all that dwell therein.", "6": "Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.", "7": "The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him.", "8": "But with an overflowing flood he will make a full end of his adversaries,[a] and will pursue his enemies into darkness.", "9": "What do you plot against the Lord?

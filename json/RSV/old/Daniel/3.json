{"1": "King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. ", "2": "Then King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar had set up. ", "3": "Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnez\u2032zar had set up. ", "4": "And the herald proclaimed aloud, \u201cYou are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, ", "5": "that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar has set up; ", "6": "and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace.\u201d ", "7": "Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image which King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar had set up.", "8": "Therefore at that time certain Chalde\u2032ans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews. ", "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar, \u201cO king, live for ever!

These men, O king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.\u201d", "13": "Then Nebuchadnez\u2032zar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego be brought. Then they brought these men before the king.

", "15": "Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?\u201d", "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego answered the king, \u201cO Nebuchadnez\u2032zar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. ", "17": "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.[a] ", "18": "But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.\u201d", "19": "Then Nebuchadnez\u2032zar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

", "21": "Then these men were bound in their mantles,[b] their tunics,[c] their hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning fiery furnace. ", "22": "Because the king's order was strict and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego. ", "23": "And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.", "24": "Then King Nebuchadnez\u2032zar was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counselors, \u201cDid we not cast three men bound into the fire?\u201d They answered the king, \u201cTrue, O king.\u201d ", "25": "He answered, \u201cBut I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.\u201d", "26": "Then Nebuchadnez\u2032zar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace and said, \u201cShadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego, servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here!\u201d Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego came out from the fire.

", "28": "Nebuchadnez\u2032zar said, \u201cBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set at nought the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. ", "29": "Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.\u201d ", "30": "Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed\u2032nego in the province of Babylon."}

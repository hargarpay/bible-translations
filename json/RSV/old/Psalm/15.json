{"1": "O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tent? Who shall dwell on thy holy hill?", "2": "He who walks blamelessly, and does what is right, and speaks truth from his heart;", "3": "who does not slander with his tongue, and does no evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;", "4": "in whose eyes a reprobate is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord; who swears to his own hurt and does not change;", "5": "who does not put out his money at interest, and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved."}

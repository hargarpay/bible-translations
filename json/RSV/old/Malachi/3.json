", "4": "Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years.", "5": "\u201cThen I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the Lord of hosts.", "6": "\u201cFor I the Lord do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.

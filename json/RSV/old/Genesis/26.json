", "3": "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will fulfil the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. ", "4": "I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give to your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves: ", "5": "because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\u201d", "6": "So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. ", "7": "When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, \u201cShe is my sister\u201d; for he feared to say, \u201cMy wife,\u201d thinking, \u201clest the men of the place should kill me for the sake of Rebekah\u201d; because she was fair to look upon.

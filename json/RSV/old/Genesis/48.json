", "2": "And it was told to Jacob, \u201cYour son Joseph has come to you\u201d; then Israel summoned his strength, and sat up in bed. ", "3": "And Jacob said to Joseph, \u201cGod Almighty[a] appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, ", "4": "and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.' ", "5": "And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; E\u2032phraim and Manas\u2032seh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. ", "6": "And the offspring born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. ", "7": "For when I came from Paddan, Rachel to my sorrow died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).\u201d", "8": "When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, \u201cWho are these?\u201d ", "9": "Joseph said to his father, \u201cThey are my sons, whom God has given me here.\u201d And he said, \u201cBring them to me, I pray you, that I may bless them.\u201d ", "10": "Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them.

", "13": "And Joseph took them both, E\u2032phraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manas\u2032seh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him. ", "14": "And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of E\u2032phraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manas\u2032seh, crossing his hands, for Manas\u2032seh was the first-born.

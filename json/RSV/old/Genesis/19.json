{"1": "The two angels came to Sodom in the evening; and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed himself with his face to the earth, ", "2": "and said, \u201cMy lords, turn aside, I pray you, to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise up early and go on your way.\u201d They said, \u201cNo; we will spend the night in the street.\u201d ", "3": "But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. ", "4": "But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house; ", "5": "and they called to Lot, \u201cWhere are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.\u201d ", "6": "Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him, ", "7": "and said, \u201cI beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. ", "8": "Behold, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.\u201d ", "9": "But they said, \u201cStand back!\u201d And they said, \u201cThis fellow came to sojourn, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.\u201d Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door. ", "10": "But the men put forth their hands and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. ", "11": "And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves groping for the door.", "12": "Then the men said to Lot, \u201cHave you any one else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any one you have in the city, bring them out of the place; ", "13": "for we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.\u201d ", "14": "So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, \u201cUp, get out of this place; for the Lord is about to destroy the city.\u201d But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.", "15": "When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, \u201cArise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.\u201d ", "16": "But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him forth and set him outside the city. ", "17": "And when they had brought them forth, they[a] said, \u201cFlee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley; flee to the hills, lest you be consumed.\u201d ", "18": "And Lot said to them, \u201cOh, no, my lords; ", "19": "behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die.

Let me escape there\u2014is it not a little one?\u2014and my life will be saved!\u201d ", "21": "He said to him, \u201cBehold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. ", "22": "Make haste, escape there; for I can do nothing till you arrive there.\u201d Therefore the name of the city was called Zo\u2032ar.[b] ", "23": "The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zo\u2032ar.", "24": "Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomor\u2032rah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; ", "25": "and he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. ", "26": "But Lot's wife behind him looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. ", "27": "And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord; ", "28": "and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomor\u2032rah and toward all the land of the valley, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.", "29": "So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.", "30": "Now Lot went up out of Zo\u2032ar, and dwelt in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to dwell in Zo\u2032ar; so he dwelt in a cave with his two daughters.

", "32": "Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.\u201d ", "33": "So they made their father drink wine that night; and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. ", "34": "And on the next day, the first-born said to the younger, \u201cBehold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.\u201d ", "35": "So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. ", "36": "Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. ", "37": "The first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. ", "38": "The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day."}

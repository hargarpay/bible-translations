", "3": "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their asses. ", "4": "When they had gone but a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, \u201cUp, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup?[a] ", "5": "Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he divines? You have done wrong in so doing.'\u201d", "6": "When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. ", "7": "They said to him, \u201cWhy does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! ", "8": "Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then should we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?

", "15": "Joseph said to them, \u201cWhat deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?\u201d ", "16": "And Judah said, \u201cWhat shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.\u201d ", "17": "But he said, \u201cFar be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.\u201d", "18": "Then Judah went up to him and said, \u201cO my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself.

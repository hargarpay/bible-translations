Tell me; what have you in the house?\u201d And she said, \u201cYour maidservant has nothing in the house, except a jar of oil.\u201d ", "3": "Then he said, \u201cGo outside, borrow vessels of all your neighbors, empty vessels and not too few. ", "4": "Then go in, and shut the door upon yourself and your sons, and pour into all these vessels; and when one is full, set it aside.\u201d ", "5": "So she went from him and shut the door upon herself and her sons; and as she poured they brought the vessels to her. ", "6": "When the vessels were full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another vessel.\u201d And he said to her, \u201cThere is not another.\u201d Then the oil stopped flowing.

Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?\u201d She answered, \u201cI dwell among my own people.\u201d ", "14": "And he said, \u201cWhat then is to be done for her?\u201d Geha\u2032zi answered, \u201cWell, she has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d ", "15": "He said, \u201cCall her.\u201d And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway.

", "22": "Then she called to her husband, and said, \u201cSend me one of the servants and one of the asses, that I may quickly go to the man of God, and come back again.\u201d ", "23": "And he said, \u201cWhy will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath.\u201d She said, \u201cIt will be well.\u201d ", "24": "Then she saddled the ass, and she said to her servant, \u201cUrge the beast on; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Geha\u2032zi his servant, \u201cLook, yonder is the Shu\u2032nammite; ", "26": "run at once to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?\u201d And she answered, \u201cIt is well.\u201d ", "27": "And when she came to the mountain to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. And Geha\u2032zi came to thrust her away. But the man of God said, \u201cLet her alone, for she is in bitter distress; and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told me.\u201d ", "28": "Then she said, \u201cDid I ask my lord for a son?

If you meet any one, do not salute him; and if any one salutes you, do not reply; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.\u201d ", "30": "Then the mother of the child said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.\u201d So he arose and followed her.

", "35": "Then he got up again, and walked once to and fro in the house, and went up, and stretched himself upon him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. ", "36": "Then he summoned Geha\u2032zi and said, \u201cCall this Shu\u2032nammite.\u201d So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, \u201cTake up your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took up her son and went out.", "38": "And Eli\u2032sha came again to Gilgal when there was a famine in the land.

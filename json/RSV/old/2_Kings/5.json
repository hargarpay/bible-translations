{"1": "Na\u2032aman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. ", "2": "Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little maid from the land of Israel, and she waited on Na\u2032aman's wife. ", "3": "She said to her mistress, \u201cWould that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samar\u2032ia! He would cure him of his leprosy.\u201d ", "4": "So Na\u2032aman went in and told his lord, \u201cThus and so spoke the maiden from the land of Israel.\u201d ", "5": "And the king of Syria said, \u201cGo now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\u201d So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten festal garments. ", "6": "And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, \u201cWhen this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Na\u2032aman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy.\u201d ", "7": "And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, \u201cAm I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.\u201d", "8": "But when Eli\u2032sha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, \u201cWhy have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.\u201d ", "9": "So Na\u2032aman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the door of Eli\u2032sha's house. ", "10": "And Eli\u2032sha sent a messenger to him, saying, \u201cGo and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.\u201d ", "11": "But Na\u2032aman was angry, and went away, saying, \u201cBehold, I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper. ", "12": "Are not Aba\u2032na[a] and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?\u201d So he turned and went away in a rage. ", "13": "But his servants came near and said to him, \u201cMy father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather, then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean'?\u201d ", "14": "So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.", "15": "Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him; and he said, \u201cBehold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from your servant.\u201d ", "16": "But he said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will receive none.\u201d And he urged him to take it, but he refused. ", "17": "Then Na\u2032aman said, \u201cIf not, I pray you, let there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the Lord. ", "18": "In this matter may the Lord pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon your servant in this matter.\u201d ", "19": "He said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d But when Na\u2032aman had gone from him a short distance, ", "20": "Geha\u2032zi, the servant of Eli\u2032sha the man of God, said, \u201cSee, my master has spared this Na\u2032aman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him, and get something from him.\u201d ", "21": "So Geha\u2032zi followed Na\u2032aman. And when Na\u2032aman saw some one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, \u201cIs all well?\u201d ", "22": "And he said, \u201cAll is well. My master has sent me to say, 'There have just now come to me from the hill country of E\u2032phraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and two festal garments.'\u201d ", "23": "And Na\u2032aman said, \u201cBe pleased to accept two talents.\u201d And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two festal garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they carried them before Geha\u2032zi. ", "24": "And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed. ", "25": "He went in, and stood before his master, and Eli\u2032sha said to him, \u201cWhere have you been, Geha\u2032zi?\u201d And he said, \u201cYour servant went nowhere.\u201d ", "26": "But he said to him, \u201cDid I not go with you in spirit when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants? ", "27": "Therefore the leprosy of Na\u2032aman shall cleave to you, and to your descendants for ever.\u201d So he went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow."}

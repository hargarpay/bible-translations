", "5": "Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil; he placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig, ", "6": "and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches and put forth foliage.", "7": "\u201cBut there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him that he might water it. From the bed where it was planted ", "8": "he transplanted it[a] to good soil by abundant waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a noble vine. ", "9": "Say, Thus says the Lord God: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its branches,[b] so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots. ", "10": "Behold, when it is transplanted, will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it\u2014wither away on the bed where it grew?\u201d", "11": "Then the word of the Lord came to me: ", "12": "\u201cSay now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean?

(The chief men of the land he had taken away, ", "14": "that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and that by keeping his covenant it might stand.) ", "15": "But he rebelled against him by sending ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can a man escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?

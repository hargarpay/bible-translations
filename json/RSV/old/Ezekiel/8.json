{"1": "In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me. ", "2": "Then I beheld, and lo, a form that had the appearance of a man;[a] below what appeared to be his loins it was fire, and above his loins it was like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming bronze. ", "3": "He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. ", "4": "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.", "5": "Then he said to me, \u201cSon of man, lift up your eyes now in the direction of the north.\u201d So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy. ", "6": "And he said to me, \u201cSon of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.\u201d", "7": "And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall. ", "8": "Then said he to me, \u201cSon of man, dig in the wall\u201d; and when I dug in the wall, lo, there was a door. ", "9": "And he said to me, \u201cGo in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here.\u201d ", "10": "So I went in and saw; and there, portrayed upon the wall round about, were all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel. ", "11": "And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Ja-azani\u2032ah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up. ", "12": "Then he said to me, \u201cSon of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his room[b] of pictures? For they say, 'The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land.'\u201d ", "13": "He said also to me, \u201cYou will see still greater abominations which they commit.\u201d", "14": "Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. ", "15": "Then he said to me, \u201cHave you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these.\u201d", "16": "And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord; and behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east. ", "17": "Then he said to me, \u201cHave you seen this, O son of man? Is it too slight a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence, and provoke me further to anger? Lo, they put the branch to their nose. ", "18": "Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.\u201d"}

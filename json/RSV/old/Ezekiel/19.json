{"1": "And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, ", "2": "and say: What a lioness was your mother among lions! She couched in the midst of young lions, rearing her whelps.", "3": "And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.", "4": "The nations sounded an alarm against him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.", "5": "When she saw that she was baffled,[a] that her hope was lost, she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion.", "6": "He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.", "7": "And he ravaged their strongholds,[b] and laid waste their cities; and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring.", "8": "Then the nations set against him snares[c] on every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.", "9": "With hooks they put him in a cage, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.", "10": "Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard[d] transplanted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.", "11": "Its strongest stem became a ruler's scepter; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.", "12": "But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried it up; its fruit was stripped off, its strong stem was withered; the fire consumed it.", "13": "Now it is transplanted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.", "14": "And fire has gone out from its stem, has consumed its branches and fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for a ruler. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation."}

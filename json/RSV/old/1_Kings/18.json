And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. ", "33": "And he put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, \u201cFill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.\u201d ", "34": "And he said, \u201cDo it a second time\u201d; and they did it a second time.

", "39": "And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, \u201cThe Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God.\u201d ", "40": "And Eli\u2032jah said to them, \u201cSeize the prophets of Ba\u2032al; let not one of them escape.\u201d And they seized them; and Eli\u2032jah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.", "41": "And Eli\u2032jah said to Ahab, \u201cGo up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.\u201d ", "42": "So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Eli\u2032jah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.

And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. ", "46": "And the hand of the Lord was on Eli\u2032jah; and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."}

For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for today I perceive that if Ab\u2032salom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased. ", "7": "Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants; for I swear by the Lord, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night; and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.\u201d ", "8": "Then the king arose, and took his seat in the gate. And the people were all told, \u201cBehold, the king is sitting in the gate\u201d; and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his own home.

Shall any one be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?\u201d ", "23": "And the king said to Shim\u2032e-i, \u201cYou shall not die.\u201d And the king gave him his oath.", "24": "And Mephib\u2032osheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety.

What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?\u201d ", "29": "And the king said to him, \u201cWhy speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.\u201d ", "30": "And Mephib\u2032osheth said to the king, \u201cOh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home.\u201d", "31": "Now Barzil\u2032lai the Gileadite had come down from Ro\u2032gelim; and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan.

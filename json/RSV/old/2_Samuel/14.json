{"1": "Now Jo\u2032ab the son of Zeru\u2032iah perceived that the king's heart went out to Ab\u2032salom. ", "2": "And Jo\u2032ab sent to Teko\u2032a, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, \u201cPretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments; do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead; ", "3": "and go to the king, and speak thus to him.\u201d So Jo\u2032ab put the words in her mouth.", "4": "When the woman of Teko\u2032a came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, \u201cHelp, O king.\u201d ", "5": "And the king said to her, \u201cWhat is your trouble?\u201d She answered, \u201cAlas, I am a widow; my husband is dead. ", "6": "And your handmaid had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field; there was no one to part them, and one struck the other and killed him. ", "7": "And now the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, 'Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew'; and so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the face of the earth.\u201d", "8": "Then the king said to the woman, \u201cGo to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.\u201d ", "9": "And the woman of Teko\u2032a said to the king, \u201cOn me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.\u201d ", "10": "The king said, \u201cIf any one says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.\u201d ", "11": "Then she said, \u201cPray let the king invoke the Lord your God, that the avenger of blood slay no more, and my son be not destroyed.\u201d He said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.\u201d", "12": "Then the woman said, \u201cPray let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.\u201d He said, \u201cSpeak.\u201d ", "13": "And the woman said, \u201cWhy then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again. ", "14": "We must all die, we are like water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; but God will not take away the life of him who devises[a] means not to keep his banished one an outcast. ", "15": "Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid; and your handmaid thought, 'I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. ", "16": "For the king will hear, and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.' ", "17": "And your handmaid thought, 'The word of my lord the king will set me at rest'; for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The Lord your God be with you!\u201d", "18": "Then the king answered the woman, \u201cDo not hide from me anything I ask you.\u201d And the woman said, \u201cLet my lord the king speak.\u201d ", "19": "The king said, \u201cIs the hand of Jo\u2032ab with you in all this?\u201d The woman answered and said, \u201cAs surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Jo\u2032ab who bade me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid. ", "20": "In order to change the course of affairs your servant Jo\u2032ab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.\u201d", "21": "Then the king said to Jo\u2032ab, \u201cBehold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Ab\u2032salom.\u201d ", "22": "And Jo\u2032ab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king; and Jo\u2032ab said, \u201cToday your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.\u201d ", "23": "So Jo\u2032ab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Ab\u2032salom to Jerusalem. ", "24": "And the king said, \u201cLet him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence.\u201d So Ab\u2032salom dwelt apart in his own house, and did not come into the king's presence.", "25": "Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his beauty as Ab\u2032salom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. ", "26": "And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight. ", "27": "There were born to Ab\u2032salom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.", "28": "So Ab\u2032salom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence. ", "29": "Then Ab\u2032salom sent for Jo\u2032ab, to send him to the king; but Jo\u2032ab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Jo\u2032ab would not come. ", "30": "Then he said to his servants, \u201cSee, Jo\u2032ab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.\u201d So Ab\u2032salom's servants set the field on fire. ", "31": "Then Jo\u2032ab arose and went to Ab\u2032salom at his house, and said to him, \u201cWhy have your servants set my field on fire?\u201d ", "32": "Ab\u2032salom answered Jo\u2032ab, \u201cBehold, I sent word to you, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, \u201cWhy have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.\u201d Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king; and if there is guilt in me, let him kill me.'\u201d ", "33": "Then Jo\u2032ab went to the king, and told him; and he summoned Ab\u2032salom. So he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Ab\u2032salom."}

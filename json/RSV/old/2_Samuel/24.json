So Jo\u2032ab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel. ", "5": "They crossed the Jordan, and began from Aro\u2032er,[b] and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer.

And David said to the Lord, \u201cI have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O Lord, I pray thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.\u201d ", "11": "And when David arose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, ", "12": "\u201cGo and say to David, 'Thus says the Lord, Three things I offer[e] you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'\u201d ", "13": "So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, \u201cShall three[f] years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.\u201d ", "14": "Then David said to Gad, \u201cI am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.\u201d", "15": "So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time; and there died of the people from Dan to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.

Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's house.\u201d", "18": "And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, \u201cGo up, rear an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Arau\u2032nah the Jeb\u2032usite.\u201d ", "19": "So David went up at Gad's word, as the Lord commanded.

{"1": "And the Lord sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, \u201cThere were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. ", "2": "The rich man had very many flocks and herds; ", "3": "but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his morsel, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him. ", "4": "Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.\u201d ", "5": "Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, \u201cAs the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die; ", "6": "and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.\u201d", "7": "Nathan said to David, \u201cYou are the man. Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul; ", "8": "and I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. ", "9": "Why have you despised the word of the Lord, to do what is evil in his sight? You have smitten Uri\u2032ah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites. ", "10": "Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uri\u2032ah the Hittite to be your wife.' ", "11": "Thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. ", "12": "For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'\u201d ", "13": "David said to Nathan, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord.\u201d And Nathan said to David, \u201cThe Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. ", "14": "Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord,[a] the child that is born to you shall die.\u201d ", "15": "Then Nathan went to his house. And the Lord struck the child that Uri\u2032ah's wife bore to David, and it became sick. ", "16": "David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground. ", "17": "And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. ", "18": "On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, \u201cBehold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us; how then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.\u201d ", "19": "But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, \u201cIs the child dead?\u201d They said, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d ", "20": "Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord, and worshiped; he then went to his own house; and when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. ", "21": "Then his servants said to him, \u201cWhat is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.\u201d ", "22": "He said, \u201cWhile the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' ", "23": "But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.\u201d", "24": "Then David comforted his wife, Bathshe\u2032ba, and went in to her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the Lord loved him, ", "25": "and sent a message by Nathan the prophet; so he called his name Jedidi\u2032ah,[b] because of the Lord.", "26": "Now Jo\u2032ab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and took the royal city. ", "27": "And Jo\u2032ab sent messengers to David, and said, \u201cI have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. ", "28": "Now, then, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.\u201d ", "29": "So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it. ", "30": "And he took the crown of their king[c] from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount. ", "31": "And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them toil at[d] the brickkilns; and thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."}

{"1": "when I would heal Israel, the corruption of E\u2032phraim is revealed, and the wicked deeds of Samar\u2032ia; for they deal falsely, the thief breaks in, and the bandits raid without.", "2": "But they do not consider that I remember all their evil works. Now their deeds encompass them, they are before my face.", "3": "By their wickedness they make the king glad, and the princes by their treachery.", "4": "They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven, whose baker ceases to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.", "5": "On the day of our king the princes became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.", "6": "For like an oven their hearts burn[a] with intrigue; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.", "7": "All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen; and none of them calls upon me.", "8": "E\u2032phraim mixes himself with the peoples; E\u2032phraim is a cake not turned.", "9": "Aliens devour his strength, and he knows it not; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knows it not.", "10": "The pride of Israel witnesses against him; yet they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek him, for all this.", "11": "E\u2032phraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria.", "12": "As they go, I will spread over them my net; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will chastise them for their wicked deeds.[b]", "13": "Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!

I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.", "14": "They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; for grain and wine they gash themselves, they rebel against me.", "15": "Although I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they devise evil against me.", "16": "They turn to Ba\u2032al;[c] they are like a treacherous bow, their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."}

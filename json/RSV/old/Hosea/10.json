{"1": "Israel is a luxuriant vine that yields its fruit. The more his fruit increased the more altars he built; as his country improved he improved his pillars.", "2": "Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. The Lord[a] will break down their altars, and destroy their pillars.", "3": "For now they will say: \u201cWe have no king, for we fear not the Lord, and a king, what could he do for us?\u201d", "4": "They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants; so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.", "5": "The inhabitants of Samar\u2032ia tremble for the calf[b] of Beth-a\u2032ven. Its people shall mourn for it, and its idolatrous priests shall wail[c] over it, over its glory which has departed from it.", "6": "Yea, the thing itself shall be carried to Assyria, as tribute to the great king.[d] E\u2032phraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.[e]", "7": "Samar\u2032ia's king shall perish, like a chip on the face of the waters.", "8": "The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall upon us.", "9": "From the days of Gib\u2032e-ah, you have sinned, O Israel; there they have continued. Shall not war overtake them in Gib\u2032e-ah?", "10": "I will come[f] against the wayward people to chastise them; and nations shall be gathered against them when they are chastised[g] for their double iniquity.", "11": "E\u2032phraim was a trained heifer that loved to thresh, and I spared her fair neck; but I will put E\u2032phraim to the yoke, Judah must plow, Jacob must harrow for himself.", "12": "Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruit[h] of steadfast love; break up your fallow ground, for it is the time to seek the Lord, that he may come and rain salvation upon you.", "13": "You have plowed iniquity, you have reaped injustice, you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your chariots[i] and in the multitude of your warriors,", "14": "therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-ar\u2032bel on the day of battle; mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.", "15": "Thus it shall be done to you, O house of Israel,[j] because of your great wickedness. In the storm[k] the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off."}

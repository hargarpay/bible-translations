", "4": "And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. ", "5": "So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.", "6": "The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; ", "7": "and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, \u201cGet up quickly.\u201d And the chains fell off his hands.

", "3": "Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. ", "4": "And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, \u201cSaul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\u201d ", "5": "And he said, \u201cWho are you, Lord?\u201d And he said, \u201cI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; ", "6": "but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.\u201d ", "7": "The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. ", "8": "Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. ", "9": "And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.", "10": "Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Anani\u2032as.

", "27": "But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. ", "28": "So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, ", "29": "preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him. ", "30": "And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesare\u2032a, and sent him off to Tarsus.", "31": "So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samar\u2032ia had peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied.", "32": "Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda.

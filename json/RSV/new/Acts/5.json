", "4": "While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.\u201d ", "5": "When Anani\u2032as heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it.

Hark, the feet of those that have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.\u201d ", "10": "Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

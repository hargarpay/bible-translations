And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! ", "8": "Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?", "9": "\u201cI myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth. ", "10": "And I did so in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.

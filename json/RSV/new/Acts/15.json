", "3": "So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoeni\u2032cia and Samar\u2032ia, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren. ", "4": "When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.

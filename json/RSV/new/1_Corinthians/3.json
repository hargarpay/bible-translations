{"1": "But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ. ", "2": "I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready, ", "3": "for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary men? ", "4": "For when one says, \u201cI belong to Paul,\u201d and another, \u201cI belong to Apol\u2032los,\u201d are you not merely men?", "5": "What then is Apol\u2032los? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. ", "6": "I planted, Apol\u2032los watered, but God gave the growth. ", "7": "So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. ", "8": "He who plants and he who waters are equal, and each shall receive his wages according to his labor. ", "9": "For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.", "10": "According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it. ", "11": "For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. ", "12": "Now if any one builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw\u2014 ", "13": "each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. ", "14": "If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. ", "15": "If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.", "16": "Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? ", "17": "If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and that temple you are.", "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. ", "19": "For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, \u201cHe catches the wise in their craftiness,\u201d ", "20": "and again, \u201cThe Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.\u201d ", "21": "So let no one boast of men. For all things are yours, ", "22": "whether Paul or Apol\u2032los or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future, all are yours; ", "23": "and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's."}

{"1": "Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, ", "2": "with instruction[a] about ablutions, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. ", "3": "And this we will do if God permits.[b] ", "4": "For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, ", "5": "and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, ", "6": "if they then commit apostasy, since they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt. ", "7": "For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. ", "8": "But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.", "9": "Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation. ", "10": "For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do. ", "11": "And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end, ", "12": "so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.", "13": "For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, ", "14": "saying, \u201cSurely I will bless you and multiply you.\u201d ", "15": "And thus Abraham,[c] having patiently endured, obtained the promise. ", "16": "Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. ", "17": "So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath, ", "18": "so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God should prove false, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us. ", "19": "We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain, ", "20": "where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchiz\u2032edek."}

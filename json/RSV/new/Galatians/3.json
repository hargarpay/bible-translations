{"1": "O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? ", "2": "Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? ", "3": "Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh? ", "4": "Did you experience so many things in vain?\u2014if it really is in vain. ", "5": "Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?", "6": "Thus Abraham \u201cbelieved God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\u201d ", "7": "So you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham. ", "8": "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, \u201cIn you shall all the nations be blessed.\u201d ", "9": "So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.", "10": "For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, \u201cCursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them.\u201d ", "11": "Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for \u201cHe who through faith is righteous shall live\u201d;[a] ", "12": "but the law does not rest on faith, for \u201cHe who does them shall live by them.\u201d ", "13": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us\u2014for it is written, \u201cCursed be every one who hangs on a tree\u201d\u2014 ", "14": "that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.", "15": "To give a human example, brethren: no one annuls even a man's will,[b] or adds to it, once it has been ratified. ", "16": "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, \u201cAnd to offsprings,\u201d referring to many; but, referring to one, \u201cAnd to your offspring,\u201d which is Christ. ", "17": "This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. ", "18": "For if the inheritance is by the law, it is no longer by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.", "19": "Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained by angels through an intermediary. ", "20": "Now an intermediary implies more than one; but God is one.", "21": "Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not; for if a law had been given which could make alive, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. ", "22": "But the scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.", "23": "Now before faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. ", "24": "So that the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. ", "25": "But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian; ", "26": "for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. ", "27": "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. ", "28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. ", "29": "And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise."}

{"1": "Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Look to yourself, lest you too be tempted. ", "2": "Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. ", "3": "For if any one thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. ", "4": "But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. ", "5": "For each man will have to bear his own load.", "6": "Let him who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches.", "7": "Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. ", "8": "For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. ", "9": "And let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not lose heart. ", "10": "So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.", "11": "See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. ", "12": "It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that would compel you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. ", "13": "For even those who receive circumcision do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh. ", "14": "But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which[a] the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. ", "15": "For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. ", "16": "Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God.", "17": "Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.", "18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen."}

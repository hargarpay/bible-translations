", "2": "Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. ", "3": "For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, ", "4": "for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is the servant of God to execute his wrath on the wrongdoer.

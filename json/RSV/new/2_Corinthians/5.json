{"1": "For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. ", "2": "Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling, ", "3": "so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. ", "4": "For while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety; not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. ", "5": "He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.", "6": "So we are always of good courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, ", "7": "for we walk by faith, not by sight. ", "8": "We are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. ", "9": "So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. ", "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body.", "11": "Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. ", "12": "We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to be proud of us, so that you may be able to answer those who pride themselves on a man's position and not on his heart. ", "13": "For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. ", "14": "For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. ", "15": "And he died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.", "16": "From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no longer. ", "17": "Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation;[a] the old has passed away, behold, the new has come. ", "18": "All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; ", "19": "that is, in Christ God was reconciling[b] the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. ", "20": "So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. ", "21": "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."}

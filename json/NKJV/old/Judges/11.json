", "5": "And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. ", "6": "Then they said to Jephthah, \u201cCome and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.\u201d", "7": "So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, \u201cDid you not hate me, and expel me from my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in [a]distress?\u201d", "8": "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cThat is why we have turned[b] again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\u201d", "9": "So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, \u201cIf you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the Lord delivers them to me, shall I be your head?\u201d", "10": "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cThe Lord will be a witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.\u201d ", "11": "Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.", "12": "Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, \u201cWhat do you have against me, that you have come to fight against me in my land?\u201d", "13": "And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, \u201cBecause Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those lands peaceably.\u201d", "14": "So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, ", "15": "and said to him, \u201cThus says Jephthah: 'Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon; ", "16": "for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.

", "33": "And he [e]defeated them from Aroer as far as Minnith\u2014twenty cities\u2014and to [f]Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter.

Besides her he had neither son nor daughter. ", "35": "And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, \u201cAlas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have [g]given my word to the Lord, and I cannot [h]go back on it.\u201d", "36": "So she said to him, \u201cMy father, if you have given your word to the Lord, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon.\u201d ", "37": "Then she said to her father, \u201cLet this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and [i]bewail my virginity, my [j]friends and I.\u201d", "38": "So he said, \u201cGo.\u201d And he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.

And he said, \u201cLet me go in to my wife, into her room.\u201d But her father would not permit him to go in.", "2": "Her father said, \u201cI really thought that you thoroughly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.\u201d", "3": "And Samson said to them, \u201cThis time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!\u201d ", "4": "Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails. ", "5": "When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.", "6": "Then the Philistines said, \u201cWho has done this?\u201d And they answered, \u201cSamson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.\u201d So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.", "7": "Samson said to them, \u201cSince you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.\u201d ", "8": "So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.", "9": "Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves against Lehi. ", "10": "And the men of Judah said, \u201cWhy have you come up against us?\u201d So they answered, \u201cWe have come up to [a]arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.\u201d", "11": "Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, \u201cDo you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us?\u201d And he said to them, \u201cAs they did to me, so I have done to them.\u201d", "12": "But they said to him, \u201cWe have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.\u201d Then Samson said to them, \u201cSwear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.\u201d", "13": "So they spoke to him, saying, \u201cNo, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.\u201d And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.", "14": "When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him.

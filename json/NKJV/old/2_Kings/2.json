{"1": "And it came to pass, when the Lord was about to take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. ", "2": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!\u201d So they went down to Bethel.", "3": "Now the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord will take away your master [a]from over you today?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, I know; keep silent!\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to him, \u201cElisha, stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho.\u201d But he said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!\u201d So they came to Jericho.", "5": "Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?\u201d So he answered, \u201cYes, I know; keep silent!\u201d", "6": "Then Elijah said to him, \u201cStay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to the Jordan.\u201d But he said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!\u201d So the two of them went on. ", "7": "And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan. ", "8": "Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.", "9": "And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cAsk! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cPlease let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.\u201d", "10": "So he said, \u201cYou have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.\u201d ", "11": "Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.", "12": "And Elisha saw it, and he cried out, \u201cMy father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!\u201d So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. ", "13": "He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. ", "14": "Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, \u201cWhere is the Lord God of Elijah?\u201d And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.", "15": "Now when the sons of the prophets who were from[b] Jericho saw him, they said, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.\u201d And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him. ", "16": "Then they said to him, \u201cLook now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou shall not send anyone.\u201d", "17": "But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, \u201cSend them!\u201d Therefore they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him. ", "18": "And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, \u201cDid I not say to you, 'Do not go'?\u201d", "19": "Then the men of the city said to Elisha, \u201cPlease notice, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.\u201d", "20": "And he said, \u201cBring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.\u201d So they brought it to him. ", "21": "Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, \u201cThus says the Lord: 'I have [c]healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.' \u201d ", "22": "So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.", "23": "Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, \u201cGo up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!\u201d", "24": "So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.", "25": "Then he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."}

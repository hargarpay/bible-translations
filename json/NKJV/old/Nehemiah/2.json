This is nothing but sorrow of heart.\u201d So I became [b]dreadfully afraid, ", "3": "and said to the king, \u201cMay the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire?\u201d", "4": "Then the king said to me, \u201cWhat do you request?\u201d So I prayed to the God of heaven.

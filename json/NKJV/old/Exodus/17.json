Why do you tempt the Lord?\u201d", "3": "And the people thirsted there for water, and the people complained against Moses, and said, \u201cWhy is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?\u201d", "4": "So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, \u201cWhat shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone[a] me!\u201d", "5": "And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel.

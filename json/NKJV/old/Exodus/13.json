No leavened bread shall be eaten. ", "4": "On this day you are going out, in the month Abib. ", "5": "And it shall be, when the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.

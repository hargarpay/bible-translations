{"1": "Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, \u201cLet those who have charge over the city draw near, each with a [a]deadly weapon in his hand.\u201d ", "2": "And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his [b]battle-ax in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writer's inkhorn [c]at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.", "3": "Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the [d]temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer's inkhorn at his side; ", "4": "and the Lord said to him, \u201cGo through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.\u201d", "5": "To the others He said in my [e]hearing, \u201cGo after him through the city and kill;[f] do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity. ", "6": "Utterly[g] slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.\u201d So they began with the elders who were before the [h]temple. ", "7": "Then He said to them, \u201cDefile the [i]temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!\u201d And they went out and killed in the city.", "8": "So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, \u201cAh, Lord God! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?\u201d", "9": "Then He said to me, \u201cThe iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for they say, 'The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see!' ", "10": "And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but I will recompense their deeds on their own head.\u201d", "11": "Just then, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, \u201cI have done as You commanded me.\u201d"}

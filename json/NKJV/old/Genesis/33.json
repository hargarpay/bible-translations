", "3": "Then he crossed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.", "4": "But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. ", "5": "And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, \u201cWho are these with you?\u201d So he said, \u201cThe children whom God has graciously given your servant.\u201d ", "6": "Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down.

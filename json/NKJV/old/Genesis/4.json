Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. ", "3": "And [c]in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. ", "4": "Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering, ", "5": "but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.", "6": "So the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? ", "7": "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is [d]for you, but you should rule over it.\u201d", "8": "Now Cain [e]talked with Abel his [f]brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.", "9": "Then the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhere is Abel your brother?\u201d He said, \u201cI do not know.

{"1": "It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah. ", "2": "And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her and went in to her. ", "3": "So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. ", "4": "She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. ", "5": "And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.", "6": "Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. ", "7": "But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord killed him. ", "8": "And Judah said to Onan, \u201cGo in to your brother's wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.\u201d ", "9": "But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should give an heir to his brother. ", "10": "And the thing which he did [a]displeased the Lord; therefore He killed him also.", "11": "Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, \u201cRemain a widow in your father's house till my son Shelah is grown.\u201d For he said, \u201cLest he also die like his brothers.\u201d And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.", "12": "Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. ", "13": "And it was told Tamar, saying, \u201cLook, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.\u201d ", "14": "So she took off her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife. ", "15": "When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had covered her face. ", "16": "Then he turned to her by the way, and said, \u201cPlease let me come in to you\u201d; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, \u201cWhat will you give me, that you may come in to me?\u201d", "17": "And he said, \u201cI will send a young goat from the flock.\u201d So she said, \u201cWill you give me a pledge till you send it?\u201d", "18": "Then he said, \u201cWhat pledge shall I give you?\u201d So she said, \u201cYour signet and cord, and your staff that is in your hand.\u201d Then he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him. ", "19": "So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.", "20": "And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her. ", "21": "Then he asked the men of that place, saying, \u201cWhere is the harlot who was [b]openly by the roadside?\u201d And they said, \u201cThere was no harlot in this place.\u201d", "22": "So he returned to Judah and said, \u201cI cannot find her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot in this place.\u201d", "23": "Then Judah said, \u201cLet her take them for herself, lest we be shamed; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.\u201d", "24": "And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying, \u201cTamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is [c]with child by harlotry.\u201d So Judah said, \u201cBring her out and let her be burned!\u201d", "25": "When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, \u201cBy the man to whom these belong, I am with child.\u201d And she said, \u201cPlease determine whose these are\u2014the signet and cord, and staff.\u201d", "26": "So Judah acknowledged them and said, \u201cShe has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.\u201d And he never knew her again.", "27": "Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins were in her womb. ", "28": "And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and bound it on his hand, saying, \u201cThis one came out first.\u201d ", "29": "Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out unexpectedly; and she said, \u201cHow did you break through? This breach be upon you!\u201d Therefore his name was called Perez.[d] ", "30": "Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand. And his name was called Zerah."}

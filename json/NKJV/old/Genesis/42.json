", "4": "But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, \u201cLest some calamity befall him.\u201d ", "5": "And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.", "6": "Now Joseph was governor over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the earth. ", "7": "Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke [a]roughly to them. Then he said to them, \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d And they said, \u201cFrom the land of Canaan to buy food.\u201d", "8": "So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. ", "9": "Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, \u201cYou are spies! You have come to see the [b]nakedness of the land!\u201d", "10": "And they said to him, \u201cNo, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. ", "11": "We are all one man's sons; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.\u201d", "12": "But he said to them, \u201cNo, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.\u201d", "13": "And they said, \u201cYour servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.\u201d", "14": "But Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is as I spoke to you, saying, 'You are spies!' ", "15": "In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. ", "16": "Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be [c]kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!\u201d ", "17": "So he [d]put them all together in prison three days.", "18": "Then Joseph said to them the third day, \u201cDo this and live, for I fear God: ", "19": "If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses.

{"1": "Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, \u201cIndeed your father is sick\u201d; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. ", "2": "And Jacob was told, \u201cLook, your son Joseph is coming to you\u201d; and Israel [a]strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. ", "3": "Then Jacob said to Joseph: \u201cGod Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, ", "4": "and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.' ", "5": "And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. ", "6": "Your [b]offspring [c]whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. ", "7": "But as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).\u201d", "8": "Then Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, \u201cWho are these?\u201d", "9": "Joseph said to his father, \u201cThey are my sons, whom God has given me in this place.\u201d And he said, \u201cPlease bring them to me, and I will bless them.\u201d ", "10": "Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. Then Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. ", "11": "And Israel said to Joseph, \u201cI had not thought to see your face; but in fact, God has also shown me your offspring!\u201d", "12": "So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth. ", "13": "And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him. ", "14": "Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. ", "15": "And he blessed Joseph, and said: \u201cGod, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has fed me all my life long to this day,", "16": "The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; Let my name be named upon them, And the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\u201d", "17": "Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.

", "4": "And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; ", "5": "because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.\u201d", "6": "So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. ", "7": "And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, \u201cShe is my sister\u201d; for he was afraid to say, \u201cShe is my wife,\u201d because he thought, \u201clest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to behold.\u201d ", "8": "Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac, [a]showing endearment to Rebekah his wife.

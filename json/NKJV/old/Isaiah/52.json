{"1": "Awake, awake! Put on your strength, O Zion; Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city! For the uncircumcised and the unclean Shall no longer come to you.", "2": "Shake yourself from the dust, arise; Sit down, O Jerusalem! Loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion!", "3": "For thus says the Lord: \u201cYou have sold yourselves for nothing, And you shall be redeemed without money.\u201d", "4": "For thus says the Lord God: \u201cMy people went down at first Into Egypt to [a]dwell there; Then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.", "5": "Now therefore, what have I here,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cThat My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them [b]Make them wail,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cAnd My name is blasphemed continually every day.", "6": "Therefore My people shall know My name; Therefore they shall know in that day That I am He who speaks: 'Behold, it is I.' \u201d", "7": "How beautiful upon the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who proclaims peace, Who brings glad tidings of good things, Who proclaims salvation, Who says to Zion, \u201cYour God reigns!\u201d", "8": "Your watchmen shall lift up their voices, With their voices they shall sing together; For they shall see eye to eye When the Lord brings back Zion.", "9": "Break forth into joy, sing together, You waste places of Jerusalem! For the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem.", "10": "The Lord has [c]made bare His holy arm In the eyes of all the nations; And all the ends of the earth shall see The salvation of our God.", "11": "Depart! Depart! Go out from there, Touch no unclean thing; Go out from the midst of her, Be clean, You who bear the vessels of the Lord.", "12": "For you shall not go out with haste, Nor go by flight; For the Lord will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rear guard.", "13": "Behold, My Servant shall [d]deal prudently; He shall be exalted and [e]extolled and be very high.", "14": "Just as many were astonished at you, So His visage[f] was marred more than any man, And His form more than the sons of men;", "15": "So shall He [g]sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at Him; For what had not been told them they shall see, And what they had not heard they shall consider."}

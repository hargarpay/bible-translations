{"1": "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.", "2": "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the Lord has spoken: \u201cI have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against Me;", "3": "The ox knows its owner And the donkey its master's [a]crib; But Israel does not know, My people do not [b]consider.\u201d", "4": "Alas, sinful nation, A people [c]laden with iniquity, A [d]brood of evildoers, Children who are corrupters! They have forsaken the Lord, They have provoked to anger The Holy One of Israel, They have turned away backward.", "5": "Why should you be stricken again? You will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faints.", "6": "From the sole of the foot even to the head, There is no soundness in it, But wounds and bruises and putrefying sores; They have not been closed or bound up, Or soothed with ointment.", "7": "Your country is desolate, Your cities are burned with fire; Strangers devour your land in your presence; And it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.", "8": "So the daughter of Zion is left as a [e]booth in a vineyard, As a hut in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city.", "9": "Unless the Lord of hosts Had left to us a very small remnant, We would have become like Sodom, We would have been made like Gomorrah.", "10": "Hear the word of the Lord, You rulers of Sodom; Give ear to the law of our God, You people of Gomorrah:", "11": "\u201cTo what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?\u201d Says the Lord. \u201cI have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle.

The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies\u2014 I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting.", "14": "Your New Moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; They are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them.", "15": "When you [g]spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; Even though you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of [h]blood.", "16": "\u201cWash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes.

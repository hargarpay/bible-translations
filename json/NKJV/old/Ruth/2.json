{"1": "There was a relative of Naomi's husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz. ", "2": "So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, \u201cPlease let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor.\u201d And she said to her, \u201cGo, my daughter.\u201d", "3": "Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.", "4": "Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, \u201cThe Lord be with you!\u201d And they answered him, \u201cThe Lord bless you!\u201d", "5": "Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, \u201cWhose young woman is this?\u201d", "6": "So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, \u201cIt is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. ", "7": "And she said, 'Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.\u201d", "8": "Then Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cYou will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women. ", "9": "Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.\u201d", "10": "So she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, \u201cWhy have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?\u201d", "11": "And Boaz answered and said to her, \u201cIt has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before.

", "15": "And when she rose up to [b]glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, \u201cLet her glean even among the sheaves, and do not [c]reproach her. ", "16": "Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.\u201d", "17": "So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. ", "18": "Then she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied.", "19": "And her mother-in-law said to her, \u201cWhere have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.\u201d So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, \u201cThe man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.\u201d", "20": "Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \u201cBlessed be he of the Lord, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!\u201d And Naomi said to her, \u201cThis man is a relation of ours, one of [d]our close relatives.\u201d", "21": "Ruth the Moabitess said, \u201cHe also said to me, 'You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.' \u201d", "22": "And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, \u201cIt is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not [e]meet you in any other field.\u201d ", "23": "So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law."}

{"1": "And it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, \u201cGo, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the earth.\u201d", "2": "So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and there was a severe famine in Samaria. ", "3": "And Ahab had called Obadiah, who was [a]in charge of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly. ", "4": "For so it was, while Jezebel [b]massacred the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.) ", "5": "And Ahab had said to Obadiah, \u201cGo into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.\u201d ", "6": "So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.", "7": "Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, \u201cIs that you, my lord Elijah?\u201d", "8": "And he answered him, \u201cIt is I. Go, tell your master, 'Elijah is here.' \u201d", "9": "So he said, \u201cHow have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? ", "10": "As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, 'He is not here,' he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you. ", "11": "And now you say, 'Go, tell your master, \u201cElijah is here\u201d '! ", "12": "And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the Lord will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth. ", "13": "Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hid one hundred men of the Lord's prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? ", "14": "And now you say, 'Go, tell your master, \u201cElijah is here.\u201d ' He will kill me!\u201d", "15": "Then Elijah said, \u201cAs the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.\u201d", "16": "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.", "17": "Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, \u201cIs that you, O troubler of Israel?\u201d", "18": "And he answered, \u201cI have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals. ", "19": "Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of [c]Asherah, who [d]eat at Jezebel's table.\u201d", "20": "So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel. ", "21": "And Elijah came to all the people, and said, \u201cHow long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.\u201d But the people answered him not a word. ", "22": "Then Elijah said to the people, \u201cI alone am left a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. ", "23": "Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it. ", "24": "Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.\u201d So all the people answered and said, [e]\u201cIt is well spoken.\u201d", "25": "Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \u201cChoose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.\u201d", "26": "So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, \u201cO Baal, [f]hear us!\u201d But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they [g]leaped about the altar which they had made.", "27": "And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, \u201cCry [h]aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.\u201d ", "28": "So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with [i]knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. ", "29": "And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.", "30": "Then Elijah said to all the people, \u201cCome near to me.\u201d So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. ", "31": "And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, \u201cIsrael shall be your name.\u201d ", "32": "Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. ", "33": "And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, \u201cFill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.\u201d ", "34": "Then he said, \u201cDo it a second time,\u201d and they did it a second time; and he said, \u201cDo it a third time,\u201d and they did it a third time. ", "35": "So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.", "36": "And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, \u201cLord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. ", "37": "Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You are the Lord God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.\u201d", "38": "Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench. ", "39": "Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, \u201cThe Lord, He is God! The Lord, He is God!\u201d", "40": "And Elijah said to them, \u201cSeize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!\u201d So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there.", "41": "Then Elijah said to Ahab, \u201cGo up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.\u201d ", "42": "So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, ", "43": "and said to his servant, \u201cGo up now, look toward the sea.\u201d So he went up and looked, and said, \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d And seven times he said, \u201cGo again.\u201d", "44": "Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, \u201cThere is a cloud, as small as a man's hand, rising out of the sea!\u201d So he said, \u201cGo up, say to Ahab, [j]'Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.' \u201d", "45": "Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. ", "46": "Then the hand of the Lord came upon Elijah; and he girded[k] up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."}

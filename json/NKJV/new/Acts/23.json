", "3": "Then Paul said to him, \u201cGod will strike you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit to judge me according to the law, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the law?\u201d", "4": "And those who stood by said, \u201cDo you revile God's high priest?\u201d", "5": "Then Paul said, \u201cI did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.' \u201d", "6": "But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, \u201cMen and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!\u201d", "7": "And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.

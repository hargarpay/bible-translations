{"1": "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for [a]Israel is that they may be saved. ", "2": "For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. ", "3": "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God. ", "4": "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.", "5": "For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, \u201cThe man who does those things shall live by them.\u201d ", "6": "But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, \u201cDo not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' \u201d (that is, to bring Christ down from above) ", "7": "or, \u201c 'Who will descend into the abyss?' \u201d (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). ", "8": "But what does it say? \u201cThe word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\u201d (that is, the word of faith which we preach): ", "9": "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. ", "10": "For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

", "13": "For \u201cwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d", "14": "How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? ", "15": "And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: \u201cHow beautiful are the feet of those who [b]preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!\u201d", "16": "But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, \u201cLord, who has believed our report?\u201d ", "17": "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.", "18": "But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed: \u201cTheir sound has gone out to all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world.\u201d", "19": "But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: \u201cI will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, I will move you to anger by a foolish nation.\u201d", "20": "But Isaiah is very bold and says: \u201cI was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me.\u201d", "21": "But to Israel he says: \u201cAll day long I have stretched out My hands To a disobedient and contrary people.\u201d"}

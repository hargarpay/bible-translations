{"1": "Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, ", "2": "\u201cWhy do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.\u201d", "3": "He answered and said to them, \u201cWhy do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? ", "4": "For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' ", "5": "But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, \u201cWhatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God\u201d\u2014 ", "6": "then he need not honor his father [a]or mother.' Thus you have made the [b]commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. ", "7": "Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:", "8": "'These people [c]draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me.", "9": "And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' \u201d", "10": "When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, \u201cHear and understand: ", "11": "Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.\u201d", "12": "Then His disciples came and said to Him, \u201cDo You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?\u201d", "13": "But He answered and said, \u201cEvery plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.

And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.\u201d", "15": "Then Peter answered and said to Him, \u201cExplain this parable to us.\u201d", "16": "So Jesus said, \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ", "17": "Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? ", "18": "But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. ", "19": "For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.

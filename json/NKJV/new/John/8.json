{"1": "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.", "2": "Now [a]early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. ", "3": "Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, ", "4": "they said to Him, \u201cTeacher, [b]this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. ", "5": "Now [c]Moses, in the law, commanded us [d]that such should be stoned. But what do You [e]say?\u201d ", "6": "This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, [f]as though He did not hear.", "7": "So when they continued asking Him, He [g]raised Himself up and said to them, \u201cHe who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.\u201d ", "8": "And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. ", "9": "Then those who heard it, being[h] convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. ", "10": "When Jesus had raised Himself up [i]and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, \u201cWoman, where are those accusers [j]of yours? Has no one condemned you?\u201d", "11": "She said, \u201cNo one, Lord.\u201d And Jesus said to her, \u201cNeither do I condemn you; go [k]and sin no more.\u201d", "12": "Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, \u201cI am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.\u201d", "13": "The Pharisees therefore said to Him, \u201cYou bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not [l]true.\u201d", "14": "Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cEven if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going. ", "15": "You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. ", "16": "And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent Me. ", "17": "It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true. ", "18": "I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.\u201d", "19": "Then they said to Him, \u201cWhere is Your Father?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.\u201d", "20": "These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.", "21": "Then Jesus said to them again, \u201cI am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.\u201d", "22": "So the Jews said, \u201cWill He kill Himself, because He says, 'Where I go you cannot come'?\u201d", "23": "And He said to them, \u201cYou are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.

", "26": "I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.\u201d", "27": "They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.", "28": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cWhen you lift[m] up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things. ", "29": "And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.\u201d ", "30": "As He spoke these words, many believed in Him.", "31": "Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, \u201cIf you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. ", "32": "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d", "33": "They answered Him, \u201cWe are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say, 'You will be made free'?\u201d", "34": "Jesus answered them, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.

", "41": "You do the deeds of your father.\u201d Then they said to Him, \u201cWe were not born of fornication; we have one Father\u2014God.\u201d", "42": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me.

He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.

", "47": "He who is of God hears God's words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.\u201d", "48": "Then the Jews answered and said to Him, \u201cDo we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?\u201d", "49": "Jesus answered, \u201cI do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. ", "50": "And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.

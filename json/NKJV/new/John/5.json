{"1": "After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ", "2": "Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, [a]Bethesda, having five porches. ", "3": "In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, [b]paralyzed, [c]waiting for the moving of the water. ", "4": "For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. ", "5": "Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. ", "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, \u201cDo you want to be made well?\u201d", "7": "The sick man answered Him, \u201cSir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.\u201d", "8": "Jesus said to him, \u201cRise, take up your bed and walk.\u201d ", "9": "And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the Sabbath. ", "10": "The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, \u201cIt is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.\u201d", "11": "He answered them, \u201cHe who made me well said to me, 'Take up your bed and walk.' \u201d", "12": "Then they asked him, \u201cWho is the Man who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?\u201d ", "13": "But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place. ", "14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, \u201cSee, you have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.\u201d", "15": "The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.", "16": "For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, [d]and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath. ", "17": "But Jesus answered them, \u201cMy Father has been working until now, and I have been working.\u201d", "18": "Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God. ", "19": "Then Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner. ", "20": "For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel. ", "21": "For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will. ", "22": "For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son, ", "23": "that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.", "24": "\u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. ", "25": "Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. ", "26": "For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself, ", "27": "and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man. ", "28": "Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice ", "29": "and come forth\u2014those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation. ", "30": "I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.", "31": "\u201cIf I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not [e]true. ", "32": "There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true. ", "33": "You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. ", "34": "Yet I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved. ", "35": "He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light. ", "36": "But I have a greater witness than John's; for the works which the Father has given Me to finish\u2014the very works that I do\u2014bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me. ", "37": "And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form. ", "38": "But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe. ", "39": "You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me. ", "40": "But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.", "41": "\u201cI do not receive honor from men. ", "42": "But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you. ", "43": "I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. ", "44": "How can you believe, who receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God? ", "45": "Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you\u2014Moses, in whom you trust. ", "46": "For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me. ", "47": "But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?\u201d"}

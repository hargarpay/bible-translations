{"1": "Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. ", "2": "He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

", "5": "And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d", "6": "So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.", "7": "Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, ", "8": "and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. ", "9": "Herod said, \u201cJohn I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?\u201d So he sought to see Him.", "10": "And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. ", "11": "But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing. ", "12": "When the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, \u201cSend the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.\u201d", "13": "But He said to them, \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ", "14": "For there were about five thousand men.

", "29": "As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening. ", "30": "And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah, ", "31": "who appeared in glory and spoke of His [c]decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. ", "32": "But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him. ", "33": "Then it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, \u201cMaster, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three [d]tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014not knowing what he said.", "34": "While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the cloud.

Bring your son here.\u201d ", "42": "And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.", "43": "And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples, ", "44": "\u201cLet these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.\u201d ", "45": "But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.", "46": "Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest.

For he who is least among you all will be great.\u201d", "49": "Now John answered and said, \u201cMaster, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.\u201d", "50": "But Jesus said to him, \u201cDo not forbid him, for he who is not against [h]us is on [i]our side.\u201d", "51": "Now it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be received up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem, ", "52": "and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him. ", "53": "But they did not receive Him, because His face was set for the journey to Jerusalem.

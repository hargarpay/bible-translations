{"1": "My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality. ", "2": "For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in [a]fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in [b]filthy clothes, ", "3": "and you [c]pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, \u201cYou sit here in a good place,\u201d and say to the poor man, \u201cYou stand there,\u201d or, \u201cSit here at my footstool,\u201d ", "4": "have you not [d]shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?", "5": "Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? ", "6": "But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? ", "7": "Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?", "8": "If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself,\u201d you do well; ", "9": "but if you [e]show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. ", "10": "For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. ", "11": "For He who said, \u201cDo not commit adultery,\u201d also said, \u201cDo not murder.\u201d Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. ", "12": "So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty. ", "13": "For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.", "14": "What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? ", "15": "If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, ", "16": "and one of you says to them, \u201cDepart in peace, be warmed and filled,\u201d but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?

", "22": "Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made [i]perfect? ", "23": "And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was [j]accounted to him for righteousness.\u201d And he was called the friend of God.

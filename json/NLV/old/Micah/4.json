", "2": "Many nations will come and say, \u201cCome, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about His ways, so that we may walk in His paths.\u201d For the Law will go out from Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. ", "3": "He will judge between many people. He will decide for strong nations that are far away. Then they will beat their swords into plows, and their spears into cutting hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, and they will never learn war any more. ", "4": "Every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree, with no one to make him afraid. For the mouth of the Lord of All has spoken. ", "5": "All the nations may walk in the name of their god. But we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.", "6": "\u201cIn that day,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cI will gather together those who cannot walk and those who have been driven away, even those whom I have made to suffer.

There you will be saved and He will make you free from the power of those who hate you.", "11": "\u201cNow many nations are gathered against you. They say, 'Let her be unclean. Let our eyes look on Zion.' ", "12": "But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord. They do not understand His plan. For He has gathered them like grain to the crushing-floor. ", "13": "Get up and crush the grain, O people of Zion. For I will give you horns of iron and feet of brass, and you will break many nations to pieces. You will give to the Lord what they received by hurting others. You will give their riches to the Lord of all the earth."}

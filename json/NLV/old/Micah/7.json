{"1": "It is bad for me! For I am like those who pick fruit and gather grapes. There are no grapes to eat, or any of the early figs that I want so much. ", "2": "There is not a God-like person left in the land. There is no good person among men. All of them lie in wait to kill. Each one hunts the other with a net. ", "3": "Both hands are very able in doing sinful things. The ruler and the judge ask for pay in secret to do what is wrong. The powerful man tells what he wants, and they all make plans together. ", "4": "The best of them is like a thistle. The most honest of them is like a thorn bush. The day you have a watchman, you will be punished. Then their trouble will come. ", "5": "Do not trust a neighbor. Do not put trust in a friend. Be careful what you say even with her who lies in your arms. ", "6": "For a son does not honor his father. A daughter rises up against her mother. And a daughter-in-law turns against her mother-in-law. Those of a man's own house hate him.", "7": "But as for me, I will watch for the Lord. I will wait for the God Who saves me. My God will hear me.", "8": "Do not have joy over me, you who hate me. When I fall, I will rise. Even though I am in darkness, the Lord will be my light. ", "9": "I will suffer under the Lord's anger, because I have sinned against Him, until He speaks for me and does what is fair for me. He will bring me out to the light, and I will see His saving power. ", "10": "Then the one who hated me will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, \u201cWhere is the Lord your God?\u201d My eyes will look on her, and she will be crushed under foot like mud in the streets. ", "11": "It will be a day for building your walls. At that time your land will be made larger. ", "12": "In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, from Egypt to the Euphrates River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. ", "13": "The earth will be laid waste because of its people and the things they have done.", "14": "Shepherd Your people with Your power. Take care of Your chosen flock which lives by itself in the woods, in a field of much fruit. Let them eat in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. ", "15": "\u201cAs in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show you powerful works.\u201d ", "16": "Nations will see and be ashamed of all their power. They will put their hands on their mouths, and will not be able to hear with their ears. ", "17": "They will eat the dust like a snake, like animals that move along the ground. They will come out of their strong-places shaking with fear. They will come in much fear to the Lord our God, and they will be afraid of You. ", "18": "Who is a God like You, Who forgives sin and the wrong-doing of Your chosen people who are left? He does not stay angry forever because He is happy to show loving-kindness. ", "19": "He will again have loving-pity on us. He will crush our sins under foot. Yes, You will throw all our sins into the deep sea. ", "20": "You will be true to Jacob and show loving-kindness to Abraham, as You promised our fathers in days long ago."}

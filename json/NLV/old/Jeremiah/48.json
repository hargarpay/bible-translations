{"1": "About Moab, the Lord of All, the God of Israel, says, \u201cIt is bad for Nebo, for it has been destroyed. Kiriathaim has been put to shame and taken. The high, strong-place has been put to shame and crushed. ", "2": "The praise for Moab has come to an end. In Heshbon they have planned trouble against her, saying, 'Come, let us destroy her from being a nation!' You, O Madmen, will be made quiet also. The sword will follow you. ", "3": "Listen, the sound of a cry from Horonaim, saying, 'Laid waste and all destroyed!' ", "4": "Moab is destroyed. The cry of her little ones is heard. ", "5": "They go up the hill of Luhith crying all the time. For at the hill of Horonaim they have heard the troubled cry of those who are being destroyed. ", "6": "Run fast! Run for your lives! You will be like a bush in the desert. ", "7": "Because you have trusted in your own works and riches, you also will be taken. And Chemosh will go away to a strange land together with his religious leaders and important men. ", "8": "The destroyer will come to every city. No city will be free from him. The valley and the plain will be destroyed also, as the Lord has said. ", "9": "Give wings to Moab, for she will fly away. Her cities will become a waste, with no people living in them. ", "10": "The one who does the Lord's work without care is cursed. Cursed is the one who keeps his sword from blood.", "11": "\u201cMoab has been at rest since he was young. He has been like wine which sits a long time, not being poured from jar to jar. He has not gone away to a strange land. So he keeps his taste, and his smell is not changed. ", "12": "The days are coming,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cwhen I will send to him those who turn over jars, and they will turn him over. They will empty his jars and break them in pieces. ", "13": "Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel that they trusted. ", "14": "How can you say, 'We are strong soldiers and powerful men of war'? ", "15": "Moab has been destroyed, and men have gone up to his cities. His best young men have gone down to be killed,\u201d says the King, Whose name is the Lord of All. ", "16": "The trouble of Moab will soon come. His suffering comes in a hurry. ", "17": "Have sorrow for him, all you who live around him, and all who know his name. Say, 'How his power has been broken, the greatness of his power!' ", "18": "Come down from your greatness and sit on the hot ground, O you who live in Dibon. For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you. He has destroyed your strong-places built for battle. ", "19": "Stand by the road and keep watch, O you who live in Aroer. Ask the man or woman who runs away, 'What has happened?' ", "20": "Moab has been put to shame, for it is broken down. Cry out. Let it be known by the Arnon that Moab has been destroyed.

I will have sorrow for the men of Kir-heres. ", "32": "I will cry for you more than for Jazer, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches have gone over the sea, even to the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen upon your summer fruits and your grapes. ", "33": "Happiness and joy have been taken away from the land of Moab with all its fruit. I have stopped the crushing of the grapes to make wine. No one crushes them under foot. The noise they make is not the sound of joy. ", "34": "They cry out from Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz, and from Zoar even to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah. Even the waters of Nimrim have become a waste. ", "35": "And I will make an end of Moab,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cI will destroy the one who gives gifts of worship on the high place and burns special perfume to his gods.", "36": "\u201cSo My heart cries out for Moab like a horn. My heart cries like a horn also for the men of Kir-heres. The riches they had for themselves have been lost.

For a fire has gone out from Heshbon and from Sihon. It has destroyed the forehead of Moab and the top of the heads of the trouble-makers. ", "46": "It is bad for you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have been destroyed. Your sons and daughters have been taken away in chains. ", "47": "Yet I will return the people of Moab to their land in the last days,\u201d says the Lord. This is the punishment of Moab."}

{"1": "The Word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah when there was no water: ", "2": "\u201cJudah is full of sorrow and her gates are weak. Her people sit on the ground in sorrow, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem. ", "3": "Their men of honor have sent their servants for water. They have come to the wells and found no water, and returned with their jars empty. They have been put to shame and troubled, and covered their heads. ", "4": "The ground is dried up because there has been no rain on the land. The farmers have been put to shame and have covered their heads. ", "5": "Even the deer in the field leaves her young one which has just been born, because there is no grass. ", "6": "The wild donkeys stand on the open hill-tops. They breathe hard for air like wild dogs. Their eyes become weak because there is nothing to eat.", "7": "\u201cEven when our sins speak against us, O Lord, do something for the good of Your name. For we have fallen away from You many times. We have sinned against You. ", "8": "You are the Hope of Israel, the One Who saves it in time of trouble. Why are You like a stranger in the land? Why are You like a traveler who has set up his tent for the night? ", "9": "Why are You like a man surprised, like a strong man who cannot save? Yet You are among us, O Lord, and we are called by Your name. Do not leave us!\u201d", "10": "The Lord says this about these people, \u201cThey have loved to go their own way.

But I will destroy them by the sword, hunger and disease.\u201d", "13": "Then I said, \u201cO Lord God, the ones who speak in Your name are telling them, 'You will not see the sword and you will not go hungry. But I will give you lasting peace in this place.'\u201d ", "14": "Then the Lord said to me, \u201cThose men are speaking lies in My name. I have not sent them, or told them, or spoken to them. They are telling you a false dream of a false future that means nothing. They are speaking the lies of their own hearts. ", "15": "So this is what the Lord says about those men who tell what is going to happen in the future using My name. I did not send them, yet they keep saying, 'There will be no sword or hunger in this land.' So by the sword and by hunger those false teachers will be destroyed!

{"1": "This word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, ", "2": "\u201cStand in the gate of the Lord's house and make this word known: 'Hear the Word of the Lord, all you men of Judah who go through these gates to worship the Lord!'\u201d ", "3": "The Lord of All, the God of Israel, says, \u201cChange your ways and your works for the better, and I will let you live in this place. ", "4": "Do not trust the lies that say, 'This is the house of the Lord, the house of the Lord, the house of the Lord.' ", "5": "For if you for sure change your ways and what you do for the better, if you are fair as you judge between a man and his neighbor, ", "6": "if you do not make it hard for the stranger from another land, or the child whose parents have died, or the woman whose husband has died, and do not kill those who are not guilty in this place, and stop going after other gods, for that will destroy you, ", "7": "then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.", "8": "\u201cSee, you are trusting in lies which cannot help you. ", "9": "Will you steal, kill, do sex sins, make false promises, give gifts to the false god Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, ", "10": "and then come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, 'We are safe and free!' and still do all these hated sins? ", "11": "Has this house which is called by My name become a place of robbers in your eyes? See, I Myself have seen it,\u201d says the Lord.", "12": "\u201cBut go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a place for My name. And see what I did to it because of the sin of My people Israel. ", "13": "Now you have done all these things,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cI spoke to you again and again, but you did not hear. I called you but you did not answer. ", "14": "So as I did to Shiloh, I will do to the house that is called by My name and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave you and your fathers. ", "15": "I will send you away from My eyes, as I have sent away all your brothers, all the children of Ephraim.", "16": "\u201cAs for you, do not pray for these people. Do not lift up a cry or prayer for them. Do not speak with Me about them, for I do not hear you. ", "17": "Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? ", "18": "The children gather wood. The fathers make the fire. And the women make bread and cakes for the queen of heaven. They pour out drink gifts to other gods to make Me angry. ", "19": "Do they make Me angry?\u201d says the Lord. \u201cIs it not themselves they hurt, to their own shame?\u201d ", "20": "So the Lord God says, \u201cSee, My anger will be poured out on this place, on man and animal, on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground. It will burn and not be stopped.\u201d", "21": "The Lord of All, the God of Israel, says, \u201cAdd your burnt gifts to the animals you kill on the altar, and eat the flesh.

", "25": "Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants who speak for Me. I have risen up early and sent them day after day. ", "26": "Yet they did not listen to Me or turn their ear to Me, but made their neck hard. They sinned more than their fathers.", "27": "\u201cYou will speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You will call to them, but they will not answer you.

It has been cut off from their mouth. ", "29": "Cut off your hair and throw it away. And cry in sorrow on the open hill-tops. For the Lord has turned away and left the people who made Him angry.'

", "31": "And they have built the high places of Topheth, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters in the fire. I did not tell them to do this. It did not come into My mind. ", "32": "So the days are coming,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cwhen it will not be called Topheth any more, or the valley of the son of Hinnom. But it will be called the valley of Killing. For they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place. ", "33": "The dead bodies of these people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the earth. And no one will send them away in fear. ", "34": "Then in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, I will put an end to the voice of joy and the voice of happiness, the voice of the man to be married and the voice of the bride. For the land will become a waste."}

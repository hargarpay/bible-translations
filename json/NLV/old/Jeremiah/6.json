For a sinful power is coming down from the north, that will destroy much. ", "2": "I will cut off the beautiful and fine ones, the people of Zion. ", "3": "Shepherds and their flocks will come to her. They will set up their tents around her and feed their flocks there, each in his place. ", "4": "Make war against her. Rise up, let us go and fight her at noon. It is bad for us, for the day is passing! The shadows of the evening are longer! ", "5": "Rise up, let us go and fight in the night and destroy her strong houses!\u201d ", "6": "For the Lord of All says, \u201cCut down her trees, and build a battle-wall against Jerusalem. This is the city to be punished. There is nothing but a sinful power that makes hard times for others within her. ", "7": "As a well keeps its water good for drinking, so Jerusalem keeps going on in her sin. The sounds of those who fight and those who destroy are heard in her. Sickness and sorrow are always before Me. ", "8": "Listen about the danger, O Jerusalem, or I will become a stranger to you. I will make you a waste, a land with no people.\u201d", "9": "The Lord of All says, \u201cThey will gather all the people of Israel who are left like gathering from the vine. Pass your hand over the branches again like one who gathers grapes.\u201d ", "10": "Whom should I tell of the danger, that they may hear? See, their ears are closed and they cannot listen.

For both husband and wife will be taken, the old and those who have lived a very long time. ", "12": "Their houses, their fields and their wives will be given to others. I will put out My hand against the people of the land,\u201d says the Lord. ", "13": "\u201cFor from the least to the greatest of them, every one is always wanting something.

", "15": "Were they ashamed because of the sinful things they had done? No, they were not ashamed at all. They did not even know how to turn red. So they will fall among those who fall. When I punish them, they will be brought down,\u201d says the Lord.", "16": "The Lord says, \u201cStand by where the roads cross, and look. Ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it. And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'

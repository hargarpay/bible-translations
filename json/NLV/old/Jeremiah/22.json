", "3": "The Lord says, \u201cDo what is right and fair and good, and take the one who has been robbed away from the power of the one who has made it hard for him. Do not hurt or do wrong to the stranger, the one whose parents have died, or the woman whose husband has died. And do not kill those who are not guilty in this place. ", "4": "For if you will obey this word, then kings will come through the gates of this house and sit on the throne of David.

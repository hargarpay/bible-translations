{"1": "The Word of the Lord came to me, saying, ", "2": "\u201cDo not get married or have sons or daughters in this place.\u201d ", "3": "For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born in this land, and about their mothers who give birth to them, and their fathers who gave them life in this land: ", "4": "\u201cThey will die of bad diseases. No one will cry for them or bury them. They will be as animal waste on the ground, destroyed by sword and hunger. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the earth.\u201d", "5": "For the Lord says, \u201cDo not go into a house where the people have lost a loved one. Do not go to cry or to comfort them. For I have taken My peace, My loving-kindness and My pity from these people,\u201d says the Lord. ", "6": "\u201cBoth great men and small will die in this land. They will not be buried. No one will cry for them. And no one will cut himself or cut off his hair for them. ", "7": "No one will give food to comfort those who sorrow for the dead. And no one will give them the cup of comfort to drink even for the death of their father or mother.

What wrong have we done? What sin have we done against the Lord our God?' ", "11": "Then you tell them, 'It is because your fathers before you have turned away from Me,' says the Lord. 'They have followed other gods and served them and worshiped them. But they have left Me and have not kept My Law. ", "12": "And you have sinned even more than your fathers before you. For see, each one of you is following the strong-will of his own sinful heart instead of listening to Me.

Those who are to go hungry, to hunger, and those who are to be taken away as prisoners, to be taken away.'

At noon I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of young men. I will bring suffering and fear to them all at once. ", "9": "She who gave birth to seven sons will become weak and die. Her sun will set while it is still day, and she will be put to shame. I will give the rest of them to the sword in front of those who hate them,\u201d says the Lord.", "10": "It is bad for me, my mother, that you have given birth to me!

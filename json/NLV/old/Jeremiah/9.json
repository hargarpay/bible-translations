", "2": "If only I had a place in the desert for travelers to stay, that I might leave my people, and go away from them! For none of them are faithful. They are a gathering of men who cannot be trusted. ", "3": "\u201cThey use their tongue like their bow. Lies, and not truth, rule the land. For they go from sin to sin, and they do not know Me,\u201d says the Lord. ", "4": "\u201cLet every one watch his neighbor. Do not trust any brother. Because every brother sets traps, and every neighbor goes about hurting people with his talk. ", "5": "Every one fools his neighbor, and does not tell the truth. They have taught their tongue to tell lies. They become tired doing so many sins. ", "6": "You live in the center of false ways. In their false ways they are not willing to know Me,\u201d says the Lord.", "7": "So the Lord of All says, \u201cSee, I will make them pure and test them. For what else can I do with My people?

Why is the land destroyed and laid waste like a desert, so that no one passes through? ", "13": "And the Lord said, \u201cThey have turned away from My Law that I have given them. They have not obeyed My voice and would not be led by it.

And none of the people of Israel have had the sin cut from their heart.\u201d"}

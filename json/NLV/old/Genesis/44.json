", "2": "Put my silver cup in the bag of the youngest, with his money for the grain.\u201d And he did what Joseph had told him to do. ", "3": "Early in the morning the men were sent away with their donkeys. ", "4": "When they had left the city and were not far away, Joseph said to the man who took care of his house, \u201cGet up and follow the men.

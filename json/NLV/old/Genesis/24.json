{"1": "Now Abraham was old. He had lived many years. And the Lord had brought good to Abraham in every way. ", "2": "Abraham said to the oldest servant in his house and the one who took care of all that he owned, \u201cPlace your hand under my hip, ", "3": "and I will have you promise by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth. Promise that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, who live around me. ", "4": "But go to my country and to those of my family. Take a wife for my son Isaac from there.\u201d ", "5": "The servant said to Abraham, \u201cWhat if the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land? Should I take your son to the land you came from?\u201d ", "6": "Abraham said to him, \u201cMake sure that you do not take my son there. ", "7": "The Lord, the God of heaven, Who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, spoke to me and promised me. He said, 'I will give this land to your children and to their children's children.' He will send His angel in front of you. And you will take a wife for my son from there.

And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to get water. ", "14": "If I say to a girl, 'Let down your jar so that I may drink,' and she answers, 'Drink, and I will give water to your camels also,' let her be the one whom You have chosen for your servant Isaac. I will know by this that You have shown loving-kindness to my boss.\u201d", "15": "Before he had finished speaking, Rebekah came out, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah and Nahor, the brother of Abraham. She had a jar on her shoulder. ", "16": "The girl was very beautiful and had never lain with a man. She went down to the well, filled her jar and came up. ", "17": "Then the servant ran to meet her. He said, \u201cLet me drink a little water from your jar.\u201d ", "18": "She said, \u201cDrink, my lord.\u201d And she was quick to lift her jar to her hand and give him a drink. ", "19": "When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, \u201cI will get water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.\u201d ", "20": "She was quick to empty her jar into the animals' drinking place. Then she ran to the well for more water, and got enough for all his camels.", "21": "The man was quiet and watched her, waiting to know if the Lord had made all go well or not during his visit. ", "22": "When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a heavy gold ring and two heavy gold objects to wear on her arms. ", "23": "He said, \u201cWhose daughter are you? Tell me, is there a place for us to stay in your father's house?\u201d ", "24": "She said to him, \u201cI am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah and Nahor.\u201d ", "25": "She also said, \u201cWe have both enough straw and food, and a place to stay.\u201d ", "26": "Then the man bowed low and worshiped the Lord.

He has led me in the way to the house of my boss's brothers.\u201d", "28": "Then the girl ran and told about all this to those in her mother's house. ", "29": "Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. And Laban ran outside to the man at the well. ", "30": "When he saw the gold objects his sister was wearing, and heard his sister Rebekah saying, \u201cThis is what the man said to me,\u201d he went to the man. He saw him standing by the camels at the well. ", "31": "Laban said, \u201cCome in, you who receive good from the Lord! Why do you stand outside? I have made the house ready, and a place for the camels.\u201d ", "32": "So the man came into the house. Laban took the load off the camels, and gave them straw and food. He got water to wash the feet of Abraham's servant and the feet of the men who were with him. ", "33": "Then food was set in front of the man to eat. But he said, \u201cI will not eat until I have told you why I came here.\u201d Laban said, \u201cTell it.\u201d ", "34": "So he said, \u201cI am Abraham's servant. ", "35": "And the Lord has brought much good to my boss. He has become rich. The Lord has given him flocks and cattle, silver and gold, men and women servants, and camels and donkeys.

", "40": "He said to me, 'The Lord, Whom I have always obeyed, will send His angel with you to make all go well during your visit there. You will take a wife for my son from those of my family and from my father's house. ", "41": "Then you will be free from your promise to me. When you come to those of my family, and if they do not give her to you, then you will be free from your promise to me.'", "42": "\u201cSo I came to the well today. I said, 'O Lord, the God of my boss Abraham, may all go well during my visit here. ", "43": "See, I am standing by the well of water. If I say to the girl who comes out for water, \u201cLet me drink a little water from your jar,\u201d ", "44": "and she says, \u201cYou drink, and I will get water for your camels also,\u201d then let her be the woman whom the Lord has chosen for my boss's son.'

", "47": "Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah and Nahor.' And I put the gold objects on her nose and arms. ", "48": "Then I bowed low and worshiped the Lord. I gave honor and thanks to the Lord, the God of my boss Abraham. For He had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my boss's brother for his son. ", "49": "So now if you will show kindness and be true to my boss, tell me. And if not, tell me so I may know which way to turn.\u201d", "50": "Then Laban and Bethuel answered, \u201cThis thing comes from the Lord. We cannot speak for or against it.

Let her be the wife of your boss's son, as the Lord has spoken.\u201d ", "52": "When Abraham's servant heard their words, he put his face to the ground before the Lord. ", "53": "He brought out things made of silver and gold, and clothes, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave things of much worth to her brother and mother also.

When they got up in the morning, he said, \u201cSend me away to my boss.\u201d", "55": "But her brother and her mother said, \u201cLet the girl stay with us a few days, at least ten. Then she may go.\u201d ", "56": "But he said to them, \u201cDo not make me stay any more days, since the Lord has made my way go well. Send me away so I may go to my boss.\u201d ", "57": "They said, \u201cWe will call the girl and ask her what she wants to do.\u201d ", "58": "They called Rebekah and asked her, \u201cWill you go with this man?\u201d And she said, \u201cI will go.\u201d ", "59": "So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse.

May you become the mother of millions. May your children and all their children's children after them take over the cities of those who hate them.\u201d ", "61": "Then Rebekah and her servants got up on the camels and followed the man. So the servant of Abraham took Rebekah and left.", "62": "Now Isaac had come from Beerlahairoi, and was living in the Negev. ", "63": "Isaac had gone out to pray in the field in the evening. He looked up and saw that camels were coming. ", "64": "And Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac. She got off the camel ", "65": "and said to Abraham's servant, \u201cWho is that man walking in the field to meet us?\u201d Abraham's servant said, \u201cHe is my boss.\u201d So she took a cloth and covered her face.

So Isaac found comfort after his mother's death."}

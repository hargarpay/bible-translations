Go there and buy some for us, so we may live and not die.\u201d ", "3": "So ten of Joseph's brothers went to buy grain in Egypt. ", "4": "But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers. For he said, \u201cI am afraid that something will happen to him.\u201d", "5": "So the sons of Israel joined those who were coming to buy grain for there was no food in Canaan. ", "6": "Joseph was the ruler of the land. He was the one who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed to the ground in front of him. ", "7": "When Joseph saw his brothers, he knew who they were. But he acted like a stranger and spoke sharp words to them. He said, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d They answered, \u201cFrom the land of Canaan, to buy food.\u201d", "8": "Joseph knew his brothers but they did not know him.

Your servants are not working against you in secret.\u201d", "12": "He said to them, \u201cNo!

The youngest is now with our father. And one is no more.\u201d ", "14": "But Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is as I said. You are spies. ", "15": "You will be put to a test. By the life of Pharaoh, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. ", "16": "Send one of you to bring your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison. Your words will be put to a test to see if you are telling the truth. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, you are spies for sure.\u201d", "17": "He put them all together in prison for three days.

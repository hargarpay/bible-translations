", "3": "She brought up one of her little ones, and he became a lion. He learned to catch his food. He ate men. ", "4": "The nations heard about him, and he was caught in their trap. And they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. ", "5": "Your mother waited until she saw that her hope was lost. Then she took another of her little ones and made him a young lion. ", "6": "He walked up and down among the lions. He became a young lion and learned to catch his food. He ate men. ", "7": "He wrecked their strong towers and destroyed their cities. The land and all who were in it were filled with fear because of the loud noise he made. ", "8": "Then the nations came against him from their lands all around. They spread their net over him, and he was caught in their trap. ", "9": "They put him in a prison with chains and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison so that his voice would never be heard again on the mountains of Israel.", "10": "Your mother was like a vine in your grape-field, planted by the water. It gave much fruit and was full of branches because there was much water. ", "11": "Its branches were strong enough to be made into sticks held by rulers to show their power. It grew as high as the clouds. Everyone saw how high it was and that it had many branches. ", "12": "But it was pulled up by the roots in anger and thrown down to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was torn off so that it dried up. And fire destroyed it. ", "13": "Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. ", "14": "Fire has spread from its largest branch and has destroyed its young branches and its fruit. No strong branch is left on it to be made into a stick for a ruler.' This is a song of sorrow, and is to be used as a death song.\u201d"}

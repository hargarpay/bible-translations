The king of Babylon has shut Jerusalem in with his army this very day. ", "3": "And tell a picture-story to these sinful people of Israel. Tell them, 'The Lord God says, \u201cPut the pot on the fire. Put it on, and pour water in it. ", "4": "Put all the good pieces of meat in it, the thigh, the shoulder. And fill it with the best bones. ", "5": "Take the best of the flock. Put more and more wood under the pot to make it boil, and boil the bones in it.\u201d", "6": "'For the Lord God says, \u201cIt is bad for the city of blood, for the rusted pot whose rust has not been cleaned out of it! Take the pieces of meat out of it without choosing them. ", "7": "For the blood of the city has been poured on the rock. It was not poured on the ground where the dust would cover it. ", "8": "I have put the blood on the rock where it could not be covered, so that it would cause anger and punishment.\u201d ", "9": "So the Lord God says, \u201cIt is bad for the city of blood! I will put much wood on the fire. ", "10": "Put on more and more wood, and make the fire burn. Boil the meat well. Mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned up.

I have tried to make you clean, but you would not be made clean from your sins. So you will not be clean again until My anger against you is finished. ", "14": "I, the Lord, have spoken. The time has come for Me to act. I will not hold back, I will not pity, and I will not be sorry. I will punish you for your ways and for what you have done,\u201d says the Lord God.'\u201d", "15": "The Word of the Lord came to me saying, ", "16": "\u201cSon of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the desire of your eyes. But do not have sorrow or loud crying or any tears. ", "17": "Cry inside yourself. Do not show sorrow for the dead. Put your head-covering on. Put your shoes on your feet. Do not cover your face or eat the bread of those in sorrow.\u201d ", "18": "So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I was told.

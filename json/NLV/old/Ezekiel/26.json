{"1": "In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the Word of the Lord came to me saying, ", "2": "\u201cSon of man, Tyre has said this about Jerusalem, 'O, the gate to the nations is broken. It has opened to me. I will do well, now that she is laid waste.' ", "3": "So the Lord God says, 'I am against you, O Tyre. And I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. ", "4": "They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. Then I will clean away what is left from her and make her nothing but rock. ", "5": "She will be a place to spread fish nets out in the sea, for I have spoken,' says the Lord God. 'The nations will take her riches. ", "6": "And her villages on the land across the sea from her will be destroyed by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'", "7": "For the Lord God says, \u201cI will bring Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre from the north. He will come with horses, war-wagons, horsemen, and a large army. ", "8": "And he will kill with the sword those in your villages. He will build battle-walls around you. He will build up earth so they can go over your walls. He will build walls and make battle-coverings around you. ", "9": "He will roll down large objects to knock down your walls, and will break down your towers with axes. ", "10": "There will be so many horses that you will be covered by their dust. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wheels and war-wagons, when he comes through your gates as men come into a city that has been broken open. ", "11": "The feet of his horses will run all over your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. ", "12": "They will take your riches and good things as prizes of war. They will break down your walls and destroy your beautiful houses. And they will throw your stones and wood into the sea. ", "13": "I will put an end to the music of your songs. And the sound of your harps will be heard no more. ", "14": "I will make you nothing but rock. You will be a place for nets to be spread. You will never be built again, for I the Lord have spoken,\u201d says the Lord God.", "15": "The Lord God says to Tyre, \u201cWill not the lands beside the sea shake at the sound of your fall, when those who have been hurt cry in pain, when your people are killed? ", "16": "Then all the leaders of the sea will step down from their thrones and take off their beautiful clothing. They will clothe themselves with fear. They will sit on the ground and not be able to stop shaking, full of fear and wonder because of you. ", "17": "They will cry in sorrow for you and say, 'How you have been destroyed from the seas, O well-known city where many people once lived! You were powerful on the sea. You and all your people who lived here were filled with fear. ", "18": "Now the islands shake in fear on the day of your fall. Yes, the lands which are by the sea are afraid because of how you are destroyed.'\u201d ", "19": "The Lord God says, \u201cI will lay waste your city and make you like a destroyed city where no one lives. I will bring up the deep sea over you, and the many waters will cover you. ", "20": "Then I will send you down with those who go down to the grave, to the people of long ago. I will make you stay in the lower parts of the earth, like in waste places of long ago, with those who go down to the grave. So you will not have people living in you, and you will not have a place in the land of the living. ", "21": "I will fill you with fear and destroy you. People will look for you, but you will never be found again,\u201d says the Lord God."}

{"1": "On the first day of the third month in the eleventh year, the Word of the Lord came to me saying, ", "2": "\u201cSon of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his people, 'Who can be compared with you in greatness? ", "3": "Look at Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches and many leaves. It was very high, and its top was among the heavy branches. ", "4": "The waters made it grow, and the water under the ground made it grow high. Its rivers flowed all around its base, and spread water to all the trees of the field. ", "5": "So it was higher than all the trees of the field. And it grew many long and spreading branches because it had so much water. ", "6": "All the birds of the air made their nests in its branches. And under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth. All great nations lived in its shadow. ", "7": "It was beautiful in its greatness with its spreading branches, for its roots went down to much water. ", "8": "The cedars in God's garden could not compare with it. The fir trees and the chestnut trees could not compare with its branches. No tree in God's garden was like it in beauty. ", "9": "I made it beautiful with its many branches. And all the trees that were in Eden were jealous of it.", "10": "'So the Lord God says, \u201cBecause it has grown high with its top among the heavy branches, its heart has become proud, ", "11": "I will give it over to a powerful ruler of the nations, and he will punish it. Because of its sin, I will drive it out. ", "12": "Rulers from other nations will cut it down and leave it. Its branches will fall on the mountains and in all the valleys. Its spreading branches will be broken in all the deep valleys of the land. All the people of the earth will go away from its shadow and leave it.

For they have all been given over to death. They will go to the earth below, among men who die and go down to the grave.\u201d", "15": "'The Lord God says, \u201cWhen it goes down to the place of the dead, I will make the waters under the ground cover it in sorrow. I will stop its rivers of water and fill Lebanon with sorrow over it. All the trees of the field will waste away because of it.

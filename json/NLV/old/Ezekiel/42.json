", "3": "Over from the place in the inner open space which was as wide as twenty cubits, and over from the stone floor in the outer open space, was a walkway on the three floors, one above the other. ", "4": "In front of the rooms was an inside walkway as wide as ten cubits and as long as 100 cubits. Their doors were on the north. ", "5": "The upper rooms were smaller because the walkways took more away from them than from the rooms on the first and second floors of the building. ", "6": "For the rooms on all three floors had no pillars like the other buildings on the grounds. So the upper rooms were smaller than the ones on the first and second floors. ", "7": "There was an outside wall built beside the rooms toward the outer open space. It was in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. ", "8": "The rooms next to the outer open space were as long as fifty cubits, and those over from the Lord's house were as long as 100 cubits.

There they will lay the most holy things, the grain gift, the sin gift, and the guilt gift. For the place is holy. ", "14": "When the religious leaders go in, they are not to go out into the outer open space from the holy place without leaving behind the clothes they wear while they do the Lord's work, for these are holy. They must put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.\u201d", "15": "When he had finished showing me the lengths and widths of the inner house, he brought me out through the east gate. And he showed me the lengths of all the open space around the house. ", "16": "He showed me with his stick that the east side was as long as 500 sticks.

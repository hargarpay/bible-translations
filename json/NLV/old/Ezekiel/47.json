The water was flowing from under the right side of the house, from south of the altar. ", "2": "He brought me out through the north gate and led me around on the outside to the east gate. And I saw water coming from the south side.", "3": "Going toward the east, the man numbered 500 long steps, and he led me through the water, which covered my feet. ", "4": "He numbered another 500 long steps and led me through the water, which came up to my knees. He numbered another 500 long steps and led me through the water. This time it came above my legs. ", "5": "Again he numbered 500 long steps, and it was a river that I could not walk through. The water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, and no one could cross it. ", "6": "He said to me, \u201cSon of man, do you see this?\u201d Then he brought me back to the side of the river. ", "7": "As I returned, I saw that there were very many trees on both sides of the river. ", "8": "He said to me, \u201cThese waters go out toward the east country and down into the Arabah, then flow into the Dead sea. When they flow into the sea, the waters there become clean again. ", "9": "Every living thing that gathers where the river goes will live. There will be very many fish, because these waters go there and make the salt water clean. So everything will live where the river goes. ", "10": "Fishermen will stand beside it. They will have places to spread their nets from Engedi to Eneglaim. The fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. ", "11": "But its wet places and pools will not be good for animal life. They will be left for salt. ", "12": "All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not dry up, and they will never stop giving fruit. They will give fruit every month because their water flows from the holy place. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.\u201d", "13": "The Lord God says, \u201cThis is how you should divide the land among the twelve family groups of Israel. Joseph will have two parts. ", "14": "You must divide the land so each family receives the same amount. For I promised to give this land to your fathers, and it will be your land to own.", "15": "\u201cThis will be the side of the land: The north side will go from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon, and on to Zedad, ", "16": "Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (between the lands of Damascus and Hamath), and to Hazer-hatticon, by the land of Hauran. ", "17": "So the land will spread from the sea to Hazarenan on the north side of Damascus, with the land of Hamath toward the north. This will be the north side. ", "18": "The east side of the land will go from between Hauran and Damascus along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the sea in the east. This will be the east side. ", "19": "The south side of the land will go from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, then to the River of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This will be the south side. ", "20": "The west side of the land will be the Great Sea, to a place beside Lebo-hamath. This will be the west side.", "21": "\u201cSo divide this land among your family groups of Israel. ", "22": "Divide it by drawing names for yourselves and for the people from other lands who live with you and raise their children among you. You are to think of them as if they were born Israelites. They must be given a share of land with you among the families of Israel.

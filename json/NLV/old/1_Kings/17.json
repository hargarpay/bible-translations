{"1": "Now Elijah the Tishbite, of the people who were staying in Gilead, said to Ahab, \u201cAs the Lord the God of Israel lives, before Whom I stand, for sure there will be no rain or water on the grass in the early morning these years, except by my word.\u201d ", "2": "And the word of the Lord came to him, saying, ", "3": "\u201cLeave here and turn east. Hide yourself by the river Cherith, east of the Jordan. ", "4": "You will drink from the river. And I have told the ravens to bring food to you there.\u201d ", "5": "So he went and did what he was told by the word of the Lord. He went and lived by the river Cherith, east of the Jordan. ", "6": "The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and in the evening. And he drank from the river. ", "7": "But after a while, the river dried up, because there was no rain in the land.", "8": "Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, ", "9": "\u201cGet up and go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. I have told a woman there, whose husband has died, to feed you.\u201d ", "10": "So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he came to the city gate, he saw a woman there gathering sticks. He called to her and said, \u201cI ask of you, get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink.\u201d ", "11": "As she was going to get it, he called to her, \u201cI ask of you, bring me a piece of bread in your hand.\u201d ", "12": "But she said, \u201cAs the Lord your God lives, I have no bread. I only have enough flour in the jar to fill a hand, and a little oil in the jar. See, I am gathering a few sticks so I may go in and make it ready for me and my son. Then we will eat it and die.\u201d ", "13": "Elijah said to her, \u201cHave no fear. Go and do as you have said. But make me a little loaf of bread from it first, and bring it out to me. Then you may make one for yourself and for your son. ", "14": "For the Lord God of Israel says, 'The jar of flour will not be used up. And the jar of oil will not be empty, until the day the Lord sends rain upon the earth.'\u201d ", "15": "So she went and did what Elijah said. And she and he and those of her house ate for many days. ", "16": "The jar of flour was not used up, and the jar of oil did not become empty. It happened as was spoken by the word of the Lord through Elijah.", "17": "After this the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. His sickness was so bad that there was no breath left in him. ", "18": "So the woman said to Elijah, \u201cWhat do I have to do with you, O man of God? You have come to me to have my sin be remembered, and to kill my son!\u201d ", "19": "He said to her, \u201cGive me your son.\u201d Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the room on the second floor where he stayed. And he laid him on his own bed. ", "20": "He called to the Lord and said, \u201cO Lord my God, have You brought trouble to the woman I am staying with, by making her son die?\u201d ", "21": "Then he lay upon the child three times and called to the Lord, saying, \u201cO Lord my God, I pray to You. Let this child's life return to him.\u201d ", "22": "The Lord heard the voice of Elijah. And the life of the child returned to him and he became strong again. ", "23": "Elijah took the child and brought him down from the second floor into the house and gave him to his mother. He said, \u201cSee, your son is alive.\u201d ", "24": "Then the woman said to Elijah, \u201cNow I know that you are a man of God. Now I know that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\u201d"}

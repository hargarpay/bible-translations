{"1": "Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done. He told her how Elijah had killed with the sword all the men who spoke for Baal. ", "2": "Then Jezebel sent news to Elijah, saying, \u201cSo may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.\u201d ", "3": "Elijah was afraid. He got up and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba of Judah, he left his servant there. ", "4": "But he himself traveled for a day into the desert. He came and sat down under a juniper tree. There he asked that he might die, saying, \u201cIt is enough now, O Lord. Take my life. For I am not better than my fathers.\u201d ", "5": "When he lay down and slept under the juniper tree, an angel touched him. The angel said to him, \u201cGet up and eat.\u201d ", "6": "Then Elijah looked and saw by his head a loaf of bread made ready on hot stones, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again. ", "7": "The angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him, and said, \u201cGet up and eat. Because this traveling is too hard for you.\u201d ", "8": "So he got up and ate and drank. And he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.", "9": "He came to a cave, and stayed there. The word of the Lord came to him, and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Elijah?\u201d ", "10": "Elijah said, \u201cI have been very careful to serve the Lord, the God of All. For the people of Israel have turned away from Your agreement. They have torn down Your altars and have killed with the sword the men who speak for You. Only I am left, and they want to kill me.\u201d", "11": "So the angel said, \u201cGo and stand on the mountain before the Lord.\u201d And the Lord passed by. A strong wind tore through the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord. But the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind the earth shook. But the Lord was not in the shaking of the earth. ", "12": "After the earth shook, a fire came. But the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a sound of gentle blowing. ", "13": "When Elijah heard it, he put his coat over his face, and went out and stood at the opening of the hole. Then a voice came to him and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Elijah?\u201d ", "14": "He said, \u201cI have been very careful to serve the Lord, the God of All. For the people of Israel have turned away from Your agreement. They have torn down Your altars. And they have killed with the sword the men who speak for You. Only I am left, and they want to kill me.\u201d", "15": "The Lord said to him, \u201cGo, return on your way to the desert of Damascus. When you get there, set apart Hazael to be the king of Syria. ", "16": "Set apart Nimshi's son Jehu to be the king of Israel. And set apart Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah to speak for God in your place. ", "17": "Jehu will kill the one who gets away from the sword of Hazael. Elisha will kill the one who gets away from the sword of Jehu. ", "18": "But I will leave 7,000 in Israel whose knees have not bowed down in front of Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.\u201d", "19": "So Elijah left there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat. Elisha was plowing with twenty-four bulls, and was with the last two. Elijah passed by him and threw his coat on him. ", "20": "And he left the bulls and ran after Elijah and said, \u201cLet me kiss my father and mother. Then I will follow you.\u201d And Elijah said to him, \u201cReturn. For what have I done to you?\u201d ", "21": "So Elisha returned from following him. He took his two bulls and killed them. Then he boiled their flesh over a fire, burning the wood cross-pieces the bulls used to pull the load. And he gave the meat to the people, and they ate. Then Elisha got up and followed Elijah and served him."}

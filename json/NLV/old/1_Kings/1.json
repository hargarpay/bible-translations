And let her lie in your arms, that my lord the king may be warm.\u201d ", "3": "So they looked through all the land of Israel for a beautiful girl, and found Abishag the Shunammite. And they brought her to the king. ", "4": "The girl was very beautiful. She became the king's nurse and helped him. But the king did not have sex with her.", "5": "Now Haggith's son Adonijah honored himself, saying, \u201cI will be king.\u201d So he made war-wagons and horsemen ready for himself, with fifty men to run in front of him. ", "6": "His father had never troubled him at any time by asking, \u201cWhy have you done this?\u201d He was a very good-looking man also, and was born next after Absalom.

The earth shook with all the noise.", "41": "Adonijah and all who had been asked to be with him heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said, \u201cWhy is there such a noise in the city?\u201d ", "42": "While he was still speaking, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the religious leader came. Adonijah said, \u201cCome in, for you are a man to be trusted, and bring good news.\u201d ", "43": "But Jonathan said to Adonijah, \u201cNo! Our lord King David has made Solomon king.

{"1": "Watch your steps as you go to the house of God. Go near and listen but do not give the gift of fools. For they do not know they are sinning. ", "2": "Do not hurry to speak or be in a hurry as you think what to tell God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth. So let your words be few. ", "3": "For a dream comes with much work, and the voice of a fool comes with many words. ", "4": "When you make a promise to God, do not be late in paying it, for He is not pleased with fools. Pay what you promise to pay! ", "5": "It is better not to make a promise, than to make a promise and not pay it. ", "6": "Do not let your mouth cause you to sin. And do not say to the one sent from God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry because of what you said, and destroy the work of your hands? ", "7": "For when there are many dreams, there are many empty words. Instead of this, honor God with fear.", "8": "In one part of a land if you see a bad power held over the poor, and what is right and fair and good taken away, do not be surprised by what you see. For one leader watches over another leader, and more important leaders watch over them. ", "9": "After all, a country does better with a king in power.", "10": "He who loves money will never have enough money to make him happy. It is the same for the one who loves to get many things. This also is for nothing. ", "11": "When there are more good things, there are also more people to eat them. So what does their owner get except to see them with his eyes? ", "12": "The sleep of the working man is pleasing, if he eats little or much. But the full stomach of the rich man does not let him sleep.", "13": "There is something very wrong which I have seen under the sun: Riches being kept by the owner and he is hurt by them. ", "14": "When those riches are lost because he used them in a wrong way, and he had become the father of a son, there was nothing left for him. ", "15": "A man comes from his mother without clothing, and he will go as he came. He will take nothing from his work that he can carry in his hand. ", "16": "This also is very wrong: As a man is born, this is the way he will leave. So what does the man get who works for the wind? ", "17": "All his life he eats in darkness with much sorrow, sickness and anger.", "18": "This is what I have seen to be good and right: to eat and to drink and be happy in all the work one does under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him. For this is his reward. ", "19": "As for every man to whom God has given riches and many good things, He has also given him the power to eat from them, receive his reward and be happy in his work. This is the gift of God. ", "20": "For he will not think much about the years of his life, because God keeps him happy in his heart."}

I will fill him with fear so that all the people who are with him will run away. Then I will kill the king alone ", "3": "and return all the people to you. All will return if the man you want to kill is dead. Then all the people will be at peace.\u201d ", "4": "The plan pleased Absalom and all the leaders of Israel.", "5": "Then Absalom said, \u201cCall Hushai the Archite also. Let us hear what he has to say.\u201d ", "6": "When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, \u201cAhithophel has said this. Should we do as he says? If not, tell us.\u201d ", "7": "So Hushai said to Absalom, \u201cThis time what Ahithophel has said to do is not good.\u201d ", "8": "Hushai said, \u201cYou know your father and his men. They are powerful and angry, like a bear robbed of her young ones in the field. And your father is a very able man of war. He will not stay with the people during the night.

When some of the people are killed in the first battle, whoever hears it will say, 'There have been many people killed who follow Absalom.' ", "10": "Even the one who has strength of heart like the heart of a lion will be afraid. For all Israel knows that your father is a powerful man, and that those who are with him are men with strength of heart. ", "11": "But I say that all Israel should be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as much as the sand by the sea. And you yourself should go into battle. ", "12": "So we will find David wherever he is. We will fall on him like water falls on the ground in the early morning. And not he or any of the men with him will be left. ", "13": "If he runs into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city. We will pull it into the valley until not even a small stone is left there.\u201d ", "14": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, \u201cThe words of Hushai the Archite are better than the words of Ahithophel.\u201d In this way the Lord had planned to destroy the good leading of Ahithophel, so He might bring trouble to Absalom.", "15": "Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the religious leaders, \u201cThis is what Ahithophel said that Absalom and the leaders of Israel should do.

But cross over, or the king and all the people with him will be destroyed.'\u201d ", "17": "Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at Enrogel. And a woman servant would go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David. For they could not be seen coming into the city. ", "18": "But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. So the two of them left in a hurry and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in the open space in the center of his house. And they went down into it. ", "19": "Then the woman took the covering and spread it over the well's mouth, and spread grain on it, so nothing was known of it. ", "20": "Then Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, \u201cWhere are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\u201d The woman answered, \u201cThey have crossed the river.\u201d And after looking and not finding them, they returned to Jerusalem.", "21": "When they had left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan came up out of the well and went and told King David. They said to David, \u201cBe quick to get ready and cross over the water. For Ahithophel has told them to come against you.\u201d ", "22": "So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By the light of morning, not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan. ", "23": "When Ahithophel saw that his words were not followed, he got onto his donkey and went home to his city. He told those of his family what they must do, and he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's grave.", "24": "Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom and all the men of Israel with him crossed the Jordan. ", "25": "Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra the Israelite, who went in to Nahash's daughter Abigal, the sister of Joab's mother Zeruiah. ", "26": "And Israel and Absalom set up their tents in the land of Gilead.", "27": "When David had come to Mahanaim, he met Nahash's son Shobi from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, Ammiel's son Machir from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim. ", "28": "They brought him beds, washing pots, dishes, grain, flour, seeds, ", "29": "honey, sour milk, sheep, and cheese from the cattle, for David and his men to eat.

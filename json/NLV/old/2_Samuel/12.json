{"1": "Then the Lord sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said, \u201cThere were two men in one city. One was rich and the other was poor. ", "2": "The rich man had many flocks and cattle. ", "3": "But the poor man had nothing except one little female lamb which he bought and fed. It grew up together with him and his children. It would eat his bread and drink from his cup and lie in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. ", "4": "Now a traveler came to the rich man. But the rich man was not willing to take from his own flock or his own cattle, to make food for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man's female lamb and made it ready for the man who had come to him.\u201d ", "5": "David was very angry at the man, and said to Nathan, \u201cAs the Lord lives, for sure the man who has done this should die. ", "6": "And he must pay four times the worth of the lamb, because he did this thing without pity.\u201d", "7": "Nathan said to David, \u201cYou are the man! This is what the Lord God of Israel says: 'I chose you to be the king of Israel. I saved you from the hand of Saul. ", "8": "I gave you Saul's family and Saul's wives into your care. I gave you the nations of Israel and Judah. And if this were too little, I would give you as much more. ", "9": "Why have you hated the Word of the Lord by doing what is bad in His eyes? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword. You have taken his wife to be your wife. You have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon. ", "10": "So now some from your family, even in the future, will die by the sword, because you have turned against Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.' ", "11": "This is what the Lord says: 'See, I will bring trouble against you from your own family. I will take your wives in front of your eyes and give them to your neighbor. He will lie with your wives in the light of day. ", "12": "You did it in secret. But I will do this in front of all Israel, and under the sun.'\u201d ", "13": "Then David said to Nathan, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord.\u201d And Nathan said to him, \u201cThe Lord has taken away your sin. You will not die. ", "14": "But by this act you have given those who hate the Lord a reason to speak against the Lord. The child that is born to you will die for sure.\u201d ", "15": "Then Nathan went home. The Lord sent trouble upon the child of Uriah's wife and David, so that he was very sick. ", "16": "David begged God to make the child well. He went without food and lay all night on the ground. ", "17": "The leaders of his family stood beside him to lift him up from the ground. But David was not willing. He would not eat food with them. ", "18": "The child died on the seventh day. And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, \u201cSee, we spoke to him while the child was still alive, and he did not listen to us. So how can we tell him the child is dead? He might hurt himself.\u201d ", "19": "But when David saw his servants speaking together in secret, he understood that the child was dead. He asked his servants, \u201cIs the child dead?\u201d And they said, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d ", "20": "So David got up from the ground, washed, poured oil on himself, and changed his clothes. Then he came into the house of the Lord and worshiped. He returned to his own house and asked for food. So they set food in front of him, and he ate. ", "21": "Then his servants said to him, \u201cWhat is this that you have done? While the child was alive, you went without food and cried. But when the child died, you got up and ate food.\u201d ", "22": "David said, \u201cI went without food and cried while the child was still alive, for I said, 'Who knows? The Lord might be kind to me and let the child live.' ", "23": "But now he has died. Why should I go without food? Can I bring him to life again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.\u201d", "24": "Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went in and lay with her, and she gave birth to a son. He gave him the name Solomon. The Lord loved him, ", "25": "and sent word through Nathan who spoke for God. And Nathan gave him the name Jedidiah because of the Lord.", "26": "Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and took the king's city. ", "27": "Joab sent men to David, saying, \u201cI have fought against Rabbah. I have taken the city of waters. ", "28": "So gather the rest of the people together. Go against the city and take it, or I will take the city myself and it will be called by my name.\u201d ", "29": "So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah. He fought against it, and took it. ", "30": "Then he took the very heavy crown from their king's head. In it were beautiful stones of much worth. The crown was put on David's head. And he brought a large amount of things out of the city. ", "31": "He brought out the people who were in it also. He made them work with saws, sharp iron tools, and iron axes. And he made them work in the heat making building stones. He did this to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."}

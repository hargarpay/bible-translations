{"1": "Then Joab was told, \u201cSee, the king is crying. He is filled with sorrow for Absalom.\u201d ", "2": "So the happiness of winning the battle that day was changed to sorrow for all the people. For they heard that day, \u201cThe king is filled with sorrow for his son.\u201d ", "3": "So the people were quiet as they went in secret into the city that day. They acted like people who are ashamed when they run away from a battle. ", "4": "The king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, \u201cO my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d ", "5": "Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, \u201cToday you have covered the faces of all your servants with shame. Today they have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives and the women who act as your wives. ", "6": "But you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. You have shown today that rulers and servants are nothing to you. For today I see that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, you would be pleased. ", "7": "So now get up and go out and speak in kindness to your servants. I swear by the Lord that if you do not, for sure not a man will stay with you this night. And this will be worse for you than all the bad things that have happened to you since you were young.\u201d ", "8": "So the king got up and sat in the gate. When they told all the people, \u201cSee, the king is sitting in the gate,\u201d then all the people came to the king. Now every man of Israel had run to his tent. ", "9": "And all the people in all the family groups of Israel were arguing. They said, \u201cThe king saved us from those who hate us. He saved us from the Philistines. But now he has run from Absalom and away from the land. ", "10": "We chose Absalom to rule over us and he has died in battle. So now why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?\u201d", "11": "Then King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the religious leaders, saying, \u201cSpeak to the leaders of Judah. Say to them, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? I have heard from all Israel for me to return to my house. ", "12": "You are my brothers. You are my bone and my flesh. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?' ", "13": "And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be the captain of my army at all times instead of Joab.'\u201d ", "14": "He changed the hearts of all the men of Judah as if they were one man. So they sent word to the king, saying, \u201cReturn, you and all your servants.\u201d ", "15": "So the king returned and came as far as the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and bring him over the Jordan.", "16": "Then Gera's son Shimei, the Benjamite from Bahurim, came down in a hurry with the men of Judah to meet King David. ", "17": "There were 1,000 men of Benjamin with him. And Ziba the servant of the family of Saul came with his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the king at the Jordan. ", "18": "They crossed the river to bring over those of the king's house, and to do what pleased him. Gera's son Shimei fell down in front of the king as he was about to cross the Jordan.", "19": "He said to the king, \u201cLet not my lord think I am guilty. Do not remember what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king left Jerusalem. Let not the king take it to heart. ", "20": "For your servant knows that I have sinned. So I have come today. I am the first of all the family of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.\u201d ", "21": "But Zeruiah's son Abishai answered, \u201cShould not Shimei be put to death for this? He spoke against the Lord's chosen one.\u201d ", "22": "But David said, \u201cWhat have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? Why should you be against me this day? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that this day I am king of Israel?\u201d ", "23": "The king said to Shimei, \u201cYou will not die.\u201d And the king gave him his promise.", "24": "Then Saul's grandson Mephibosheth came down to meet the king. He had not dressed his feet, trimmed the hair of his face, or washed his clothes, from the day the king left until the day he returned in peace. ", "25": "When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, David said to him, \u201cWhy did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?\u201d ", "26": "He answered, \u201cO my lord the king, my servant lied to me. Your servant had said to him, 'Get a donkey ready for me to travel on, so I may go with the king.' Because your servant cannot walk. ", "27": "And he has spoken against me to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God. So do what you think is best. ", "28": "For all those of my father's house were nothing but dead men in front of my lord the king. But you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right do I have to complain any more to the king?\u201d ", "29": "The king said to him, \u201cWhy speak any more of how things are with you? I have decided that you and Ziba should divide the land.\u201d ", "30": "Mephibosheth said to the king, \u201cLet him take it all, since my lord the king has come home and is safe.\u201d", "31": "Now Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim. He went on to the Jordan with the king, to lead him over the river. ", "32": "Barzillai was eighty years old. He had given food to the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very rich man. ", "33": "The king said to Barzillai, \u201cYou cross over with me, and I will take care of you with me in Jerusalem.\u201d ", "34": "But Barzillai said to the king, \u201cHow much longer have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? ", "35": "I am now eighty years old. Can I know the difference between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear the voice of singing men and women any more? Why should your servant be an added problem to my lord the king? ", "36": "Your servant will only cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king reward me in this good way? ", "37": "Let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. And do for him what is good in your eyes.\u201d ", "38": "The king answered, \u201cChimham will cross over with me. And I will do for him what is pleasing to you. I will do for you whatever you ask.\u201d ", "39": "All the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king also. Then the king kissed Barzillai and prayed that good would come to him. And Barzillai returned to his own home.", "40": "The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him. And all the people of Judah and half the people of Israel went with the king.", "41": "Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him, \u201cWhy have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away? Why have they brought the king and those of his family over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?\u201d ", "42": "All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, \u201cBecause the king is a close brother to us. Why are you angry about this? Has the king paid for our food? Has he given us any gift?\u201d ", "43": "But the men of Israel said to the men of Judah, \u201cWe have ten shares in the king. So we have more right to David than you. Why then did you hate us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?\u201d But the words of the men of Judah had more anger than the words of the men of Israel."}

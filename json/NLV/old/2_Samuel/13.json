{"1": "Now David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar. And David's son Amnon loved her. ", "2": "Amnon was so troubled because of his sister Tamar that he became sick. She was a woman who had never had a man, and Amnon thought how hard it would be to have her. ", "3": "But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab. He was the son of David's brother Shimeah. And Jonadab was very good at making plans. ", "4": "He said to Amnon, \u201cO son of the king, why are you so sad from day to day? Will you not tell me?\u201d Amnon said to him, \u201cI am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.\u201d ", "5": "Then Jonadab said to him, \u201cLie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I beg you, let my sister Tamar come and give me some food to eat. Let her make food ready here so I can see it and eat it from her hand.'\u201d ", "6": "So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, \u201cI beg you, let my sister Tamar come and make two loaves beside me, that I may eat from her hand.\u201d", "7": "Then David sent home for Tamar, saying, \u201cGo now to your brother Amnon's house, and make food for him.\u201d ", "8": "So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house. He was lying down. And she took dough and made loaves so he could watch. Then she baked them ready to eat. ", "9": "And she took the dish and held it out in front of him. But he would not eat. Amnon said, \u201cHave everyone leave me.\u201d So everyone left him. ", "10": "Then Amnon said to Tamar, \u201cBring the food to my room, so I may eat from your hand.\u201d So Tamar took the loaves she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in his room. ", "11": "When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said, \u201cCome, lie with me, my sister.\u201d ", "12": "But she said, \u201cNo, my brother. Do not make me. For such a thing is not done in Israel. Do not do this bad and foolish thing! ", "13": "As for me, where could I get rid of my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. So now I beg you, speak to the king, for he will not keep me from you.\u201d ", "14": "But Amnon would not listen to her. Being stronger than she, he made her lay with him.", "15": "Then Amnon hated her very much. He hated her more than he had loved her. He said to her, \u201cGet up! Go away!\u201d ", "16": "But she said to him, \u201cNo! Sending me away is worse than what you have done to me!\u201d But he would not listen to her. ", "17": "He called the young man who helped him and said, \u201cThrow this woman out of my house, and lock the door behind her.\u201d ", "18": "Now she was wearing a dress which covered her arms. For this is how the king's daughters dressed when they had never had a man. The man who helped Amnon took her out and locked the door behind her. ", "19": "Then Tamar put ashes on her head. She tore the dress she was wearing which covered her arms. And she put her hand on her head and went away with a loud cry.", "20": "Absalom her brother said to her, \u201cHas your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet now, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this to heart.\u201d So Tamar stayed in her brother Absalom's house, sad and alone. ", "21": "When King David heard about all this, he was very angry. ", "22": "But Absalom did not speak good or bad to Amnon. Absalom hated Amnon because he had put his sister to shame.", "23": "After two full years, Absalom had men cut the wool from the sheep in Baal-hazor, near Ephraim. And Absalom asked all the king's sons to come. ", "24": "He came to the king and said, \u201cSee, your servant has men to cut the wool from the sheep. Let the king and his men go with your servant.\u201d ", "25": "But the king said to Absalom, \u201cNo, my son. We should not all go, or we will be trouble for you.\u201d Absalom tried to talk him into going. The king prayed that good would come to him, but he would not go with him. ", "26": "Then Absalom said, \u201cIf you will not go, let my brother Amnon go with us.\u201d And the king said to him, \u201cWhy should he go with you?\u201d ", "27": "But when Absalom kept asking him, he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.", "28": "Then Absalom told his servants, \u201cWatch when Amnon's heart is happy with wine. When I say to you, 'Kill Amnon,' then put him to death. Do not be afraid. Have not I myself told you to do it? Have strength of heart.\u201d ", "29": "So Absalom's servants did to Amnon just as Absalom had told them. Then all the king's sons got up on their horses and left in a hurry.", "30": "While they were on their way, the news came to David, saying, \u201cAbsalom has killed all the king's sons. Not one of them is left.\u201d ", "31": "The king got up and tore his clothes, and lay on the ground. And all his servants standing beside him tore their clothes. ", "32": "But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah, said, \u201cDo not let my lord think they have killed all the young men, the king's sons. Only Amnon is dead. Absalom has wanted to kill him since the day he put his sister Tamar to shame. ", "33": "So do not let my lord the king take this to heart and think that all the king's sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.\u201d", "34": "Now Absalom had run away. And the young man who kept watch looked up and saw many people coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. ", "35": "Jonadab said to the king, \u201cSee, the king's sons have come. What your servant said is true.\u201d ", "36": "As soon as he had finished speaking, the king's sons came and cried in a loud voice. The king and all his servants cried also.", "37": "Absalom ran away and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David was filled with sorrow for his son every day. ", "38": "So Absalom had run away to Geshur, and was there three years. ", "39": "The spirit of King David wanted very much to go out to Absalom. For he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead."}

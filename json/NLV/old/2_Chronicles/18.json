Ahab killed many sheep and cattle for him and for the people who were with him. And he wanted Jehoshaphat to fight against Ramoth-gilead. ", "3": "King Ahab of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, \u201cWill you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?\u201d He answered, \u201cI am as you are. And my people are as your people. We will be with you in the battle.\u201d", "4": "Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \u201cAsk first for word from the Lord.\u201d ", "5": "So the king of Israel gathered together the 400 men who told what would happen in the future. He said to them, \u201cShould we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or should I wait?\u201d And they said, \u201cGo up, for God will give it into the hand of the king.\u201d ", "6": "But Jehoshaphat said, \u201cIs there not another man who speaks for the Lord here whom we may ask?\u201d ", "7": "The king of Israel said to him, \u201cThere is yet one man whom we may ask of the Lord. But I hate him. For he never tells me anything good, only bad. He is Micaiah, the son of Imla.\u201d But Jehoshaphat said, \u201cYou should not say that.\u201d ", "8": "Then the king of Israel called for one of his captains and said, \u201cHurry, bring Micaiah the son of Imla.\u201d ", "9": "The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in king's clothing. They were sitting at the grain-floor at the gate of Samaria. All the men who told what would happen in the future were speaking in front of them.

For the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.\u201d", "12": "Then the man who was sent to call Micaiah said to him, \u201cSee, all the men who tell what will happen in the future are speaking in the king's favor. So I ask that you let your word be like one of them, and speak in the king's favor.\u201d ", "13": "But Micaiah said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, I will speak what my God says.\u201d ", "14": "When he came to the king, the king said to him, \u201cMicaiah, should we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or should I wait?\u201d Micaiah said, \u201cGo up and win the battle. For they will be given into your hand.\u201d ", "15": "Then the king said to him, \u201cHow many times must I tell you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?\u201d ", "16": "So he said, \u201cI saw all Israel spread out on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These have no owner. Let each of them return to his house in peace.'\u201d ", "17": "Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cDid I not tell you that he would not tell me anything good, but bad?\u201d ", "18": "Micaiah said, \u201cSo hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne. All the armies of heaven were standing on His right and on His left.

", "33": "But a certain man happened to shoot an arrow and hit the king of Israel in a joint of the battle-clothes. So the king said to the man on the war-wagon, \u201cTurn around, and take me out of the battle. For I am hurt.\u201d ", "34": "The battle was hard that day. And the king of Israel stood up against the sides of his war-wagon in front of the Syrians until the evening. When the sun went down, he died."}

", "6": "And he burned his sons as a gift in the valley of Ben-hinnom. He did witchcraft and asked the demon world about the future. He asked the demon world to do very special things, and he talked with people who spoke with the spirits of the dead. He did what was very bad in the eyes of the Lord, and made Him angry. ", "7": "Manasseh made an object to look like a false god, and put it in God's house, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, \u201cIn this house, and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all the families of Israel, I will put My name forever.

Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God.", "14": "After this he built the outside wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the Fish Gate. He built it around the Ophel, and made it very high. Then he put army captains in all the strong cities of Judah. ", "15": "He took away the strange gods and the false god from the house of the Lord. And he took away all the altars he had built on the mountain of the Lord's house and in Jerusalem, and threw them outside the city.

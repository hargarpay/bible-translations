They have built You a holy place in it for Your name, saying, ", "9": "'If what is bad comes upon us, fighting, hard times, disease, or no food, we will stand in front of this house. And we will stand before You, (for Your name is in this house). We will cry to You in our trouble. And You will hear and take us out of trouble.'

But our eyes look to You.\u201d ", "13": "And all the men of Judah were standing before the Lord, with their babies, their wives, and their children.", "14": "Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite of the sons of Asaph, as he stood among the people. ", "15": "He said, \u201cListen, all Judah, the people of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. The Lord says to you, 'Do not be afraid or troubled because of these many men. For the battle is not yours but God's. ", "16": "Go down to fight them tomorrow. See, they will come up by the hill of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, in front of the desert of Jeruel. ", "17": "You will not need to fight in this battle. Just stand still in your places and see the saving power of the Lord work for you, O Judah and Jerusalem.' Do not be afraid or troubled. Go out against them tomorrow, for the Lord is with you.\u201d ", "18": "Then Jehoshaphat put his face to the ground. And all Judah and the people of Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord.

And when they finished with the people of Seir, they all helped to kill each other.", "24": "Judah came to the place where they could look out over the desert. When they looked toward the armies, they saw that dead bodies were lying on the ground. No one had been left alive. ", "25": "So Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away what they wanted from them. They found cattle, many good things, clothing, and things of great worth, which they took for themselves. There was more than they could carry. It took them three days to take all the things, because there was so much. ", "26": "They gathered together in the Valley of Beracah on the fourth day. There they praised and thanked the Lord. So the name of that place has been the Valley of Beracah to this day. ", "27": "Then every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Jehoshaphat leading them. They returned to Jerusalem with joy. For the Lord had filled them with joy by saving them from those who hated them.

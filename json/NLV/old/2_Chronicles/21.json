", "3": "Their father gave them many gifts of silver, gold, and things of much worth. He gave them strong cities in Judah. But he made Jehoram king, because he was the first-born.", "4": "Now when Jehoram had become king in the place of his father, and had made himself strong, he killed all his brothers with the sword. He killed some of the leaders of Israel also. ", "5": "Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king. And he ruled for eight years in Jerusalem. ", "6": "He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as those of Ahab's house did. (For Ahab's daughter was his wife.) He did what was sinful in the eyes of the Lord.

His mother's name was Athaliah, the grand-daughter of Omri. ", "3": "Ahaziah walked in the ways of those of Ahab's house. For his mother talked him into doing sinful things. ", "4": "He did what was sinful in the eyes of the Lord, as those of Ahab's house had done. For after his father's death, they talked with him about what to do, and so caused him to be destroyed. ", "5": "He did what they told him to do. He went with Jehoram the son of King Ahab of Israel to fight a war against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. But the Syrians hurt Jehoram. ", "6": "So he returned to Jezreel to be healed of the cuts he had received at Ramah, when he fought against King Hazael of Syria.

These captains were Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. They made an agreement with Jehoiada. ", "2": "And they went through Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities. They gathered the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel. And they came to Jerusalem. ", "3": "Then all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of God. Jehoiada said to them, \u201cSee, the king's son will rule, as the Lord has spoken about the sons of David. ", "4": "This is what you must do. One third of you religious leaders and Levites who come in on the Day of Rest will watch the gates. ", "5": "One third will be at the king's house, and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people will be in the open places of the house of the Lord. ", "6": "But let no one come into the house of the Lord except the religious leaders and the Levite helpers. They may come in, for they are holy. But let all the other people obey the law against going into the holy place of the Lord. ", "7": "The Levites will stand around the king. Each one will have his spear in his hand. And whoever goes into the house will be killed. Be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.\u201d", "8": "The Levites and all Judah did all that Jehoiada the religious leader told them. Each one of them took his men who were to come in on the Day of Rest, with those who were to go out on the Day of Rest. For Jehoiada the religious leader did not send away any of the groups. ", "9": "Then Jehoiada the religious leader gave the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small battle-coverings that had been King David's, which were in the house of God. ", "10": "And he put all the people in their places around the king. Each man had his spear in his hand. They were put in their places from the right side of the house to the left side, around the altar and the house. ", "11": "Then they brought out the king's son and put the crown on him. They gave him the Law, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons poured oil on him and said, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d", "12": "When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came into the house of the Lord to the people. ", "13": "She looked and saw the king beside his pillar at the gate. The captains and those who blew the horns were beside the king. And all the people of the land were filled with joy and blew horns. The singers were playing music and leading the praise. Athaliah tore her clothes and called out, \u201cThey are turning against the queen!\u201d ", "14": "Then Jehoiada the religious leader brought out the captains of hundreds who were over the army, and said to them, \u201cBring her out from among the groups of people. And kill with the sword whoever follows her.\u201d For the religious leader said, \u201cDo not kill her in the house of the Lord.\u201d ", "15": "So they took hold of her. And when she came to the Horse Gate of the king's house, they killed her there.", "16": "Then Jehoiada made an agreement between himself and all the people and the king, that they should be the Lord's people. ", "17": "All the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down. They broke in pieces his altars and the objects made to look like him. And they killed Mattan the religious leader of Baal in front of the altars. ", "18": "Then Jehoiada put the duties of the Lord's house under the care of the religious leaders and the Levites. David had chosen them to take care of the Lord's house. They were to give the burnt gifts of the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses. It was to be done with joy and singing, as David had told them. ", "19": "And Jehoiada put the gate-keepers in their places of the Lord's house. This was so no one would go in who was in any way unclean. ", "20": "Then he took the captains of hundreds, the princes, the leaders of the people, and all the people of the land. And they brought the king down from the house of the Lord. They came through the high gate to the king's house. And they placed the king upon the throne of the nation. ", "21": "So all the people of the land were filled with joy, and the city was quiet. For they had killed Athaliah with the sword."}

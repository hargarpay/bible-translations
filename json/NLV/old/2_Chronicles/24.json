{"1": "Joash was seven years old when he became king. And he ruled forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba. ", "2": "Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the religious leader. ", "3": "Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.", "4": "After this Joash decided to do the work that was needed on the Lord's house. ", "5": "He gathered the religious leaders and Levites, and said to them, \u201cGo out to the cities of Judah. And gather money from all Israel to pay for the work needed to be done on the house of your God from year to year. Be quick about it.\u201d But the Levites did not hurry. ", "6": "So the king called for Jehoiada the head religious leader, and said to him, \u201cWhy have you not made the Levites bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax set by Moses the Lord's servant? All the people of Israel were to pay taxes for the tent of the Law.\u201d ", "7": "For the sons of that sinful woman Athaliah had broken into the house of God. They even used the holy things of the Lord's house for the false gods of Baal.", "8": "So the king had them make a box and set it outside by the gate of the Lord's house. ", "9": "And they made it known in Judah and Jerusalem that the tax set by God's servant Moses on Israel in the desert must be brought to the Lord. ", "10": "Then all the leaders and all the people were filled with joy. They brought in their taxes and put the money into the box until they had finished. ", "11": "The Levites would bring the box in to the king's helper. And when they saw that there was much money, the king's writer and the head religious leader's helper would come and empty the box. They would take out the money and return the box to its place. They did this each day, and gathered much money. ", "12": "The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who watched over the work being done on the Lord's house. They paid those who worked with stone and wood and iron and brass, for the work done on the Lord's house. ", "13": "So the workmen worked hard doing what needed to be done. The house of God was like new again, just as it was planned. They made it strong. ", "14": "When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada. From it were made the objects used in the Lord's house. These things were made for the worship and the burnt gifts. Then dishes and pots of gold and silver were made. And they gave burnt gifts in the house of the Lord all the time, all the days of Jehoiada.", "15": "When Jehoiada had lived a long time, he died. He died when he was 130 years old. ", "16": "They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done well in Israel, and to God and His house. ", "17": "But after the death of Jehoiada, the leaders of Judah came and bowed down in front of the king. And the king listened to them. ", "18": "They left the house of the Lord the God of their fathers, and worshiped the false gods of Asherah and the objects made to look like them. So anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their sin. ", "19": "Yet God sent men who speak for God to bring them back to the Lord. These men of God spoke against them, but they would not listen. ", "20": "Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the religious leader. He stood where he could be seen by the people and said to them, \u201cGod says, 'Why do you sin against the Laws of the Lord, and bring trouble on yourselves? Because you have left the Lord, He has left you.'\u201d ", "21": "So they made plans against him. At the king's word, they killed Zechariah with stones in the open space of the Lord's house. ", "22": "So Joash the king did not remember the kindness his father Jehoiada had shown him, but he killed his son. And when Zechariah was dying, he said, \u201cMay the Lord see and punish!\u201d", "23": "At the end of the year the army of the Syrians came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders of the people. And they sent all they had taken in battle to the king of Damascus. ", "24": "The army of the Syrians came with a small number of men. But the Lord let them win against a very large army. Because the people of Judah and Jerusalem had turned away from the Lord, the God of their fathers. So the Syrians were used to punish Joash. ", "25": "When they had left Joash, leaving him very sick, his own servants made plans against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the religious leader. And they killed him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David. But they did not bury him in the graves of the kings. ", "26": "The men who made plans against Joash were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. ", "27": "Now the story of his sons, and the words spoken by wise men against him, and the work done on the house of God, are written in the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah became king in his place."}

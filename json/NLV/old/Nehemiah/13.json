They had before used the room to store the grain gifts, special perfume, dishes, and the tenth part of grain, wine and oil to be given to the Levites, the singers and the gate-keepers, and the gifts for the religious leaders. ", "6": "But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem. For in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I had gone to the king. Then after some time, I asked the king to let me go, ", "7": "and came to Jerusalem. I learned about the sinful thing Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by giving a room for him in the house of God. ", "8": "I was very angry, and threw all the things of Tobiah's house out of the room. ", "9": "Then I said that the rooms must be made clean, and put back the things of the house of God with the grain gifts and the special perfume.", "10": "I also learned that what was to be given to the Levites had not been given. So the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to their own fields.

Do not forget my good works which I have done for the house of my God and His worship.", "15": "In those days I saw in Judah some who were crushing grapes to make wine on the Day of Rest. I saw them bringing in bags of grain and loading them on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads. And they brought them into Jerusalem on the Day of Rest. So I spoke sharp words to them on the day they sold food. ", "16": "Men of Tyre were living there who brought in fish and all kinds of things to sell. They sold them to the people of Judah on the Day of Rest, even in Jerusalem. ", "17": "Then I spoke sharp words to the leaders of Judah, saying, \u201cWhat is this sinful thing you are doing by not keeping the Day of Rest holy? ", "18": "Did not your fathers do the same, so that our God brought all this trouble to us and to this city? Yet you are bringing more anger to Israel by not keeping the Day of Rest holy.\u201d", "19": "Just as it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Day of Rest, I had them shut the doors.

So I drove him away from me. ", "29": "Remember them, O my God, because they have brought sin to the religious leaders and to the agreement of the religious leaders and the Levites.", "30": "So I made them free from the sin of other nations. I gave the religious leaders and the Levites their duties, each in his work. ", "31": "And I saw to it that wood would be brought at the right times, and also the first-fruits.

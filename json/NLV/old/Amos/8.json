", "2": "And the Lord said, \u201cWhat do you see, Amos?\u201d I said, \u201cA basket of summer fruit.\u201d Then the Lord said to me, \u201cThe end has come for My people Israel. I will not change My mind again about punishing them. ", "3": "The songs of the king's house will become loud cries of sorrow on that day,\u201d says the Lord God. \u201cThere will be many dead bodies. In every place they will be thrown out without a word.\u201d", "4": "Hear this, you who crush under foot those who are in need, to put an end to the poor of the land. ", "5": "You say, \u201cWhen will the New Moon be over, so that we may buy grain? When will the Day of Rest be over, so that we may open the store and sell grain? Then we will make the basket smaller and the weight bigger, and we will lie about the weight. ", "6": "We will buy the poor for money, and those in need for shoes. And we will sell the part of the grain that is of no worth.\u201d", "7": "The Lord has promised by the pride of Jacob, \u201cFor sure I will never forget anything they have done.

I will fill that time with sorrow, as if an only son had died. And the end of it will be like a bitter day.", "11": "\u201cThe days are coming,\u201d says the Lord God, \u201cwhen I will send a time upon the land when the people will be very hungry. They will not be hungry for bread or thirsty for water, but they will be hungry to hear the Words of the Lord. ", "12": "People will go from sea to sea, and from the north to the east. They will go from place to place to look for the Word of the Lord, but they will not find it.

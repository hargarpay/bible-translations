Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword. Not one of them will get away. ", "2": "Even if they dig into the place of the dead, My hand will take them from there. Even if they go up to heaven, I will bring them down from there. ", "3": "Even if they hide on the top of Mount Carmel, I will find them and take them from there. Even if they hide themselves from My eyes on the bottom of the sea, there I will tell the large sea-snake to bite them. ", "4": "Even if they are taken away to a strange land by those who hate them, there I will have the sword kill them. I will set My eyes against them to hurt them, and not to bring good to them.\u201d", "5": "The Lord God of All is the One Who touches the land and it melts. All those who live in it are filled with sorrow. All of it rises and falls like the Nile River of Egypt. ", "6": "The Lord builds His upper rooms in the heavens and sets His sky over the earth. He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the earth.

And they will make gardens and eat their fruit. ", "15": "I will plant My people on their land. And they will never again be pulled up from the land I gave them,\u201d says the Lord your God."}

{"1": "After these things, when King Ahasuerus was no longer angry, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and what had been decided against her. ", "2": "Then the king's servants who served him said, \u201cLet beautiful young women be found for the king. ", "3": "Let the king choose men to watch over all the parts of his nation, that they may gather every beautiful young woman who has never had a man to the city of Susa. Have them brought to the house for the king's wives, under the care of Hegai, the king's servant, who takes care of the women. And let their things for making them beautiful be given to them. ", "4": "Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti.\u201d This pleased the king, and he did so.", "5": "Now in the city of Susa where the king lived there was a Jew whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite. ", "6": "He had been taken from Jerusalem with the people who had been taken away with King Jeconiah of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon. ", "7": "He had brought up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his father's brother. For she did not have a father or mother. The young lady was beautiful in body and face. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.", "8": "The words of the king were made known, and many young ladies were gathered to the city of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. So Esther was taken to the king's house into the care of Hegai, who cared for the women. ", "9": "Now the young lady pleased Hegai and she found favor with him. He was quick to give her oils and special food, and gave her seven of the best women servants from the king's special house. He moved her and her women servants to the best place in the house for the king's wives. ", "10": "Esther had not told who her people or her family were because Mordecai had told her to say nothing. ", "11": "And every day Mordecai walked in front of the open space of the house of the king's women to learn how Esther was and how she was getting along.", "12": "The time for each young lady came to go in to King Ahasuerus after the end of her twelve months of being under the rules for the women. The days of making themselves beautiful were finished after using oil from spices for six months, and perfumes and oils for making themselves beautiful for another six months. ", "13": "When the young woman went in to the king, whatever she wanted was given to her to take from the house of the king's women to the king's special house. ", "14": "In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second house for the king's women, into the care of Shaashgaz, the king's servant who took care of his women who acted as wives. She would not go in to the king again unless the king was pleased with her and she was called by name. ", "15": "Now the turn came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the brother of the father of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king. She did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king's servant who took care of the women, said she should take. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.", "16": "So Esther was taken to the beautiful house of King Ahasuerus in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his rule. ", "17": "And the king loved Esther more than all the women. She found favor and kindness with him more than all the young women, so that he set the queen's crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. ", "18": "Then the king gave a great supper for all his princes and leaders. It was a special supper for Esther. He also made a special day for the nation, and gave many gifts.", "19": "When the young women were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate. ", "20": "Esther had not yet told who her family or her people were, as Mordecai had said. For she did what Mordecai told her just as she had done when she was under his care. ", "21": "In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's servants from those who watched over the door, became angry. And they planned to kill King Ahasuerus. ", "22": "But their plan became known to Mordecai and he told Queen Esther. And Esther told the king what Mordecai had heard. ", "23": "When the plan was learned and found to be true, both men were hanged on a tree. It was written down in the Book of the Chronicles in front of the king."}

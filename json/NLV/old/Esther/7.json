", "2": "And the king said again to Esther on the second day, as they drank their wine at the special supper, \u201cWhat do you want to ask of me, Queen Esther? It will be done for you. What do you want? You would be given as much as half the nation.\u201d ", "3": "Queen Esther answered, \u201cIf I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if it please the king, I ask that my life and the lives of my people be saved. ", "4": "For I and my people have been sold, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be done away with. If we had only been sold as men and women servants, I would have kept quiet.

", "2": "He went as far as the king's gate, for no one was to go through the king's gate wearing cloth made from hair. ", "3": "There was much sorrow among the Jews in each and every part of the nation where the king's law was made known. They went without food and cried with sounds of sorrow. Many lay in cloth made from hair and in ashes.", "4": "Then Esther's women and men servants came and told her, and the queen was very troubled. She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear, that he might take off his clothes made from hair. But he would not take them.

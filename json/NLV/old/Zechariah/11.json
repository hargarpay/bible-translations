Listen to the sound of the young lions, for the trees along the valley of the Jordan River lay waste.", "4": "The Lord my God said, \u201cTake care of the flock that is to be killed. ", "5": "Those who buy them kill them and are not punished. And those who sell them say, 'Thanks and honor be to the Lord, for I have become rich!' Their own shepherds have no pity on them. ", "6": "For I will no longer have pity on the people who live in this land,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cI will give everyone over to the power of his neighbor and his king. They will bring trouble to the land, and I will not save them from their power.\u201d", "7": "So I took care of the flock that was to be killed, and those of the flock who suffered. I took two walking sticks. One I called Favor, and the other I called Agreement. I took care of the flock. ", "8": "I destroyed the three shepherds in one month.

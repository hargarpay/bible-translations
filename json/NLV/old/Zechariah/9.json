", "2": "The Word of the Lord is against Hamath also, which is beside Hadrach, and against Tyre and Sidon, even though they are very wise. ", "3": "For Tyre built a strong tower for herself. She gathered silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets. ", "4": "But the Lord will take away her riches and throw them into the sea. And she will be destroyed by fire. ", "5": "Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza will suffer with much pain. So will Ekron, for her hope will be destroyed. Gaza will lose her king, and no one will live in Ashkelon. ", "6": "A mixed people will live in Ashdod, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines. ", "7": "I will take the blood from their mouths, and the unclean food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God, and be like a family in Judah. Ekron will be like the Jebusites. ", "8": "Then I will camp around My land and keep armies from going through it. No one will make it hard for them again, for now I am keeping watch.", "9": "Be full of joy, O people of Zion! Call out in a loud voice, O people of Jerusalem! See, your King is coming to you. He is fair and good and has the power to save. He is not proud and sits on a donkey, on the son of a female donkey. ", "10": "I will destroy the war-wagon from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem. The battle-bow will be broken. He will make peace among the nations and rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.", "11": "As for you, because of the blood of My agreement with you, I have set your people free from the deep hole that has no water.

", "15": "The Lord of All will fight for them, and they will destroy, and walk on the stones that were to be thrown at them. They will drink and make much noise as with wine. They will be filled like a cup used for putting blood on the corners of the altar. ", "16": "The Lord their God will save them on that day as the flock of His people. For they are like the stones of a crown, shining in His land. ", "17": "How good and how beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men grow strong. And the young, pure women will grow strong with new wine."}

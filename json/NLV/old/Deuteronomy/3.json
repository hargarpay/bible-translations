{"1": "\u201cThen we turned and went up the road to Bashan. Og king of Bashan and all his people came out to meet us in battle. ", "2": "But the Lord said to me, 'Do not be afraid of him. For I have given him and all his people and his land to you. Do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon.' ", "3": "So the Lord our God gave us Og king of Bashan and all his people also. We destroyed them until no one was left alive. ", "4": "And we took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them. We took sixty cities, the whole land of Argob, the nation of Og in Bashan. ", "5": "All these cities were built strong, with high walls, gates and iron. There were many towns without walls also. ", "6": "We destroyed them, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon. We destroyed every man, woman and child in every city. ", "7": "But we took for ourselves all the animals and what was left in the cities. ", "8": "So we took the land at that time from the two kings of the Amorites who were on the east side of the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon ", "9": "(Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir). ", "10": "We took all the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the nation of Og in Bashan. ", "11": "(For only Og king of Bashan was left of the children of the Rephaim. His bed was made of iron. It is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. It was as long as five steps, and as wide as two long steps.)", "12": "\u201cSo we took this land for ourselves at that time. I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the land from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead. ", "13": "I gave to the half-family of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the nation of Og, all the land of Argob. It is called the land of Rephaim. ", "14": "Manasseh's son Jair took all the land of Argob as far as the land of the Geshurites and the Maacathites. He called Bashan after his own name, Havvothjair. And that is its name to this day. ", "15": "I gave Gilead to Machir. ", "16": "To the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead to the valley of Arnon, from the center of the valley to the river Jabbok, beside the Ammonites. ", "17": "I gave them the Arabah also, with the Jordan as its west side, from Chinnereth as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the bottom of the hills of Pisgah on the east.", "18": "\u201cAt that time I told you, 'The Lord your God has given you this land for your own. All you men with strength of heart will cross over ready to fight before your brothers, the sons of Israel. ", "19": "But your wives, your little ones and your animals (I know you have many animals) will stay in your cities that I have given you. ", "20": "They will stay until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and until they own the land the Lord your God will give them on the other side of the Jordan. Then every one of you may return to what is his, which I have given you.' ", "21": "And then I told Joshua, 'Your eyes have seen all the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the nations through which you pass. ", "22": "Do not be afraid of them. For the Lord your God is the One fighting for you.'", "23": "\u201cAfter that I begged the Lord, ", "24": "'O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your great power and Your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and powerful acts as You do? ", "25": "I ask of You, let me cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.' ", "26": "But the Lord was angry with me because of you. He would not listen to me. The Lord told me, 'Enough! Speak to Me no more about this. ", "27": "Go up to the top of Pisgah, and look to the west and north and south and east. See it with your eyes, for you will not cross over this Jordan. ", "28": "But tell Joshua what is to be done. Comfort him and give him strength. For he will cross in front of this people. And he will give them for their own the land that you will see.' ", "29": "So we stayed in the valley beside Beth-peor."}

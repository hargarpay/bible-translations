", "5": "On the other side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses talked to the people about this Law. He said, ", "6": "\u201cThe Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Sinai, saying, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain. ", "7": "Get ready to travel now. Go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the valley, in the Negev and by the sea, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the big river, the river Euphrates.

And I will make them leaders over you.' ", "14": "You answered me and said, 'The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.' ", "15": "So I took the leaders of your family groups, wise and able men. I made them leaders over you, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and rulers of your family groups.", "16": "\u201cThen I said to your judges at that time, 'Listen to the problems between your brothers. And be right in what you decide between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him. ", "17": "Do not show favor as you judge. Listen to the small and the great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, because you are judging for God. Bring to me any problem that is too hard for you, and I will hear it.'

Our brothers have made our hearts weak with fear, saying, 'The people are bigger and taller than we. The cities are large, with walls as high as the heavens. And we have even seen the sons of the Anakim there.'\u201d ", "29": "Then I said to you, 'Do not be afraid of them. ", "30": "The Lord your God Who goes before you will Himself fight for you.

There you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way you have walked until you came to this place.' ", "32": "But even so, you did not trust the Lord your God, ", "33": "Who goes before you on your way. He finds a place for you to set up your tents. He uses fire to show you the way to go during the night. During the day He uses a cloud to lead you.", "34": "\u201cThe Lord heard your words and was angry. He swore, ", "35": "'Not one of these men of these sinful people will see the good land I promised to give your fathers, ", "36": "except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it.

You would be destroyed by those who hate you.\u201d' ", "43": "So I spoke to you but you would not listen. You went against what the Lord told you. In your pride you went up into the hill country.

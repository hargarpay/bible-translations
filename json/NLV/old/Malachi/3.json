The one with the news of the agreement, whom you desire, is coming,\u201d says the Lord of All. ", "2": "\u201cBut who can live through the day of His coming? Who can stand when He shows Himself? For He is like a fire for making gold pure, and like a strong cleaner. ", "3": "He will sit as one who melts silver and makes it pure. He will make the sons of Levi pure. He will make them pure like gold and silver, so that they may bring the right gifts to the Lord. ", "4": "Then the gifts of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as they were in the past. ", "5": "Then I will come to judge you. I will be quick to speak against those who use witchcraft, and those who do sex sins, and those who make false promises. I will speak against those who do not pay a man what he has earned, and who make it hard for the woman whose husband has died and for children who have no parents. And I will speak against those who turn away the stranger and do not fear Me,\u201d says the Lord of All.", "6": "\u201cFor I, the Lord, do not change. So you, O children of Jacob, are not destroyed.", "7": "\u201cFrom the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My Laws and have not obeyed them.

But you say, 'How have we robbed You?' You have not given Me the tenth part of what you receive and your gifts. ", "9": "You are cursed, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation of you! ", "10": "Bring the tenth part into the store-house, so that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this,\u201d says the Lord of All. \u201cSee if I will not then open the windows of heaven and pour out good things for you until there is no more need.

Not only are sinners doing well, but they put God to the test and get away with it.'\u201d", "16": "Then those who feared the Lord spoke often to one another, and the Lord listened to them. And the names of those who worshiped the Lord and honored Him were written down before Him in a Book to be remembered.

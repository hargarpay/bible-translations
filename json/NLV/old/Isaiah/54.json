Yes, you will have more children than the one who has a husband,\u201d says the Lord. ", "2": "\u201cMake your tent bigger. Spread out the curtains of your home, and do not hold back. Make your ropes longer and your tie-downs stronger. ", "3": "For you will spread out to the right and to the left. Your children will own nations, and they will fill the destroyed cities with people.", "4": "\u201cFear not, for you will not be ashamed. Do not be troubled, for you will not be put to shame. You will forget how you were ashamed when you were young. You will not remember the sorrow of being without a husband any more. ", "5": "Your Maker is your husband. His name is the Lord of All. And the One Who saves you is the Holy One of Israel. He is called the God of All the earth.

", "7": "\u201cFor a short time I left you, but with much loving-pity I will take you back. ", "8": "When I was very angry I hid My face from you for a short time. But with loving-kindness that lasts forever I will have pity on you,\u201d says the Lord Who bought you and saves you.", "9": "\u201cFor this is like the days of Noah to Me. As I promised that the waters of Noah should not flood the earth again, so I have promised that I will not be angry with you or speak sharp words to you.

No one over you will make it hard for you, and you will not be afraid. You will be far from trouble, for it will not come near you. ", "15": "If anyone brings trouble against you, it will not be from Me. Whoever comes against you will fall because of you. ", "16": "See, I Myself have made the workman who blows on the fire to give it more heat and makes a sword for its work. I have made the destroyer to destroy. ", "17": "No tool that is made to fight against you will do well. And you will prove wrong every tongue that says you are guilty. This is the gift given to the servants of the Lord. I take away their guilt and make them right,\u201d says the Lord."}

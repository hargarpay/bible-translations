For your wrong-doing your mother was sent away. ", "2": "Why was there no man when I came? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot pay for your life?

I make cloth made from hair its covering.\u201d", "4": "The Lord God has given Me the tongue of those who follow Him, that I may know how to give strength when I speak to one who is tired.

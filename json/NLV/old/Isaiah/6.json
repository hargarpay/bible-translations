{"1": "In the year of King Uzziah's death, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and honored. His long clothing spread out and filled the house of God. ", "2": "Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings. With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. ", "3": "One called out to another and said, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord of All. The whole earth is full of His shining-greatness.\u201d ", "4": "And the base of the doorways shook at the voice of him who called out, while the house of God was filled with smoke. ", "5": "Then I said, \u201cIt is bad for me, for I am destroyed! Because I am a man whose lips are unclean. And I live among a people whose lips are unclean. For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of All.\u201d", "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, with a burning coal which he had taken from the altar using a special tool. ", "7": "He touched my mouth with it, and said, \u201cSee, this has touched your lips, and your guilt is taken away. Your sin is forgiven.\u201d ", "8": "Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, \u201cWhom should I send? Who will go for Us?\u201d Then I said, \u201cHere am I. Send me!\u201d ", "9": "He said, \u201cGo, and tell these people, 'You hear and hear but do not understand. You look and look but do not see.' ", "10": "Make the hearts of these people hard. May their ears hear little and their eyes see little. Or they will see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts, and turn again and be healed.\u201d ", "11": "Then I said, \u201cLord, how long?\u201d And He answered, \u201cUntil cities are destroyed and empty, and until houses are without people and the land is laid waste. ", "12": "Until the Lord has taken men far away, and there are many places with no people in the land. ", "13": "Yet one tenth part of the people will stay in it. But it will be burned again, like an oak tree whose roots are still there when it is cut down. The holy seed is all that will be left (of Israel).\u201d"}

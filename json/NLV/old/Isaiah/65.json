I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' to a nation that did not call on My name. ", "2": "All day long I held out My hand to a people who would not obey Me and who worked against Me. They walk in a way that is not good, following their own thoughts. ", "3": "These people always make Me angry, giving gifts of worship in gardens and burning special perfume on altars of clay blocks. ", "4": "They sit among graves, and spend the night in secret places. They eat the flesh of pigs, and have boiled meat that is unclean in their pots. ", "5": "They say, 'Keep to yourself. Do not come near me. For I am holier than you.' These are smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day. ", "6": "See, it is written before Me: 'I will not keep quiet, but I will pay them back. I will pay them back into their breast, ", "7": "for both their own sins and the sins of their fathers,'\u201d says the Lord. \u201cBecause they have burned special perfume on the mountains and have spoken against Me on the hills, I will give them into their breasts the full pay for what they have done.\u201d", "8": "The Lord says, \u201cNew wine is found in the grapes, and one says, 'Do not destroy them, for there is still some good in them.'

All of you will bow down to be killed. Because when I called, you did not answer. I spoke, but you did not hear. You did what was sinful in My eyes, and chose what did not please Me.\u201d", "13": "So the Lord God says, \u201cSee, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry. See, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. See, My servants will be glad, but you will be put to shame. ", "14": "See, My servants will call out for joy with a glad heart.

{"1": "\u201cHear this, O family of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who come from the seed of Judah. They make promises in the name of the Lord, and call upon the God of Israel, but not in truth or by what is right and good. ", "2": "For they call themselves people of the holy city, and trust in the God of Israel. The Lord of All is His name. ", "3": "I made known the things that would happen long ago. From My mouth My words went out. Then all at once I did what I said I would, and they came to pass. ", "4": "I know that your heart is hard. Your neck is like iron, and your forehead is like brass. ", "5": "So I made them known to you long ago. I told you before they happened, or else you might say, 'My false god has done them. My objects of worship have made them happen.' ", "6": "You have heard, now look at all this. And will you say that you will not tell about it? I tell you new things from this time on, even hidden things which you have not known. ", "7": "They are made now, not long ago. Before today you have never heard of them, or you would say, 'See, I knew them.' ", "8": "You have not heard. You have not known. Even from long ago your ear has not been open, because I knew that you could not be trusted. You have been known to fight against the law and not obey from birth. ", "9": "Because of My name I hold back My anger. For My praise I keep Myself from cutting you off. ", "10": "See, I have tested you, but not as silver. I have tested you in the fire of suffering. ", "11": "For My own good, for My own good, I will do this. For why should I allow My name to be put to shame? I will not give My shining-greatness to another.", "12": "\u201cListen to Me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I called. I am He. I am the first, and I am the last. ", "13": "My hand put the earth in its place. And My right hand spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand together. ", "14": "Gather together, all of you, and listen! Who among them has made these things known? The Lord loves him. He will do to Babylon what pleases him, and his arm will be against the Babylonians. ", "15": "I, even I, have spoken. Yes, I have called him, I have brought him, and he will do well. ", "16": "Come near to Me and listen to this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret. From the time it came to be, I was there. And now the Lord God has sent me and His Spirit.\u201d", "17": "The Lord Who bought you and saves you, the Holy One of Israel, says, \u201cI am the Lord your God, Who teaches you to do well, Who leads you in the way you should go.

Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before Me.\u201d", "20": "Go out from Babylon! Run from the Babylonians! Call out for joy and let this be known to the end of the earth, saying, \u201cThe Lord has bought and set free His servant Jacob!\u201d ", "21": "They were not thirsty when He led them through the deserts. He made water flow out of the rock for them. He broke the rock, and the water flowed out. ", "22": "\u201cThere is no peace for the sinful,\u201d says the Lord."}

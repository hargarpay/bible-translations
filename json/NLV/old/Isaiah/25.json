{"1": "O Lord, You are my God. I will praise You. I will give thanks to Your name. For You have been faithful to do great things, plans that You made long ago. ", "2": "For You have laid waste a city. You have destroyed a strong city. The beautiful house of strangers is a city no more. And it will never be built again. ", "3": "So strong people will honor You. Cities of nations that show no pity will fear You. ", "4": "For You have been a strong-place for those who could not help themselves and for those in need because of much trouble. You have been a safe place from the storm and a shadow from the heat. For the breath of the one who shows no pity is like a storm against a wall. ", "5": "Like heat in a dry place, You quiet the noise of the strangers. Like heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the one who shows no pity is made quiet.", "6": "On this mountain the Lord of All will make a supper of good things ready for all people. It will be a supper of good wine, of the best foods, and of fine wine.

The Lord God will dry tears from all faces. He will take away the shame of His people from all the earth. For the Lord has spoken. ", "9": "It will be said in that day, \u201cSee, this is our God. We have waited for Him, that He might save us. This is the Lord for Whom we have waited. Let us be glad and full of joy because He saves us.\u201d", "10": "For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain. And Moab will be crushed in his place, as straw is crushed down in animal waste. ", "11": "Moab will spread out his hands in it, as a man spreads out his hands to swim. But the Lord will put his pride to shame, together with the sinful work of his hands. ", "12": "And the Lord will bring down your high walls built for war and lay them low. He will throw them to the ground, even to the dust."}

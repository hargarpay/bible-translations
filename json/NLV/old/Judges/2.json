I said, 'I will never break My agreement with you. ", "2": "Do not make any agreement with the people of this land. Tear down their altars.' But you have not obeyed Me. What is this you have done? ", "3": "So now I say, 'I will not drive them away from you. They will be like thorns in your sides. Their gods will be a trap to you.'\u201d ", "4": "When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people cried in a loud voice. ", "5": "So they called that place Bochim. And there they gave gifts in worship to the Lord.", "6": "When Joshua sent the people of Israel away, each one went home to his own land. ", "7": "The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the leaders who lived longer than Joshua and who had seen all the great works the Lord had done for Israel. ", "8": "Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was 110 years old. ", "9": "They buried him within his land in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. ", "10": "All the people of that day died. The children who came after them did not know the Lord. They did not know about the things He had done for Israel.", "11": "Then the people of Israel sinned in the eyes of the Lord. They served the Baals, the gods of the Canaanites. ", "12": "They turned away from the Lord, the God of their fathers, Who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods of the nations around them, and worshiped them. So they made the Lord angry. ", "13": "They turned away from the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. ", "14": "The Lord was angry with Israel. He gave them into the hands of angry men who robbed them. He sold them into the hands of those around them who hated them.

The people were very troubled.", "16": "Then the Lord gave them special men to judge between what was right or wrong. These men saved them from those who robbed them.

", "18": "When the Lord gave them special men to judge them, the Lord was with the judge. And He saved them from those who hated them. For the Lord showed them pity because of their pain when others made it hard for them and hurt them. ", "19": "But when the judge died, they would turn again and act worse than their fathers. They would follow other gods and serve them and worship them. They would not give up their sinful acts or their strong wills. ", "20": "So the anger of the Lord was against Israel. He said, \u201cThis nation has sinned against My agreement I made with their fathers. They have not listened to My voice. ", "21": "I will stop driving away from them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. ", "22": "I will use them to test Israel. I will see if Israel will keep the way of the Lord to walk in it like their fathers did, or not.\u201d ", "23": "So the Lord let those nations stay. He was not quick to drive them out. And He did not give them into the power of Joshua."}

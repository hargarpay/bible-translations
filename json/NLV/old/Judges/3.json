{"1": "These are the nations the Lord left to test Israel. They were left to test all those who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan. ", "2": "So the children of the people of Israel who had not fought in wars might be taught about war. ", "3": "These nations are: the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. ", "4": "They were left to test Israel, to find out if Israel would obey the Laws the Lord gave their fathers through Moses. ", "5": "The people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites. ", "6": "They married their daughters. They gave their own daughters to their sons, and they worshiped their gods. ", "7": "The people of Israel did what was sinful in the eyes of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. ", "8": "So the anger of the Lord was against Israel. He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. The people of Israel worked for Cushan-rishathaim for eight years. ", "9": "But the people of Israel cried to the Lord. And the Lord gave the people of Israel someone who would save them. He gave them Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. ", "10": "The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he led Israel. When he went out to war, the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. He was stronger than Cushan-rishathaim. ", "11": "The land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.", "12": "The people of Israel sinned in the eyes of the Lord again. So the Lord gave Eglon king of Moab strength against Israel, because they had sinned in the eyes of the Lord. ", "13": "Eglon gathered together with the people of Ammon and Amalek. They went and won the war against Israel. And they took the city of Jericho. ", "14": "The people of Israel worked for Eglon the king of Moab for eighteen years.", "15": "But when the people of Israel cried to the Lord, the Lord gave them someone to save them. He gave them Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent taxes by him to Eglon the king of Moab. ", "16": "Ehud made a sword for himself with two sharp sides, almost as long as an arm. He tied it to the top part of his right leg, under his coat. ", "17": "Then he brought the taxes to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. ", "18": "When Ehud had finished paying the taxes, he sent away the people who had carried the taxes. ", "19": "But he himself turned around at the stone gods of Gilgal and returned to Eglon, saying, \u201cI have secret news for you, O king.\u201d Eglon said, \u201cKeep quiet.\u201d And all who stood by him went away from him. ", "20": "Ehud came to him while Eglon was sitting alone in his summer room. And Ehud said, \u201cI have news from God for you.\u201d The king got up from his seat. ", "21": "Ehud put out his left hand, took the sword from his right leg, and pushed it into Eglon's stomach. ", "22": "The whole sword went into his stomach and the fat closed over it. For he did not pull the sword out of his stomach. The insides of Eglon's stomach ran out. ", "23": "Then Ehud went out the back way. He closed the doors of the summer room behind him, and locked them.", "24": "When Ehud had gone out, Eglon's servants came. They saw that the doors of the summer room were locked. So they said, \u201cHe is only resting in there away from the heat.\u201d ", "25": "They waited until they were afraid because Eglon did not open the doors of the summer room. So they opened the lock and looked in the doors. And they found their owner lying dead on the floor.", "26": "Ehud got away while they were waiting. He passed the stone gods and got away to Seirah. ", "27": "When he got there, he blew the horn in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country. Ehud went in front of them. ", "28": "He said to them, \u201cGo after them. For the Lord has given into your hands the Moabites who hate you.\u201d So they went down after him. They took over the crossing places of the Jordan beside Moab. And they did not let anyone cross. ", "29": "At that time they killed about 10,000 Moabites, all strong men with strength of heart. No one got away. ", "30": "So Moab was crushed under the power of Israel that day. And the land had rest for eighty years.", "31": "After Ehud, Shamgar the son of Anath became the leader. He killed 600 Philistines with a stick used to push cattle, and he also saved Israel."}

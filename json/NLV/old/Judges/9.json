Remember that I am your own bone and flesh.'\u201d ", "3": "So his mother's family spoke all these words for him in the ears of the leaders of Shechem. And they decided to follow Abimelech. For they said, \u201cHe is our brother.\u201d ", "4": "They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the family of Baal-berith. Abimelech used the money to hire wild men of no worth who followed him.

But Jerubbaal's youngest son Jotham was left alive, because he hid himself. ", "6": "Then all the men of Shechem and of Beth-millo gathered together. They went and made Abimelech king, by the tree that had been set up in Shechem.", "7": "When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim. He called out to them in a loud voice, \u201cListen to me, O men of Shechem. So God may listen to you. ", "8": "One time the trees went out to choose a king to rule them. They said to the olive tree, 'Rule over us!' ", "9": "But the olive tree said to them, 'Should I leave my riches of oil by which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?'

One group is coming on the way from the oak tree of those who tell the future.\u201d ", "38": "Then Zebul said to him, \u201cWhere is your proud talk now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Are these not the men whom you hated? Go out now and fight with them!\u201d ", "39": "So Gaal went out in front of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.

", "44": "Abimelech and the group with him rushed and stood in the city gate. The other two groups then rushed against all who were in the field and killed them. ", "45": "Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He took the city and killed the people who were in it. Then he destroyed the city and covered it with salt.", "46": "All the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard about it. And they went into the inside room of the house of the god of El-berith. ", "47": "Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. ", "48": "So Abimelech and all who were with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees. Then he lifted it onto his shoulder. He said to the men who were with him, \u201cHurry and do what you have seen me do.\u201d ", "49": "So each of the men cut down his branch also, and followed Abimelech. They put the branches around the inside room and set it on fire. So all the men of the tower of Shechem died. There were about 1,000 men and women in all.", "50": "Then Abimelech went to Thebez. He fought against it and took it. ", "51": "But there was a strong tower in the center of the city. All the men and women and leaders of the city ran to it and shut themselves in. And they went up on the roof of the tower. ", "52": "Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it. He went near the door of the building to burn it with fire. ", "53": "But a certain woman threw a grain-crushing stone on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull. ", "54": "Abimelech was quick to call the young man who carried his heavy battle-clothes, saying, \u201cTake your sword and kill me. Or else it will be said that a woman killed me.\u201d So the young man killed him with a sword. ", "55": "When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each man went home. ", "56": "So God punished Abimelech for the sin he had done against his father by killing his seventy brothers. ", "57": "God punished the men of Shechem for all their sin. The words that Jotham the son of Jerubbaal spoke against them came true."}

The Lord will break down their altars and destroy their pillars for worship.", "3": "Then they will say, \u201cWe have no king because we do not fear the Lord. And what could a king do for us?\u201d ", "4": "They speak empty words and make false promises, so punishment grows like weeds of poison in a plowed field. ", "5": "The people of Samaria will be afraid for the calf of Beth-aven. Its people will have sorrow for it. Its religious leaders who worship false gods will cry over it in a loud voice. They will cry because its greatness has gone. ", "6": "The thing itself will be carried to Assyria and given to King Jareb. Ephraim will be put to shame, and Israel will be ashamed of its false god.

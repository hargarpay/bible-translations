", "2": "Those who will not obey have gone deep into sin, but I will punish all of them. ", "3": "I know all about Ephraim. Israel is not hidden from Me. O Ephraim, you have acted like a woman who sells the use of her body. Israel has made itself unclean. ", "4": "Their wrong-doing will not allow them to return to their God. For a spirit of a woman who sells the use of her body is within them, and they do not know the Lord. ", "5": "The pride of Israel speaks against them. Israel and Ephraim fall in their sin, and Judah has fallen with them. ", "6": "They will go with their flocks and cattle to look for the Lord, but they will not find Him. He has gone away from them. ", "7": "They have not been faithful to the Lord, for they have given birth to children who are not His.

", "14": "For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the people of Judah. I will tear them to pieces and go away. I will carry them away, with no one to take them. ", "15": "I will go away and return to My place until they know they are guilty and look for Me. In their suffering they will try to find Me.\u201d"}

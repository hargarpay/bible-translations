The people will go out and gather a day's share every day, so I may test them to see if they will follow My Law or not. ", "5": "On the sixth day they are to bring in twice as much as they gather each day.\u201d ", "6": "So Moses and Aaron said to the people of Israel, \u201cThis evening you will know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt. ", "7": "And in the morning you will see the greatness of the Lord. For He hears your complaining against the Lord. What are we, that you complain against us?\u201d ", "8": "Moses said, \u201cThe Lord is giving you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning. For He hears how you complain against Him. What are we? You complain not against us, but against the Lord.\u201d ", "9": "Then Moses said to Aaron, \u201cSay to all the people of Israel, 'Come near to the Lord, for He has heard your complaining.'\u201d ", "10": "When Aaron spoke to all the people of Israel, they looked toward the desert.

", "15": "When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, \u201cIt is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat. ", "16": "This is what the Lord has told you to do: 'Every man gather as much of it as he can eat.

Make ready the food you will need for today. Then put aside what is left to be kept until morning.'\u201d ", "24": "So they put it aside until morning, as Moses told them. And it did not become bad to eat, and there were no worms in it. ", "25": "Moses said, \u201cEat it today. For today is a Day of Rest to the Lord. Today you will not find it in the field.

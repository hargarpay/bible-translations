I do not know the Lord. And I will not let Israel go.\u201d ", "3": "Then they said, \u201cThe God of the Hebrews has met with us. We ask of you, let us travel into the desert three days, to give a gift on an altar in worship to the Lord our God. Or He may send death to us by disease or by the sword.\u201d ", "4": "But the king of Egypt said to them, \u201cMoses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work?

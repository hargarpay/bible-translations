So you may know that I am the Lord.\u201d ", "3": "Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said to him, \u201cThe Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says this: 'How long will you hold your pride before Me? Let My people go, so they may worship Me. ", "4": "If you will not let My people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country. ", "5": "They will cover the land, so no one will be able to see the ground. They will eat what is left for you after the hail. They will eat every tree of yours that grows in the field. ", "6": "They will fill your houses, and the houses of your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians. Your fathers and your grandfathers have never seen such a thing from the day they were born until this day.'\u201d Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.", "7": "Pharaoh's servants said to him, \u201cHow long will this man bring trouble to us? Let the men go, so they may worship the Lord their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is destroyed?\u201d ", "8": "So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh.

But who will be going?\u201d ", "9": "Moses said, \u201cWe will go with our young and our old, our sons and our daughters, and our flocks and cattle. For we must make a special supper to the Lord.\u201d ", "10": "Then Pharaoh said to them, \u201cLet the Lord be with you if I ever let you go with your little ones! See, you have something bad in mind. ", "11": "No! You men go and worship the Lord. For that is what you want.\u201d And Moses and Aaron were sent away from Pharaoh.", "12": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cPut out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts to come upon the land of Egypt. They will eat every plant of the land, all that the hail has left.\u201d ", "13": "So Moses put out his special stick over the land of Egypt.

And there would never be so many again. ", "15": "For they covered the whole land and made it dark. They ate every plant of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt.", "16": "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in a hurry. He said, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord your God and against you. ", "17": "So now forgive my sin only this once. Pray to the Lord your God to take this death away from me.\u201d ", "18": "So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord. ", "19": "And the Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind. It lifted the locusts and sent them into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left in all the country of Egypt. ", "20": "But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard. He did not let the people of Israel go.", "21": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cPut out your hand toward the sky.

", "26": "So our animals will go with us also. Not a foot of an animal will be left behind. For we will take some of them to use as we worship the Lord our God. And until we are there, we do not know which ones we will use in worshiping the Lord.\u201d ", "27": "But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard. He was not willing to let them go.

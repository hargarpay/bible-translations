", "4": "I thought I should let you know about it. Buy it in front of those who are sitting here, and in front of the leaders of my people. If you will buy it, then buy it. But if not, tell me you do not want to buy it, so I may know. For you have the right to be the first one to buy it. And I am after you.\u201d The man said, \u201cI will buy it.\u201d ", "5": "Then Boaz said, \u201cThe day you buy the field from Naomi, you must take Ruth, the Moabite woman, also. She is the wife of the dead man. You must keep alive the name of the dead man on his land.\u201d ", "6": "Then the close in-law said, \u201cI cannot buy it for myself because it might be that my own children would not be able to own my land later. Take it for yourself. I give you my right to buy it, for I cannot buy it.\u201d", "7": "This is what was done before in Israel to show that the buying or trading of land was decided upon. A man would take off his shoe and give it to another. This would make sure what was decided. ", "8": "So he said to Boaz, \u201cBuy it for yourself.\u201d And he took off his shoe.

His name will not be forgotten among his brothers or from the gate of his birth-place. You have heard this today.\u201d ", "11": "All the people in the gate and the leaders said, \u201cWe have heard it. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you become rich in Ephrathah and be known by all in Bethlehem.

She became his wife, and he went in to her. The Lord made it possible for her to have a child and she gave birth to a son. ", "14": "The women said to Naomi, \u201cThanks be to the Lord. He has not left you without a family this day. May his name become known in all of Israel. ", "15": "May he bring you new life and strength while you are old. For your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.\u201d ", "16": "Then Naomi took the child and held him, and became his nurse.

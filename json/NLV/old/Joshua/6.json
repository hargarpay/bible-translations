Not a word should come from your mouth until the day I tell you to call out. Then you must call out.\u201d ", "11": "So he had the special box of the agreement taken around the city once.

Only Rahab, the woman who sells the use of her body, and all who are with her in the house will live, because she hid the men we sent. ", "18": "But keep yourselves from the things that are to be destroyed. Or while you give them up to be destroyed, you might desire them.

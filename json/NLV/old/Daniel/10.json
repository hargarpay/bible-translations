", "3": "I did not eat any fine food, and no meat or wine came into my mouth. And I did not use any oil at all, until the three weeks were finished.

Around him was a belt of fine gold. ", "6": "His body was like shining stone. His face looked like lightning. His eyes were like fire. His arms and feet were like shining brass. And his voice was like the noise of many people. ", "7": "I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the special dream. The men who were with me did not see it. But they were filled with much fear, and ran away to hide themselves. ", "8": "So I was left alone and saw this special dream. I had no strength left. My skin color turned white as if I were dead, and there was no strength left in me. ", "9": "Then I heard the sound of his words.

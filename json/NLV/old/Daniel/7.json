{"1": "In the first year that Belshazzar was king of Babylon, Daniel had a special dream in his mind as he lay on his bed. And he wrote the dream down, telling what he saw. ", "2": "Daniel said, \u201cIn my dream at night I looked and saw the four winds of heaven causing waves in the great sea. ", "3": "And four large animals were coming up from the sea, different from one another. ", "4": "The first was like a lion and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were pulled off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man. A man's heart was given to it also. ", "5": "Then I saw a second animal, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And it was told, 'Get up, and eat much meat!' ", "6": "Then I looked and saw another animal, which looked like a leopard. It had four wings of a bird on its back, and four heads. And it was given the power to rule. ", "7": "After this I looked in my dream in the night and saw a fourth animal. It filled me with a very great fear. It was very strong and it had large, iron teeth. It ate and crushed, and whatever was left, it crushed with its feet. It was different from all the animals that were before it, and it had ten horns. ", "8": "While I was thinking about the horns, I saw another horn, a little one, come up among them. And three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots in front of it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth which spoke in pride.", "9": "\u201cAs I kept looking, thrones were set up and the One Who has lived forever took His seat. His clothing was as white as snow and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne and its wheels were a burning fire. ", "10": "A river of fire was flowing and coming out from before Him. Many thousands were serving Him, and many millions were standing before Him. The Judge was seated, and The Books were opened. ", "11": "I kept looking because of the sound of the proud words which the horn was speaking. I watched until the fourth animal was killed, and its body was destroyed and thrown into the burning fire. ", "12": "The other three animals had their power taken away, but they were allowed to live for a time.", "13": "\u201cI kept looking in the night dream and saw One like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. He came to the One Who has lived forever, and was brought before Him. ", "14": "And He was given power and shining-greatness, and was made King, so that all the people of every nation and language would serve Him. His rule lasts forever. It will never pass away. And His nation will never be destroyed.", "15": "\u201cAs for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me. The things I saw in my dream made me afraid. ", "16": "I went to one of those who were standing near and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he told me what these things meant. ", "17": "'These four large animals are four kings who will rise from the earth. ", "18": "But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the nation and keep it forever and ever.' ", "19": "Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth animal which was different from all the others. It filled me with fear, with its iron teeth and sharp nails of brass. It ate and crushed, and whatever was left it crushed with its feet. ", "20": "I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and the other horn which came up. I wanted to know about the three horns that fell in front of this larger horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke proud words. ", "21": "As I watched, this horn was fighting a war against the holy ones and winning the battle, ", "22": "until the One came Who has lived forever. This One judged in favor of the holy ones of the Most High. And the time came when the holy ones took the nation for their own.", "23": "\u201cHe told me, 'The fourth animal will be a fourth nation on the earth. It will be different from all the other nations. It will destroy the whole earth. And it will crush under foot whatever is left. ", "24": "The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this nation. And another will come after them who will be different from the ones before. He will put three kings under his power. ", "25": "He will speak against the Most High and make it hard for His holy ones. And he will try to make changes in times and in law. The holy ones will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time (three and a half years). ", "26": "But the Judge will decide against him. And his ruling power will be taken away and destroyed forever. ", "27": "Then the ruling power and greatness of all the nations under the whole heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His nation will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.' ", "28": "This is the end of the special dream. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts filled me with fear and my face turned white. But I kept everything to myself.\u201d"}

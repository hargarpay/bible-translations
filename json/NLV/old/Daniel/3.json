{"1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made an object of gold which looked like a god. It was fifteen times taller than a man, and as wide as three long steps. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the land of Babylon. ", "2": "Then Nebuchadnezzar called together all the captains, leaders, rulers, wise men, money-keepers, judges, and law-keepers of Babylon's lands. He called them to come to the first showing of the object that he had set up. ", "3": "So all the captains, leaders, rulers, wise men, money-keepers, judges, and law-keepers of Babylon's lands were gathered together for the special time of setting apart this object Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood in front of it. ", "4": "Then the man who spread news for the king said in a loud voice, \u201cThis is what you must do, O people of every nation and language: ", "5": "When you hear the sound of the horns and harps, and all kinds of music, you are to get down on your knees and worship the object of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. ", "6": "Whoever does not get down and worship will be thrown at once into the big and hot fire.\u201d ", "7": "Then all the people heard the sound of the horns and harps and all kinds of music. All the people of every nation and language got down and worshiped the object of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.", "8": "At this time certain ones who learned from stars came up and spoke against the Jews. ", "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, \u201cO king, live forever! ", "10": "You yourself, O king, have made a law that every man who hears the sound of the horns and harps and all kinds of music is to get down on his knees and worship the object of gold. ", "11": "And whoever does not get down and worship must be thrown into the big and hot fire. ", "12": "There are certain Jews whom you have chosen as leaders over the land of Babylon. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. These men have not listened to you, O king. They do not serve your gods or worship the object of gold which you have set up.\u201d", "13": "Then Nebuchadnezzar became very angry and called for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. And they were brought to the king. ", "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \u201cIs it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the object of gold that I have set up? ", "15": "Now if you are ready to get down on your knees and worship the object I have made when you hear the sound of the horns and harps and all kinds of music, very well. But if you will not worship, you will be thrown at once into the fire. And what god is able to save you from my hands?\u201d ", "16": "Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, \u201cO Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer to this question. ", "17": "If we are thrown into the fire, our God Whom we serve is able to save us from it. And He will save us from your hand, O king. ", "18": "But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the object of gold that you have set up.\u201d", "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger, and he looked at Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego with an angry face. He had the fire made seven times hotter than it was. ", "20": "And he told certain powerful soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, and to throw them into the fire. ", "21": "So the men were tied up in their coats and head-coverings and their other clothes, and were thrown into the fire. ", "22": "Because the king had spoken that the fire was to be very hot, those men who put Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego into the fire were killed by the fire. ", "23": "The three men were still tied up when they fell into the fire.", "24": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar was very surprised and stood up in a hurry. He said to his leaders, \u201cDid we not throw three men who were tied up into the fire?\u201d They answered, \u201cThat is true, O king.\u201d ", "25": "He said, \u201cLook! I see four men loose and walking about in the fire without being hurt! And the fourth one looks like a son of the gods (or the Son of God)!\u201d", "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door where the fire was burning, and said, \u201cShadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!\u201d So Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the fire. ", "27": "The captains, leaders, rulers, and the king's important men gathered around and saw that the fire had not hurt the bodies of these three men. Their hair was not burned. Their clothes were not burned. They did not even smell like fire.", "28": "Nebuchadnezzar said, \u201cPraise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He has sent His angel and saved His servants who put their trust in Him. They changed the king's word and were ready to give up their lives instead of serving or worshiping any god except their own God. ", "29": "So I now make a law that if any people of any nation or language say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, they will be torn apart and their houses will be laid waste. For there is no other god who is able to save in this way.\u201d ", "30": "Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego very important in the land of Babylon."}

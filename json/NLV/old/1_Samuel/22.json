There were about 400 men with him.", "3": "David went from there to Mizpah of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, \u201cI beg of you, let my father and mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me.\u201d ", "4": "Then he left them with the king of Moab. They stayed with him all the time that David was in his safe place. ", "5": "The man who told what will happen in the future, Gad, said to David, \u201cDo not stay in this strong place. Leave, and go into the land of Judah.\u201d So David left and went among the trees of Hereth.", "6": "Now Saul heard that David and the men with him had been found. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand. All his servants were standing around him.

Will he make you all leaders of thousands and hundreds? ", "8": "For all of you have made plans against me. No one lets me know when my son makes an agreement with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or lets me know that my son has caused my servant to be against me and hide and wait, as it is this day.\u201d ", "9": "Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by Saul's servants, said, \u201cI saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

", "12": "Saul said, \u201cHear now, son of Ahitub.\u201d He answered, \u201cHere I am, my lord.\u201d ", "13": "Saul said to him, \u201cWhy have you and the son of Jesse planned against me? Why have you given him bread and a sword, and have asked the Lord what he should do, so he could rise against me and wait in hiding, as it is this day?\u201d ", "14": "Ahimelech answered the king, \u201cWho among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the king's son-in-law. He is captain of the soldiers who keep you safe, and is honored in your house. ", "15": "Is today the first time that I have asked things of God for him? No! Do not let the king do anything wrong to his servant or any of those of my father's family.

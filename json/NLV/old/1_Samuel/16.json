{"1": "The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cHow long will you be filled with sorrow because of Saul, since I have turned away from him being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse of Bethlehem. For I have chosen a king for Myself among his sons.\u201d ", "2": "But Samuel said, \u201cHow can I go? Saul will kill me when he hears about it.\u201d The Lord said, \u201cTake a young cow with you, and say, 'I have come to give a gift to the Lord.' ", "3": "Ask Jesse to come when you give the gift, and I will show you what you should do. You will choose for Me the one I name to you.\u201d ", "4": "So Samuel did what the Lord said, and came to Bethlehem. The leaders of the city came shaking with fear to meet him. They said, \u201cDo you come in peace?\u201d ", "5": "Samuel said, \u201cI have come in peace to give a gift to the Lord. Make yourselves holy and come with me as I give the gift.\u201d He set apart Jesse and his sons also, and asked them to come to the gift-giving. ", "6": "When they had come, Samuel looked at Eliab and thought, \u201cFor sure he is the Lord's chosen one who is standing before Him.\u201d ", "7": "But the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDo not look at the way he looks on the outside or how tall he is, because I have not chosen him. For the Lord does not look at the things man looks at. A man looks at the outside of a person, but the Lord looks at the heart.\u201d ", "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen this one.\u201d ", "9": "Next Jesse made Shammah pass by. But Samuel said, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen this one.\u201d ", "10": "Jesse made seven of his sons pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen these.\u201d ", "11": "Then Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cAre these all the children?\u201d And Jesse said, \u201cThere is yet the youngest one. See, he is taking care of the sheep.\u201d Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cSend for him. We will not sit down until he comes here.\u201d ", "12": "So he sent for him and brought him in. His youngest son had good color in his skin, beautiful eyes and was good-looking. The Lord said, \u201cRise up and choose him. For this is the one.\u201d ", "13": "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and poured the oil on him in front of his brothers. The Spirit of the Lord came upon David with strength from that day on. And Samuel got up and went to Ramah.", "14": "Now the Spirit of the Lord left Saul. And a bad spirit sent from the Lord brought trouble upon him. ", "15": "Saul's servants said to him, \u201cSee, a bad spirit from God is bringing you trouble. ", "16": "Let our lord now tell your servants who are in front of you to look for a man who is a good player of the harp. When the bad spirit sent from God is upon you, he will play the harp, and you will be well.\u201d ", "17": "So Saul said to his servants, \u201cFind me a man who can play well, and bring him to me.\u201d ", "18": "One of the young men said, \u201cI have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who plays music well. He is a man with strength of heart, a man of war, wise in his speaking, and good-looking. And the Lord is with him.\u201d ", "19": "So Saul sent men with news to Jesse, and said, \u201cSend me your son David who is with the sheep.\u201d ", "20": "Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them to Saul with David his son. ", "21": "David came to Saul and served him. Saul loved him very much, and he became the man who carried Saul's battle-clothes. ", "22": "Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, \u201cLet David serve me, for he has found favor in my eyes.\u201d ", "23": "When the bad spirit sent from God came upon Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand. And Saul would receive new strength and be well. The bad spirit would leave him."}

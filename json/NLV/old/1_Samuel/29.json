", "2": "The leaders of the Philistines were moving toward them with their hundreds and their thousands. And David and his men were moving behind them with Achish. ", "3": "Then the captains of the Philistines said, \u201cWhat are these Hebrews doing here?\u201d Achish said to the captains of the Philistines, \u201cIs this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years? I have found nothing wrong in him since the day he left to come to me.\u201d ", "4": "But the Philistine captains were angry with him. They said to him, \u201cMake the man return. Have him go again to his place which you have given him. Do not let him go down to battle with us. He might fight against us in the battle. For how could this man make his lord receive him again? Would it not be with the heads of these men?

But the captains of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go with us to the battle.' ", "10": "Now get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you. Leave as soon as you are up and have light.\u201d ", "11": "So David and his men left early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel."}

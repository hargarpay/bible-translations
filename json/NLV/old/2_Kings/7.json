", "4": "If we go into the city, there is no food there and we will die. And if we sit here, we will die also. So now come, let us go over to the tents of the Syrians. If they do not kill us, we will live. And if they kill us, we will die there.\u201d ", "5": "So they got up in the evening to go to the Syrians. When they came to the tents of the Syrians, there was no one there. ", "6": "For the Lord had made the Syrian army hear a sound of war-wagons and horses and an army of many soldiers.

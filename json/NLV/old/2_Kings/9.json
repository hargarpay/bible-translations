{"1": "Now Elisha the man of God called one of the sons of those who spoke for God. He said to him, \u201cGet ready to travel. Take this jar of oil and go to Ramoth-gilead. ", "2": "When you get there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi. Go in and have him come away from his brothers. Bring him into a room in the house. ", "3": "Then take the jar of oil and pour it on his head and say, 'The Lord says, \u201cI have chosen you to be the king of Israel.\u201d' Then open the door and run. Do not wait.\u201d ", "4": "So the young servant of the man of God went to Ramoth-gilead. ", "5": "When he came, he found the captains of the army sitting there. He said, \u201cI have something to tell you, O captain.\u201d And Jehu said, \u201cWhich one of us?\u201d And he said, \u201cYou, O captain.\u201d ", "6": "So he got up and went into the house. He poured the oil on Jehu's head and said to him, \u201cThe Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'I have chosen you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.

", "8": "The whole family of Ahab must be destroyed. And I will destroy every male person in Israel who belongs to Ahab, both the servants and those who are free.

No one will bury her.'\u201d Then he opened the door and ran away.", "11": "When Jehu came out to his owner's servants, one said to him, \u201cIs all well? Why did this crazy person come to you?\u201d Jehu said, \u201cYou know the man and his talk.\u201d ", "12": "And they said, \u201cThat is not true. Tell us now.\u201d Jehu said, \u201cThis is how he spoke to me. He said, 'The Lord says, \u201cI have chosen you to be the king of Israel.\u201d'\u201d ", "13": "Then each man took his clothes in a hurry and put them under him on the steps. And they sounded the horn and said, \u201cJehu is king!\u201d", "14": "So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi made plans against Joram. Now Joram and all Israel were fighting against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. ", "15": "But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the cuts the Syrians had given him, when he fought with King Hazael of Syria. So Jehu said, \u201cIf this is what you have in mind, then let no one get out of the city to tell the news in Jezreel.\u201d ", "16": "Then Jehu went to Jezreel in a war-wagon, for Joram was lying there. And Ahaziah the king of Judah had come down to see Joram.", "17": "Now the man who watched for danger was standing in the tower in Jezreel. He saw the group of Jehu's men coming, and said, \u201cI see a group of men coming.\u201d Joram said, \u201cSend a horseman to meet them and ask, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d ", "18": "So a horseman went to meet him and said, \u201cThe king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d And Jehu said, \u201cWhat have you to do with peace? Get behind me.\u201d Then the watchman told Joram, \u201cThe horseman came to them, but he did not return.\u201d ", "19": "So he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, \u201cThe king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d And Jehu answered, \u201cWhat have you to do with peace? Get behind me.\u201d ", "20": "The watchman told Joram, \u201cHe came to them, and he did not return. The leader goes in his war-wagon like a mad man, just like Jehu.\u201d", "21": "Then Joram said, \u201cGet ready.\u201d And they made his war-wagon ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in their war-wagon, to meet Jehu. They found him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. ", "22": "When Joram saw Jehu, he said, \u201cDo you come in peace, Jehu?\u201d And he answered, \u201cWhat peace can there be, so long as the sinful ways and witchcrafts of your mother Jezebel are so many?\u201d ", "23": "So Joram turned the horses around and ran away, saying to Ahaziah, \u201cHe is turning against the king, O Ahaziah!\u201d ", "24": "Jehu pulled his bow with all his strength and shot Joram between his arms. The arrow went through his heart, and he fell in his war-wagon. ", "25": "Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, \u201cPick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For I remember when you and I were going together after his father Ahab. The Lord said then that this would happen to him. ", "26": "The Lord said, 'Yesterday I have seen the blood of Naboth and his sons. I will punish you in this field.' So now take and throw him into the field, as the word of the Lord has said.\u201d", "27": "When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he ran away toward the garden house. Jehu went after him and said, \u201cShoot him in the war-wagon also.\u201d So they shot him at the hill of Gur, by Ibleam. But he got away to Megiddo and died there.

Who?\u201d And two or three men looked down at him. ", "33": "Then he said, \u201cThrow her down.\u201d So they threw Jezebel down. Some of her blood went on the wall and on the horses. And Jehu made his war-wagons go over her. ", "34": "Then Jehu went in and ate and drank. And he said, \u201cNow go out to this sinful woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.\u201d ", "35": "So they went to bury her. But all they found were her skull and feet and hands. ", "36": "When they returned and told Jehu, he said, \u201cThis is the word of the Lord, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite.

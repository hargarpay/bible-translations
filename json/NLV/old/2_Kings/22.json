He did not turn aside to the right or to the left.", "3": "In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the writer, the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, to the house of the Lord. He said, ", "4": "\u201cGo up to Hilkiah the head religious leader, that he may add up the money brought into the Lord's house which the door-keepers have gathered from the people. ", "5": "Let the money be given to the workmen who are watching over the work on the Lord's house. And let them give it to the workmen who are doing the work on the Lord's house. ", "6": "Have them pay the builders and the men who work with wood and with stone. Have them use it for buying wood and cut stone needed to work on the house. ", "7": "But do not make them tell you how the money was spent that was given to them. For they are honest men.\u201d", "8": "Then Hilkiah the head religious leader said to Shaphan the writer, \u201cI have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.\u201d And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

For the Lord is very angry with us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book.

For the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.\u201d So they went down to Bethel. ", "3": "Then the sons of the men who spoke for God at Bethel came out to Elisha. They said to him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord will take Elijah from you today?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, I know. Say no more.\u201d ", "4": "Elijah said to him, \u201cElisha, I ask you to stay here. For the Lord has sent me to Jericho.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.\u201d So they came to Jericho. ", "5": "The sons of the men who spoke for God at Jericho came to Elisha. They said to him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord will take Elijah from you today?\u201d And he answered, \u201cYes, I know. Say no more.\u201d ", "6": "Then Elijah said to him, \u201cI ask you to stay here. For the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.\u201d And Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.\u201d So the two of them went on.", "7": "Now fifty sons of the men who tell what will happen in the future went and stood on the other side of the Jordan River a long way off from the two of them who were standing by the Jordan.

But if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be given to you. But if not, it will not be so.\u201d ", "11": "As they went on and talked, a war-wagon of fire and horses of fire came between them. And Elijah went up by a wind-storm to heaven. ", "12": "Elisha saw it and cried out, \u201cMy father, my father, the war-wagon of Israel and its horsemen!\u201d And he saw Elijah no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. ", "13": "He picked up Elijah's coat that had fallen from him. And he returned and stood by the side of the Jordan. ", "14": "He took Elijah's coat that fell from him, and hit the water and said, \u201cWhere is the Lord, the God of Elijah?\u201d When he hit the water, it was divided to one side and to the other, and Elisha crossed the Jordan.", "15": "The sons of the men who tell what will happen in the future at Jericho saw him. And they said, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.\u201d They came to meet him and bowed to the ground in front of him. ", "16": "They said to him, \u201cNow see, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Let them go and look for your teacher. It might be that the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or into some valley.\u201d And Elisha said, \u201cDo not send them.\u201d ", "17": "But they talked to him until he was ashamed, and he said, \u201cSend them.\u201d So they sent fifty men to look for Elijah.

It will not cause death or loss of fruit any more.'\u201d ", "22": "So the water has been pure to this day, just as Elisha said.", "23": "Then he left there and went to Bethel. On the way, some young boys came out from the city and made fun of him. They said to him, \u201cGo up, you man with no hair! Go up, you man with no hair!\u201d ", "24": "He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two female bears came from among the trees and tore up forty-two of the boys. ", "25": "Elisha went from there to Mount Carmel, then returned to Samaria."}

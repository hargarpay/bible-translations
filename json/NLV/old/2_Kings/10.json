So your sons, even your great great grandson, will sit on the throne of Israel.\u201d ", "31": "But Jehu was not careful to walk in the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel sin.", "32": "In those days the Lord began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael won over them in battle through the land of Israel.

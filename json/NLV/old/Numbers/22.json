See, they cover the land, and they are living beside me. ", "6": "Now come, I beg you. Curse this people for me, because they are too strong for me. Then I may be able to win the battle against them and send them out of the land. For I know that good will come to the one you pray for, and trouble will come to the one you curse.\u201d", "7": "So the leaders of Moab and the leaders of Midian left with the pay in their hand for the one who tells what will happen in the future.

Now come, curse them for me. Then I may be able to fight against them and send them away.'\u201d ", "12": "God said to Balaam, \u201cDo not go with them. Do not curse the people, for I have decided that good would come to them.\u201d ", "13": "So Balaam got up in the morning and said to Balak's leaders, \u201cReturn to your land. For the Lord will not let me go with you.\u201d ", "14": "So the leaders of Moab got up and went to Balak, and said, \u201cBalaam would not come with us.\u201d", "15": "Balak sent leaders again, more than were sent before, and men who were more important.

He stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or the left. ", "27": "When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam. So Balaam was angry and hit the donkey with his stick. ", "28": "And the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, \u201cWhat have I done to you? Why have you hit me these three times?\u201d ", "29": "Balaam said to the donkey, \u201cBecause you have made a fool of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now!\u201d ", "30": "The donkey said to Balaam, \u201cAm I not your donkey on which you have traveled all your life to this day? Have I ever done this to you before?\u201d And Balaam said, \u201cNo.\u201d", "31": "Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way with his sword in his hand.

If she had not turned from me, for sure I would have killed you, and let her live.\u201d ", "34": "Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, \u201cI have sinned. For I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. But now, if it does not please you, I will turn back.\u201d ", "35": "The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, \u201cGo with the men. But speak only what I tell you.\u201d So Balaam went with the leaders of Balak.", "36": "Balak heard that Balaam was coming. He went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the Arnon, at the far side of the country. ", "37": "Balak said to Balaam, \u201cDid I not send men to tell you to come? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?\u201d ", "38": "Balaam said to Balak, \u201cSee, I have come to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The Word that God puts in my mouth is what I must speak.\u201d ", "39": "Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriathhuzoth.

Balak and Balaam gave a bull and a ram on each altar in worship. ", "3": "Then Balaam said to Balak, \u201cStand beside your burnt gift, and I will go. It might be that the Lord will come to me. And whatever He shows me I will tell you.\u201d So he went up to a hill without trees. ", "4": "God met Balaam. Balaam said to Him, \u201cI have made seven altars. And I have given a bull and a ram on each altar in worship.\u201d ", "5": "Then the Lord put words in Balaam's mouth, and said, \u201cReturn to Balak. This is what you should say.\u201d ", "6": "So Balaam returned to Balak, and saw him and all the leaders of Moab standing beside his burnt gift. ", "7": "Balaam began speaking and said, \u201cBalak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east. 'Come, curse Jacob for me,' he said. 'Come, say that Israel should be punished!' ", "8": "How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I say that those should be punished whom God has not said should be punished?

Let my end be like theirs!\u201d", "11": "Balak said to Balaam, \u201cWhat have you done to me? I took you to curse those who hate me.

But you will only see a part of them and not all of them. Curse them for me from there.\u201d ", "14": "So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah. He built seven altars and gave a bull and a ram on each altar.

This is what you should say.\u201d ", "17": "So he returned to Balak, and saw him and all the leaders of Moab standing beside his burnt gift. Balak said to him, \u201cWhat has the Lord said?\u201d ", "18": "Then Balaam began speaking and said, \u201cRise, O Balak, and hear! Listen to me, O son of Zippor! ", "19": "God is not a man, that He should lie. He is not a son of man, that He should be sorry for what He has said. Has He said, and will He not do it? Has He spoken, and will He not keep His Word?

It will not lie down until it eats the food it has killed, and drinks the blood of the kill.\u201d ", "25": "Balak said to Balaam, \u201cDo not curse them at all or pray that good would come to them!\u201d ", "26": "But Balaam answered Balak, \u201cDid I not tell you that I must do whatever the Lord says?\u201d", "27": "Then Balak said to Balaam, \u201cI beg you, come. I will take you to another place. It might be that God will be pleased to have you curse them for me from there.\u201d ", "28": "So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which looks over the desert. ", "29": "Balaam said to Balak, \u201cBuild seven altars for me here. And make ready seven bulls and seven rams for me here.\u201d ", "30": "Balak did just as Balaam had said. He gave a bull and a ram on each altar in worship."}

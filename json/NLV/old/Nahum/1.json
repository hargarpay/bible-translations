{"1": "This is the word about Nineveh, the book of the special dream of Nahum the Elkoshite.", "2": "The Lord is a jealous God and One Who punishes. The Lord punishes and is angry. The Lord punishes those who fight against Him. He is angry with those who hate Him. ", "3": "The Lord is slow to anger and great in power. The Lord will be sure to punish the guilty. The way He punishes is in the strong-wind and storm. The clouds are the dust under His feet. ", "4": "He speaks sharp words to the sea and makes it dry. He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel dry up. The flowers of Lebanon dry up. ", "5": "Mountains shake because of Him, and the hills melt. The earth is laid waste before Him, the world and everyone in it. ", "6": "Who can stand before His anger? Who can live through the burning of His anger? His anger is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken up by Him. ", "7": "The Lord is good, a safe place in times of trouble. And He knows those who come to Him to be safe. ", "8": "But He will put an end to Nineveh by making a flood flow over it. And He will drive those who hate Him into darkness.", "9": "Whatever plan you make against the Lord, He will destroy it. Trouble will not come a second time.

I will destroy the false gods and objects of worship from the house of your gods. I will make your grave ready, for you are very sinful.\u201d", "15": "See, on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news and speaks of peace! Keep your special suppers, O Judah. Keep your promises. For the sinful one will never come against you again. He is destroyed."}

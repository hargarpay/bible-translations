", "2": "For the Lord will make Jacob great again, like the greatness of Israel, even when destroyers have destroyed them and their vine branches.", "3": "The battle-coverings of his strong men are red. His men of war are dressed in red. The war-wagons shine like fire when they are made ready. The cypress spears are waved. ", "4": "The war-wagons race in the streets. They rush through the city. They look like fire and move like lightning. ", "5": "The leaders are called. They lose their step as they go, and hurry to the wall. The battle-covering is set up.

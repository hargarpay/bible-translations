", "3": "If one wished to argue with Him, he would not be able to answer one out of a thousand of His questions. ", "4": "He is wise in heart and powerful in strength. Who has ever stood against Him without being hurt? ", "5": "It is He Who takes away the mountains without their knowing it, when He destroys them in His anger. ", "6": "He shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars shake. ", "7": "He tells the sun not to shine, and He keeps the stars from shining. ", "8": "He alone spreads out the heavens and walks upon the waves of the sea. ", "9": "He makes the Bear, Orion and the Pleiades and the stars of the south.

If it is a question of what is right and fair, who can call Him to a trial? ", "20": "Even if I were right, my mouth would say that I am guilty. Even if I were without blame, He would say I am guilty. ", "21": "Even though I am without blame, I do not care about myself. I hate my life.

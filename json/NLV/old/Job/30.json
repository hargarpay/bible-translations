{"1": "\u201cBut now those who are younger than I make fun of me. I thought so little of their fathers that I did not want them with my sheep dogs. ", "2": "Yes, what good could I get from the strength of their hands? Their strength was gone. ", "3": "Their bodies are thin and in need of food. At night they bite the dry ground in the waste land. ", "4": "They pick plants that taste of salt among the bushes. And they eat the root of the broom bush. ", "5": "They are driven away from people. Men call out against them as if they were robbers. ", "6": "So they live in valleys made by floods, in caves of the earth and of the rocks. ", "7": "Among the bushes they cry out. They gather together under the thistles. ", "8": "They are fools and they have no name. They have been driven out of the land.", "9": "\u201cNow they make fun of me in song. They laugh at me. ", "10": "They hate me and keep away from me, but they spit in my face. ", "11": "Because God has made the string of my bow loose and has troubled me, they have thrown off their respect for me. ", "12": "Their bad group comes to my right. They push me away and trip my feet, and make ways to destroy me. ", "13": "They break up my path. They make trouble for me, and no one stops them. ", "14": "They come as if through a wide hole in the wall, and roll on with much noise. ", "15": "Fears come upon me. They go after my honor like the wind. And my well-being has passed away like a cloud.", "16": "\u201cNow my soul is poured out within me. Days of trouble have taken hold of me. ", "17": "Night cuts into my bones with pain. The pain keeps on and takes no rest. ", "18": "My clothing is torn by a strong power. It pulls against me like the top of my coat. ", "19": "God has thrown me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes. ", "20": "I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me. I stand up, and You turn away from me. ", "21": "You work against me. With the power of Your hand you make it hard for me. ", "22": "You lift me up to the wind and make it carry me. You throw me around in the storm. ", "23": "For I know that You will bring me to death, to the place for all the living.", "24": "\u201cYet does not one in a destroyed place put out his hand, and in his trouble cry out for help? ", "25": "Have I not cried for the one whose life is hard? Was not my soul filled with sorrow for the poor? ", "26": "When I expected good, then trouble came. When I waited for light, darkness came. ", "27": "My heart is troubled and does not rest. Days of trouble are before me. ", "28": "I go about full of sorrow without comfort. I stand up where the people are gathered and cry out for help. ", "29": "I have become a brother to wild dogs, and a friend of ostriches. ", "30": "My skin becomes black and falls from me. My bones burn because I am sick. ", "31": "So my harp is turned to sorrow, and my horn to the sound of crying."}

{"1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was without blame. He was right and good, he feared God, and turned away from sin. ", "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. ", "3": "He had 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 oxen, 500 female donkeys, and many servants. He was the greatest of all the men of the east. ", "4": "His sons used to go and make a special supper in each one's house on a special day. And they would send for their three sisters to eat and drink with them. ", "5": "When the days of their special supper were over, Job would get up early in the morning and send for them. Then he would give burnt gifts for each of them so that they would be pure. For Job said, \u201cIt might be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.\u201d Job always did this.", "6": "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to show themselves before the Lord. Satan came with them also. ", "7": "And the Lord said to Satan, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d Satan answered the Lord and said, \u201cFrom traveling around on the earth and walking around on it.\u201d ", "8": "The Lord said to Satan, \u201cHave you thought about My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth. He is without blame, a man who is right and good. He honors God with fear and turns away from sin.\u201d ", "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, \u201cDoes Job fear God for nothing? ", "10": "Have You not made a wall around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have brought good to the work of his hands, and he has received more and more in the land. ", "11": "But put out Your hand now and touch all that he has. And for sure he will curse You to Your face.\u201d ", "12": "Then the Lord said to Satan, \u201cSee, all that he has is in your power. Only do not put your hand on him.\u201d So Satan went out from the Lord.", "13": "On a day when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, ", "14": "a man came to Job with news, saying, \u201cThe oxen were pulling the plow and the donkeys were eating beside them. ", "15": "And the Sabeans came and took them. They also killed the servants with the sword. I alone have run away from them to tell you.\u201d ", "16": "While he was still speaking, another man came and said, \u201cThe fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and destroyed them. I alone have gotten away to tell you.\u201d ", "17": "While he was still speaking, another came and said, \u201cThe Babylonians divided into three groups and came to fight. They took the camels and killed the servants with the sword. I alone have gotten away to tell you.\u201d ", "18": "While he was still speaking, another also came and said, \u201cYour sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house. ", "19": "And see, a strong wind came from the desert and hit the four corners of the house. It fell on the young people and they are dead. I alone have gotten away to tell you.\u201d", "20": "Then Job stood up and tore his clothing and cut the hair from his head. And he fell to the ground and worshiped. ", "21": "He said, \u201cWithout clothing I was born from my mother, and without clothing I will return. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Praise the name of the Lord.\u201d ", "22": "In all this Job did not sin or blame God."}

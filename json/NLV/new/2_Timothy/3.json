They will speak against God. Children and young people will not obey their parents. People will not be thankful and they will not be holy. ", "3": "They will not love each other. No one can get along with them. They will tell lies about others. They will not be able to keep from doing things they know they should not do. They will be wild and want to beat and hurt those who are good. ", "4": "They will not stay true to their friends. They will act without thinking. They will think too much of themselves. They will love fun instead of loving God. ", "5": "They will do things to make it look as if they are Christians. But they will not receive the power that is for a Christian. Keep away from such people.", "6": "These are the kind of people who go from house to house. They talk to foolish women who are loaded down with sins and all kinds of sinful desires. ", "7": "Such women are always listening to new teaching. But they are never able to understand the truth. ", "8": "Jannes and Jambres fought against Moses.

They will lead others the wrong way and will be led the wrong way themselves.", "14": "But as for you, hold on to what you have learned and know to be true. Remember where you learned them. ", "15": "You have known the Holy Writings since you were a child. They are able to give you wisdom that leads to being saved from the punishment of sin by putting your trust in Christ Jesus. ", "16": "All the Holy Writings are God-given and are made alive by Him. Man is helped when he is taught God's Word. It shows what is wrong. It changes the way of a man's life. It shows him how to be right with God. ", "17": "It gives the man who belongs to God everything he needs to work well for Him."}

The head religious leader said, ", "28": "\u201cWe told you not to teach about Christ! See! You are spreading this teaching over all Jerusalem. Now you are making it look as if we are guilty of killing this Man.\u201d", "29": "Then Peter and the missionaries said, \u201cWe must obey God instead of men! ", "30": "The God of our early fathers raised up Jesus, the One you killed and nailed to a cross. ", "31": "God raised this Man to His own right side as a leader and as the One Who saves from the punishment of sin. He makes it possible for the Jews to be sorry for their sins.

{"1": "Our body is like a house we live in here on earth. When it is destroyed, we know that God has another body for us in heaven. The new one will not be made by human hands as a house is made. This body will last forever. ", "2": "Right now we cry inside ourselves because we wish we could have our new body which we will have in heaven. ", "3": "We will not be without a body. We will live in a new body. ", "4": "While we are in this body, we cry inside ourselves because things are hard for us. It is not that we want to die. Instead, we want to live in our new bodies. We want this dying body to be changed into a living body that lasts forever. ", "5": "It is God Who has made us ready for this change. He has given us His Spirit to show us what He has for us.", "6": "We are sure of this. We know that while we are at home in this body we are not with the Lord. ", "7": "Our life is lived by faith. We do not live by what we see in front of us. ", "8": "We are sure we will be glad to be free of these bodies. It will be good to be at home with the Lord. ", "9": "So if we stay here on earth or go home to Him, we always want to please Him. ", "10": "For all of us must stand before Christ when He says who is guilty or not guilty. Each one will receive pay for what he has done. He will be paid for the good or the bad done while he lived in this body.", "11": "Because of this, we know the fear of God. So we try to get men to put their trust in Christ. God knows us. I hope that your hearts know me well also. ", "12": "We do not want to sound as if we think we are so important. Instead, we are making it easy for you to be proud of us. In that way, you will be able to tell them about us. They always talk about the way people look, but do not care about their hearts. ", "13": "Are we crazy to talk like this? It is all because of what God has done. If we are using our minds well, it is for you. ", "14": "For the love of Christ puts us into action. We are sure that Christ died for everyone. So, because of that, everyone has a part in His death. ", "15": "Christ died for everyone so that they would live for Him. They should not live to please themselves but for Christ Who died on a cross and was raised from the dead for them.", "16": "So from now on, we do not think about what people are like by looking at them. We even thought about Christ that way one time. But we do not think of Him that way anymore. ", "17": "For if a man belongs to Christ, he is a new person. The old life is gone. New life has begun. ", "18": "All this comes from God. He is the One Who brought us to Himself when we hated Him. He did this through Christ. Then He gave us the work of bringing others to Him. ", "19": "God was in Christ. He was working through Christ to bring the whole world back to Himself. God no longer held men's sins against them. And He gave us the work of telling and showing men this. ", "20": "We are Christ's missionaries. God is speaking to you through us. We are speaking for Christ and we ask you from our hearts to turn from your sins and come to God. ", "21": "Christ never sinned but God put our sin on Him. Then we are made right with God because of what Christ has done for us."}

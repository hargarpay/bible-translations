{"1": "Are we making it sound as if we think we are so important? Other people write letters about themselves. Do we need to write such a letter to you? ", "2": "You are our letter. You are written in our hearts. You are known and read by all men. ", "3": "You are as a letter from Christ written by us. You are not written as other letters are written with ink, or on pieces of stone. You are written in human hearts by the Spirit of the living God. ", "4": "We can say these things because of our faith in God through Christ. ", "5": "We know we are not able in ourselves to do any of this work. God makes us able to do these things. ", "6": "God is the One Who made us preachers of a New Way of Worship. This New Way of Worship is not of the Law. It is of the Holy Spirit. The Law brings death, but the Holy Spirit gives life.", "7": "The Law of Moses was written on stone and it brought death. But God's shining-greatness was seen when it was given. When Moses took it to the Jews, they could not look at his face because of the bright light. But that bright light in his face began to pass away. ", "8": "The new way of life through the Holy Spirit comes with much more shining-greatness. ", "9": "If the Law of Moses, that leads to death, came in shining-greatness, how much greater and brighter is the light that makes us right with God? ", "10": "The Law of Moses came with shining-greatness long ago. But that light is no longer bright. The shining-greatness of the New Way of Worship that brings us life is so much brighter. ", "11": "The shining light that came with the Law of Moses soon passed away. But the new way of life is much brighter. It will never pass away.", "12": "We speak without fear because our trust is in Christ. ", "13": "We are not like Moses. He put a covering over his face so the Jews would not see that the bright light was passing away. ", "14": "Their minds were not able to understand. Even to this day when the Law is read, there is a covering over their minds. They do not see that Christ is the only One Who can take the covering away. ", "15": "Yes, to this day, there is a covering over their hearts whenever the Law of Moses is read. ", "16": "But whenever a man turns to the Lord, the covering is taken away. ", "17": "The heart is free where the Spirit of the Lord is. The Lord is the Spirit. ", "18": "All of us, with no covering on our faces, show the shining-greatness of the Lord as in a mirror. All the time we are being changed to look like Him, with more and more of His shining-greatness. This change is from the Lord Who is the Spirit."}

If anyone does not make a mistake with his tongue by saying the wrong things, he is a perfect man. It shows he is able to make his body do what he wants it to do. ", "3": "We make a horse go wherever we want it to go by a small bit in its mouth. We turn its whole body by this. ", "4": "Sailing ships are driven by strong winds. But a small rudder turns a large ship whatever way the man at the wheel wants the ship to go.", "5": "The tongue is also a small part of the body, but it can speak big things. See how a very small fire can set many trees on fire. ", "6": "The tongue is a fire. It is full of wrong. It poisons the whole body. The tongue sets our whole lives on fire with a fire that comes from hell. ", "7": "Men can make all kinds of animals and birds and fish and snakes do what they want them to do. ", "8": "But no man can make his tongue say what he wants it to say. It is sinful and does not rest. It is full of poison that kills. ", "9": "With our tongue we give thanks to our Father in heaven.

Then it gives peace. It is gentle and willing to obey. It is full of loving-kindness and of doing good. It has no doubts and does not pretend to be something it is not. ", "18": "Those who plant seeds of peace will gather what is right and good."}

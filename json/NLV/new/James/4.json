{"1": "What starts wars and fights among you? Is it not because you want many things and are fighting to have them? ", "2": "You want something you do not have, so you kill. You want something but cannot get it, so you fight for it. You do not get things because you do not ask for them. ", "3": "Or if you do ask, you do not receive because your reasons for asking are wrong. You want these things only to please yourselves.", "4": "You are as wives and husbands who are not faithful in marriage and do sex sins. Do you not know that to love the sinful things of the world and to be a friend to them is to be against God? Yes, I say it again, if you are a friend of the world, you are against God. ", "5": "Do you think the Holy Writings mean nothing when they said, \u201cThe Holy Spirit Whom God has given to live in us has a strong desire for us to be faithful to Him\u201d?", "6": "But He gives us more loving-favor. For the Holy Writings say, \u201cGod works against the proud but gives loving-favor to those who have no pride.\u201d  ", "7": "So give yourselves to God. Stand against the devil and he will run away from you. ", "8": "Come close to God and He will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners. Clean up your hearts, you who want to follow the sinful ways of the world and God at the same time. ", "9": "Be sorry for your sins and cry because of them. Be sad and do not laugh. Let your joy be turned to sorrow. ", "10": "Let yourself be brought low before the Lord. Then He will lift you up and help you.", "11": "Christian brothers, do not talk against anyone or speak bad things about each other. If a person says bad things about his brother, he is speaking against him. And he will be speaking against God's Law. If you say the Law is wrong, and do not obey it, you are saying you are better than the Law. ", "12": "Only God can say what is right or wrong. He made the Law. He can save or put to death. How can we say if our brother is right or wrong?", "13": "Listen! You who say, \u201cToday or tomorrow we will go to this city and stay a year and make money.\u201d ", "14": "You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life? It is like fog. You see it and soon it is gone. ", "15": "What you should say is, \u201cIf the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or that.\u201d ", "16": "But instead you are proud. You talk loud and big about yourselves. All such pride is sin. ", "17": "If you know what is right to do but you do not do it, you sin."}

{"1": "Do as God would do. Much-loved children want to do as their fathers do. ", "2": "Live with love as Christ loved you. He gave Himself for us, a gift on the altar to God which was as a sweet smell to God.", "3": "Do not let sex sins or anything sinful be even talked about among those who belong to Christ. Do not always want everything. ", "4": "Do not be guilty of telling bad stories and of foolish talk. These things are not for you to do. Instead, you are to give thanks for what God has done for you. ", "5": "Be sure of this! No person who does sex sins or who is not pure will have any part in the holy nation of Christ and of God. The same is true for the person who always wants what other people have. This becomes a god to him. ", "6": "Do not let anyone lead you in the wrong way with foolish talk. The anger of God comes on such people because they choose to not obey Him. ", "7": "Have nothing to do with them. ", "8": "At one time you lived in darkness. Now you are living in the light that comes from the Lord. Live as children who have the light of the Lord in them. ", "9": "This light gives us truth. It makes us right with God and makes us good. ", "10": "Learn how to please the Lord. ", "11": "Have nothing to do with the bad things done in darkness. Instead, show that these things are wrong. ", "12": "It is a shame even to talk about these things done in secret. ", "13": "All things can be seen when they are in the light. Everything that can be seen is in the light. ", "14": "The Holy Writings say, \u201cWake up, you who are sleeping. Rise from the dead and Christ will give you light.\u201d ", "15": "So be careful how you live. Live as men who are wise and not foolish. ", "16": "Make the best use of your time. These are sinful days. ", "17": "Do not be foolish. Understand what the Lord wants you to do. ", "18": "Do not get drunk with wine. That leads to wild living. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit. ", "19": "Tell of your joy to each other by singing the Songs of David and church songs. Sing in your heart to the Lord. ", "20": "Always give thanks for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.", "21": "Be willing to help and care for each other because of Christ. By doing this, you honor Christ. ", "22": "Wives, obey your own husbands. In doing this, you obey the Lord. ", "23": "For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is His body (the church) that He saves. ", "24": "As the church is to obey Christ, wives are to obey their own husbands in everything.", "25": "Husbands, love your wives. You must love them as Christ loved the church. He gave His life for it. ", "26": "Christ did this so He could set the church apart for Himself. He made it clean by the washing of water with the Word. ", "27": "Christ did this so the church might stand before Him in shining-greatness. There is to be no sin of any kind in it. It is to be holy and without blame. ", "28": "So men should love their wives as they love their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. ", "29": "No man hates himself. He takes care of his own body. That is the way Christ does. He cares for His body which is the church. ", "30": "We are all a part of His body, the church. ", "31": "For this reason, a man must leave his father and mother when he gets married and be joined to his wife. The two become one. ", "32": "This is hard to understand, but it shows that the church is the body of Christ. ", "33": "So every man must love his wife as he loves himself. Every wife must respect her husband."}

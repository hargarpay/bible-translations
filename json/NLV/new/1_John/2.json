{"1": "My dear children, I am writing this to you so you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, there is One Who will go between him and the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the One Who is right with God. ", "2": "He paid for our sins with His own blood. He did not pay for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.", "3": "We can be sure that we know Him if we obey His teaching. ", "4": "Anyone who says, \u201cI know Him,\u201d but does not obey His teaching is a liar. There is no truth in him. ", "5": "But whoever obeys His Word has the love of God made perfect in him. This is the way to know if you belong to Christ. ", "6": "The one who says he belongs to Christ should live the same kind of life Christ lived.", "7": "Dear friends, I am not writing a new Law for you to obey. It is an old Law you have had from the beginning. The old Law is the Word that you have heard. ", "8": "And yet it is a new Law that I am writing to you. It is truth. It was seen in Christ and it is seen in you also. The darkness is passing away and the true Light shines instead. ", "9": "Whoever says he is in the light but hates his brother is still in darkness.

I have written to you, young men, because you are strong. You have kept God's Word in your hearts. You have power over the devil.", "15": "Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not in him. ", "16": "For everything that is in the world does not come from the Father. The desires of our flesh and the things our eyes see and want and the pride of this life come from the world. ", "17": "The world and all its desires will pass away. But the man who obeys God and does what He wants done will live forever.", "18": "My children, we are near the end of the world. You have heard that the false-christ is coming. Many false-christs have already come. This is how we know the end of the world is near. ", "19": "These left us. But they never belonged to us. If they had been a part of us, they would have stayed with us. Because they left, it is known they did not belong to us. ", "20": "The Holy Spirit has been given to you and you all know the truth.

The one who says he knows the Son has the Father also.", "24": "Keep in your heart what you have heard from the beginning. Then you will belong to the Son and to the Father if what you have heard from the beginning is in you. ", "25": "And He has promised us life that lasts forever! ", "26": "I have written to you about those who are trying to lead you in the wrong way. ", "27": "Christ gave you the Holy Spirit and He lives in you. You do not need anyone to teach you. The Holy Spirit is able to teach you all things. What He teaches you is truth and not a lie. Live by the help of Christ as the Holy Spirit has taught you.

Then you should know that everyone who is right with God is a child of His."}

Was it the sin of this man or the sin of his parents?\u201d ", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cThe sin of this man or the sin of his parents did not make him to be born blind. He was born blind so the work of God would be seen in him. ", "4": "We must keep on doing the work of Him Who sent Me while it is day. Night is coming when no man can work. ", "5": "While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.\u201d", "6": "After Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground. He mixed it with dust and put that mud on the eyes of the blind man.

They said to him, \u201cGive thanks to God. We know this man is a sinner.\u201d ", "25": "The man who had been blind said to them, \u201cI do not know if He is a sinner or not. One thing I know.

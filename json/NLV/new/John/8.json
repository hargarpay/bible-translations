They made her stand in front of them all. ", "4": "Then they said to Jesus, \u201cTeacher, this woman was caught in the act of doing a sex sin. ", "5": "Moses told us in the Law to throw stones and kill a woman like this. What do You say about it?\u201d", "6": "They were trying to set a trap to find something against Him. Jesus got down and began to write in the dust with His finger. ", "7": "They kept on asking Him. Then He stood up and said, \u201cAnyone of you who is without sin can throw the first stone at her.\u201d ", "8": "Again He got down and wrote in the dust. ", "9": "When they heard what He said, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones until they were all gone. Then Jesus was left alone with the woman.", "10": "Jesus stood up and said to her, \u201cWoman, where are those who spoke against you? Has no man said you are guilty?\u201d ", "11": "She said, \u201cNo one, Sir.\u201d Jesus said to her, \u201cNeither do I say you are guilty.

What You say about Yourself is not true.\u201d", "14": "Jesus said, \u201cEven if I speak of Myself, what I am saying is true. I know where I came from and where I am going. You do not know where I came from or where I am going. ", "15": "You say as a man would say if people are guilty or not guilty. I am not saying anyone is guilty.

No one put his hands on Jesus because His time had not yet come.", "21": "Jesus spoke to the Jews again, saying, \u201cI am going away. You will look for Me but you will die in your sins.

You want to do the sinful things your father, the devil, wants you to do. He has been a killer from the beginning. The devil has nothing to do with the truth. There is no truth in him.

", "7": "He asked them again, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d They said again, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d ", "8": "He said, \u201cI have told you that I am Jesus. If you are looking for Me, let these men go their way.\u201d ", "9": "He said this so the words He spoke might happen, \u201cI have not lost one of those You gave Me.\u201d", "10": "Simon Peter had a sword. He took it and hit a servant who was owned by the head religious leader and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. ", "11": "Then Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut your sword back where it belongs. Am I not to go through what My Father has given Me to go through?\u201d", "12": "Then the soldiers and their captain and the men sent by the Jewish religious leaders took Jesus and tied Him.

They were getting warm by the fire. Peter was standing with them getting warm.", "19": "The head religious leader of the Jews asked Jesus about His followers. He asked Jesus about His teaching. ", "20": "Jesus said, \u201cI have spoken very plain words to the world. I have always taught in the Jewish place of worship and in the house of God. It is where the Jews go all the time. My words have not been said in secret. ", "21": "Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard what I said to them. They know what I said.\u201d ", "22": "Then one of the soldiers standing there hit Jesus with his hand. He said, \u201cIs that how You talk to the head religious leaders?\u201d ", "23": "Jesus said, \u201cIf I said anything wrong, tell Me what was wrong. If I said what was right, why did you hit Me?\u201d ", "24": "Then Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas, the head religious leader. Jesus was still tied up.", "25": "Simon Peter was standing there and getting warm.

At once a rooster crowed.", "28": "They led Jesus from Caiaphas into the court room. It was early in the morning. They did not go inside because their Law said if they did they would become dirty with sin. Then they would not be able to eat the religious supper to remember how the Jews left Egypt.

He asked, \u201cWhat have you to say against the Man?\u201d ", "30": "The Jews said, \u201cIf He had not done wrong, we would not have brought Him to you.\u201d", "31": "Then Pilate said to them, \u201cTake Him yourselves and give Him a trial by your Law.\u201d The Jews said to him, \u201cIt is against our Law to put anyone to death.\u201d ", "32": "This happened as Jesus said it would happen. He had told what kind of death He would die.", "33": "Then Pilate went back into the court room. He called for Jesus and said to Him, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d ", "34": "Jesus said, \u201cDo you ask Me this yourself, or did others say this to you about Me?\u201d ", "35": "Pilate said, \u201cDo you think I am a Jew? Your own people and religious leaders have handed You over to me. What have You done?\u201d ", "36": "Jesus said, \u201cMy holy nation does not belong to this world. If My holy nation were of this world, My helpers would fight so I would not be handed over to the Jews. My holy nation is not of this world.\u201d ", "37": "Pilate said to Him, \u201cSo You are a King?\u201d Jesus said, \u201cYou are right when you say that I am a King. I was born for this reason.

Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.\u201d", "38": "Pilate said to Jesus, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d After Pilate said this, he went out again to the Jews. He said, \u201cI do not find Him guilty. ", "39": "But every year a man who is in prison is allowed to go free at the special religious gathering to remember how the Jews left Egypt. Do you want the King of the Jews to go free?\u201d ", "40": "Then they spoke with loud voices, \u201cNot this Man, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a robber."}

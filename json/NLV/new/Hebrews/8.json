{"1": "Now the important thing is this: We have such a Religious Leader Who has made the way for man to go to God. He is the One Who sits at the right side of the All-powerful God in the heavens. ", "2": "He is the Religious Leader of that holy place in heaven which is the true place of worship. It was built by the Lord and not by men's hands. ", "3": "Every religious leader of the Old Way of Worship had the work of killing animals and of giving gifts on the altar to God. So Christ had to have something to give also. ", "4": "If Christ were on the earth, He would not be a religious leader such as these. The religious leaders on earth give gifts like the Law says. ", "5": "Their work shows us only a picture of the things in heaven. When Moses was putting up the tent to worship in, God told him, \u201cBe sure you make the tent for worship like I showed you on Mount Sinai.\u201d ", "6": "But Christ has a more perfect work. He is the One Who goes between God and man in this new and better way. The New Way of Worship promises better things. ", "7": "If the Old Way of Worship had been perfect, there would have been no need for another one. ", "8": "God was not happy how the people lived by the Old Way of Worship. He said, \u201cThe day will come when I will make a New Way of Worship for the Jews and those of the family group of Judah. ", "9": "The New Way of Worship will not be like the Old Way of Worship I gave to their early fathers. That was when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. But they did not follow the Old Way of Worship. And so I turned away from them. ", "10": "This is the New Way of Worship that I will give to the Jews. When that day comes, says the Lord, I will put My Laws into their minds. And I will write them in their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people. ", "11": "No one will need to teach his neighbor or his brother to know the Lord. All of them will already know Me from the least to the greatest. ", "12": "I will show loving-kindness to them and forgive their sins. I will remember their sins no more.\u201d ", "13": "When God spoke about a New Way of Worship, He showed that the Old Way of Worship was finished and of no use now. It will never be used again."}

", "4": "If any man prays or preaches with his head covered, he does not give honor to Christ. ", "5": "Every woman who prays or preaches without her head covered does not respect her head. It is the same as if she had her hair cut off. ", "6": "If a woman does not cover her head, she might as well cut off her hair also. If a woman is ashamed to have her hair cut off, she should cover her head. ", "7": "Man is made like God and His shining-greatness. For this reason a man should not have his head covered when he prays or preaches, but the woman respects the man. ", "8": "Man was not made from woman.

Nothing good is coming from your meeting together. ", "18": "First of all, I hear that when you meet together in the church you are divided into groups and you argue. I almost believe this is true. ", "19": "For there must be different groups among you. In that way, those who are right will be seen from those who are wrong. ", "20": "When you gather together for your meetings, it is not to eat the Lord's supper. ", "21": "Each one is in a hurry to eat his own food first. He does not wait for others. In this way, one does not get enough food and drink. Others get too much and get drunk. ", "22": "You have your own homes to eat and drink in.

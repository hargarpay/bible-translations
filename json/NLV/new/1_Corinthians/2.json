{"1": "Christian brothers, when I came to you, I did not preach the secrets of God with big sounding words or make it sound as if I were so wise. ", "2": "I made up my mind that while I was with you I would speak of nothing except Jesus Christ and of His death on the cross. ", "3": "When I was with you, I was weak. I was afraid and I shook. ", "4": "What I had to say when I preached was not in big sounding words of man's wisdom. But it was given in the power of the Holy Spirit. ", "5": "In this way, you do not have faith in Christ because of the wisdom of men. You have faith in Christ because of the power of God.", "6": "We speak wisdom to full-grown Christians. This wisdom is not from this world or from the leaders of today. They die and their wisdom dies with them. ", "7": "What we preach is God's wisdom. It was a secret until now. God planned for us to have this honor before the world began. ", "8": "None of the world leaders understood this wisdom. If they had, they would not have put Christ up on a cross to die. He is the Lord of shining-greatness. ", "9": "The Holy Writings say, \u201cNo eye has ever seen or no ear has ever heard or no mind has ever thought of the wonderful things God has made ready for those who love Him.\u201d  ", "10": "God has shown these things to us through His Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit Who looks into all things, even the secrets of God, and shows them to us. ", "11": "Who can know the things about a man, except a man's own spirit that is in him? It is the same with God. Who can understand Him except the Holy Spirit? ", "12": "We have not received the spirit of the world. God has given us His Holy Spirit that we may know about the things given to us by Him. ", "13": "We speak about these things also. We do not use words of man's wisdom. We use words given to us by the Holy Spirit. We use these words to tell what the Holy Spirit wants to say to those who put their trust in Him. ", "14": "But the person who is not a Christian does not understand these words from the Holy Spirit. He thinks they are foolish. He cannot understand them because he does not have the Holy Spirit to help him understand. ", "15": "The full-grown Christian understands all things, and yet he is not understood. ", "16": "For who has the thoughts of the Lord? Who can tell Him what to do? But we have the thoughts of Christ."}

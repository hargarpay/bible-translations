It was while they were giving gifts of animals on the altar in worship to God. ", "2": "Pilate put their blood together with the blood of the animals. Jesus said to them, \u201cWhat about these people from Galilee? Were they worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee because they suffered these things? ", "3": "No, I tell you. But unless you are sorry for your sins and turn from them, you too will all die. ", "4": "What about those eighteen men who were killed when the high building in Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were the worst sinners living in Jerusalem? ", "5": "No, I tell you. But unless you are sorry for your sins and turn from them, you too will all die.\u201d", "6": "Then He told them this picture-story: \u201cA man had a fig tree in his grape-field. He looked for fruit on it but found none. ", "7": "He said to his servant, 'See! For three years I have been coming here looking for fruit on this fig tree. I never find any. Cut it down. Why does it even waste the ground?' ", "8": "The servant said, 'Sir! Leave it here one more year. I will dig around it and put plant food on it. ", "9": "It may be that it will give fruit next year. If it does not, then cut it down.'\u201d", "10": "Jesus was teaching in one of the Jewish places of worship on the Day of Rest.

The leader said to the people, \u201cThere are six days in which work should be done. Come on those days and get healed. Do not come to be healed on the Day of Rest.\u201d ", "15": "The Lord said to him, \u201cYou pretend to be someone you are not!

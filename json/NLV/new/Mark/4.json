", "6": "But it dried up when the sun was high in the sky because it had no root. ", "7": "Some seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew and did not give the seed room to grow. This seed gave no grain. ", "8": "Some seed fell on good ground. It came up and grew and gave much grain. Some gave thirty times as much grain. Some gave sixty times as much grain. Some gave one hundred times as much grain.\u201d ", "9": "He said to them, \u201cYou have ears, then listen!\u201d ", "10": "Those who were with Jesus and the twelve followers came to Him when He was alone.

When sorrow and trouble come because of the Word, they give up and fall away. ", "18": "The seed that was planted among thorns is like some people who listen to the Word.

The time of gathering the grain has come.\u201d", "30": "Jesus said, \u201cIn what way can we show what the holy nation of God is like? Or what picture-story can we use to help you understand?

Many people heard Him. They were surprised and wondered, saying, \u201cWhere did this Man get all this? What wisdom is this that has been given to Him? How can He do these powerful works with His hands? ", "3": "Is He not a Man Who makes things from wood? Is He not the Son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Do not His sisters live here with us?\u201d The people were ashamed of Him and turned away from Him. ", "4": "Jesus said to them, \u201cOne who speaks for God is respected everywhere but in his own country and among his own family and in his own house.\u201d ", "5": "So Jesus could do no powerful works there.

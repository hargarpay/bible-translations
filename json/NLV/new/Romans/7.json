{"1": "Christian brothers, I am sure you understand what I am going to say. You know all about the Law. The Law has power over a man as long as he lives. ", "2": "A married woman is joined by law to her husband as long as he lives. But if he dies, she is free from the law that joined her to him. ", "3": "If she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is sinning by not being faithful in marriage. If her husband dies, she is free from the law that joined her to him. After that she can marry someone else. She does not sin if she marries another man.", "4": "My Christian brothers, that is the way it is with you. You were under the power of the Law. But now you are dead to it because you are joined to another. You are joined to Christ Who was raised from the dead. This is so we may be what God wants us to be. Our lives are to give fruit for Him. ", "5": "When we lived to please our bodies, those sinful desires were pulling at us all the time. We always wanted to do what the Law said not to do. Living that kind of life brings death, ", "6": "but now we are free from the Law. We are dead to sin that once held us in its power. No longer do we follow the Law which is the old way. We now follow the new way, the way of the Spirit.", "7": "Then what are we saying? Is the Law sinful? No, not at all! But it was the Law that showed me what sin is. I did not know it was sin to follow wrong desires, but the Law said, \u201cYou must not follow wrong desires.\u201d ", "8": "The Law made me know how much I was sinning. It showed me how I had a desire for all kinds of things. For without the Law, sin is dead. ", "9": "I was once alive. That was when I did not know what the Law said I had to do. Then I found that I had broken the Law. I knew I was a sinner. Death was mine because of the Law. ", "10": "The Law was supposed to give me new life. Instead, it gave me death. ", "11": "Sin found a way to trap me by working through the Law. Then sin killed me by using the Law.", "12": "The Law is holy. Each one of the Laws is holy and right and good. ", "13": "Then does it mean that the Law, which is good, brought death to me? No, not at all! It was sin that did it. Sin brought death to me by the Law that is good. In that way, sin was shown to be what it is. So because of the Law, sin becomes much more sinful.", "14": "We know that the Law is right and good, but I am a person who does what is wrong and bad. I am not my own boss. Sin is my boss. ", "15": "I do not understand myself. I want to do what is right but I do not do it. Instead, I do the very thing I hate. ", "16": "When I do the thing I do not want to do, it shows me that the Law is right and good. ", "17": "So I am not doing it. Sin living in me is doing it. ", "18": "I know there is nothing good in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do good but I do not. ", "19": "I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I am always doing the sinful things I do not want to do. ", "20": "If I am always doing the very thing I do not want to do, it means I am no longer the one who does it. It is sin that lives in me. ", "21": "This has become my way of life: When I want to do what is right, I always do what is wrong. ", "22": "My mind and heart agree with the Law of God. ", "23": "But there is a different law at work deep inside of me that fights with my mind. This law of sin holds me in its power because sin is still in me. ", "24": "There is no happiness in me! Who can set me free from my sinful old self? ", "25": "God's Law has power over my mind, but sin still has power over my sinful old self. I thank God I can be free through Jesus Christ our Lord!"}

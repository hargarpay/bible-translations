", "3": "I could even wish that I might be kept from being with Christ if that would help my people to be saved from the punishment of sin. They are of my own flesh and blood. ", "4": "They are Jews and are the people God chose for Himself. He shared His shining-greatness with them and gave them His Law and a way to worship. They have His promises. ", "5": "The early preachers came from this family. Christ Himself was born of flesh from this family and He is over all things. May God be honored and thanked forever. Let it be so.", "6": "I am not saying that God did not keep His promises. Not all the Jews are people God chose for Himself. ", "7": "Not all of Abraham's family are children of God. God told Abraham, \u201cOnly the family of Isaac will be called your family.\u201d ", "8": "This means that children born to Abraham are not all children of God. Only those that are born because of God's promise to Abraham are His children.

Rebecca gave birth to two sons at the same time. Both of them were sons of Isaac. ", "11": "Even before the two sons were born, we see God's plan of choosing. God could choose whom He wanted. It could not be changed because of anything the older son tried to do about it. It was before either one had done anything good or bad.

They are given because of His loving-kindness. ", "17": "The Holy Writings say to Pharaoh, \u201cI made you leader for this reason: I used you to show My power. I used you to make My name known over all the world.\u201d  ", "18": "So God has loving-kindness for those He wants to.

He can make two pots from the same piece of clay. One can have an important use. The other one can be of little use. ", "22": "It may be that God wants to show His power and His anger against sin. He waits a long time on some men who are ready to be destroyed. ", "23": "God also wanted to show His shining-greatness to those He has given His loving-kindness.

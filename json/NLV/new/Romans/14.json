It is to his owner that he does good or bad. The Lord is able to help him.", "5": "One man thinks one day is more important than another. Another man thinks every day is the same. Every man must be sure in his own mind. ", "6": "The man who worships on a special day does it to honor the Lord. The man who eats meat does it to honor the Lord.

{"1": "Do the Jews have anything that those who are not Jews do not have? What good does it do to go through the religious act of becoming a Jew? ", "2": "Yes, the Jews have much more in every way. First of all, God gave the Jews His Law. ", "3": "If some of them were not faithful, does it mean that God will not be faithful? ", "4": "No, not at all! God is always true even if every man lies. The Holy Writings say, \u201cSpeak the truth and you will not be proven guilty.\u201d ", "5": "If our sins show how right God is, what can we say? Is it wrong for God to punish us for it? (I am speaking as men do.) ", "6": "No, not at all! If it were wrong for God to punish us, how could He judge the world? ", "7": "If my lies honor God by showing how true He is, why am I still being judged as a sinner? ", "8": "Why not say, \u201cLet us sin that good will come from it.\u201d (Some people have said I talk like this!) They will be punished as they should be.", "9": "What about it then? Are we Jews better than the people who are not Jews? Not at all! I have already said that Jews and the people who are not Jews are all sinners. ", "10": "The Holy Writings say, \u201cThere is not one person who is right with God. No, not even one! ", "11": "There is not one who understands. There is not one who tries to find God.\u201d  ", "12": "Everyone has turned away from God. They have all done wrong. Not one of them does what is good. No, not even one! ", "13": "Their mouth is like an open grave. They tell lies with their tongues.  Whatever they say is like the poison of snakes. ", "14": "Their mouths speak bad things against God. They say bad things about other people.  ", "15": "They are quick to hurt and kill people. ", "16": "Wherever they go, they destroy and make people suffer. ", "17": "They know nothing about peace.  ", "18": "They do not honor God with love and fear.\u201d ", "19": "Now we know that the Law speaks to those who live under the Law. No one can say that he does not know what sin is. Yes, every person in the world stands guilty before God. ", "20": "No person will be made right with God by doing what the Law says. The Law shows us how sinful we are.", "21": "But now God has made another way to make men right with Himself. It is not by the Law. The Law and the early preachers tell about it. ", "22": "Men become right with God by putting their trust in Jesus Christ. God will accept men if they come this way. All men are the same to God. ", "23": "For all men have sinned and have missed the shining-greatness of God. ", "24": "Anyone can be made right with God by the free gift of His loving-favor. It is Jesus Christ Who bought them with His blood and made them free from their sins. ", "25": "God gave Jesus Christ to the world. Men's sins can be forgiven through the blood of Christ when they put their trust in Him. God gave His Son Jesus Christ to show how right He is. Before this, God did not look on the sins that were done. ", "26": "But now God proves that He is right in saving men from sin. He shows that He is the One Who has no sin. God makes anyone right with Himself who puts his trust in Jesus.", "27": "What then do we have to be proud of? Nothing at all! Why? Is it because men obey the Law? No! It is because men put their trust in Christ. ", "28": "This is what we have come to know. A man is made right with God by putting his trust in Christ. It is not by his doing what the Law says. ", "29": "Is God the God of the Jews only? Is He not the God of the people who are not Jews also? He is for sure. ", "30": "He is one God. He will make Jews and the people who are not Jews right with Himself if they put their trust in Christ. ", "31": "Does this mean that we do away with the Law when we put our trust in Christ? No, not at all. It means we know the Law is important."}

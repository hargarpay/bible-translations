", "2": "Then give me true joy by thinking the same thoughts. Keep having the same love. Be as one in thoughts and actions. ", "3": "Nothing should be done because of pride or thinking about yourself. Think of other people as more important than yourself. ", "4": "Do not always be thinking about your own plans only. Be happy to know what other people are doing.", "5": "Think as Christ Jesus thought. ", "6": "Jesus has always been as God is. But He did not hold to His rights as God. ", "7": "He put aside everything that belonged to Him and made Himself the same as a servant who is owned by someone. He became human by being born as a man. ", "8": "After He became a man, He gave up His important place and obeyed by dying on a cross. ", "9": "Because of this, God lifted Jesus high above everything else. He gave Him a name that is greater than any other name. ", "10": "So when the name of Jesus is spoken, everyone in heaven and on earth and under the earth will bow down before Him. ", "11": "And every tongue will say Jesus Christ is Lord. Everyone will give honor to God the Father.", "12": "My Christian friends, you have obeyed me when I was with you.

", "13": "He is working in you. God is helping you obey Him. God is doing what He wants done in you. ", "14": "Be glad you can do the things you should be doing. Do all things without arguing and talking about how you wish you did not have to do them. ", "15": "In that way, you can prove yourselves to be without blame. You are God's children and no one can talk against you, even in a sin-loving and sin-sick world. You are to shine as lights among the sinful people of this world. ", "16": "Take a strong hold on the Word of Life. Then when Christ comes again, I will be happy that I did not work with you for nothing.

", "24": "I hope by the help of the Lord that I can come soon also.", "25": "I thought it was right that I send Epaphroditus back to you. You helped me by sending him to me. We have worked together like brothers. He was like a soldier fighting beside me. ", "26": "He has been wanting to see all of you and was troubled because you heard he was sick. ", "27": "It is true, he was sick. Yes, he almost died, but God showed loving-kindness to him and to me. If he had died, I would have had even more sorrow. ", "28": "This is all the more reason I have sent him to you. When you see him, you will be glad and I will have less sorrow. ", "29": "Take him into your church with joy. Show respect for men like him. ", "30": "He came close to death while working for Christ. He almost died doing things for me that you could not do."}

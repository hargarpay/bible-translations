And she broke the jar and poured it on his head. ", "4": "And there were some who were displeased in themselves and said, Why this waste of oyntment? ", "5": "For it could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor. And they grudged against her.", "6": "And Jesus said, Let her be in rest. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work on me. ", "7": "For you will have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish, you may do them good. But me you will not have always. ", "8": "She has done what she could: she came beforehand to anoint my body for the burial. ", "9": "Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has done will be told, in remembrance of her.", "10": "And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the high priests, to betray him to them. ", "11": "When they heard that, they were glad, and promised that they would give him money. And he sought an opportune way to betray him.", "12": "And the first day of sweet bread, when people offer the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples said to him, Where would you like us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover lamb? ", "13": "And he sent forth two of his disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and there a man will meet you bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him.

", "18": "And as they sat at the table and ate, Jesus said, Truly I say to you that one of you who eats with me will betray me. ", "19": "And they began to mourn, and to say to him one by one, Is it I? And another said, Is it I?", "20": "He answered and said to them, It is one of the twelve, and the same dips with me in the platter. ", "21": "The Son of man goes as it is written of him. But woe is to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed. It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.", "22": "And as they ate, Jesus took bread, blessed, and broke, and gave to them and said, Take, eat; this is my body. ", "23": "And he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank of it. ", "24": "And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.

", "46": "And they laid their hands on him and took him. ", "47": "And one of those who stood by drew out a sword and struck a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.", "48": "And Jesus spoke and said to them, You have come out as if to a thief, with swords and with clubs to capture me. ", "49": "I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not take me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled.", "50": "And they all forsook him, and ran away. ", "51": "And he had a follower, a certain young man clothed in linen upon the bare. And the young men caught him, ", "52": "but he left his linen cloth and fled from them naked.", "53": "And they led Jesus away to the highest priest of all, and to him came all the high priests and the elders and the scribes. ", "54": "And Peter followed him a great way off, right into the palace courtyard of the high priest, and sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.", "55": "And the high priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus, to put him to death, and found none. ", "56": "Yet many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree together. ", "57": "And certain men arose and brought false witness against him, saying, ", "58": "We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. ", "59": "But their testimonies did not agree together.", "60": "And the highest priest stood up amongst them and asked Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing? How is it that these men bear witness against you? ", "61": "And he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the highest priest asked him and said to him, Are you Christ, the Son of the Blessed? ", "62": "And Jesus said, I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.", "63": "Then the highest priest tore his clothes and said, Why do we need any further witnesses? ", "64": "You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think? And they all gave sentence that he was worthy of death. ", "65": "And some began to spit at him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to say to him, Prophesy to us! And the servants struck him on the face.", "66": "And as Peter was below in the interior courtyard, there came one of the servant girls of the highest priest. ", "67": "When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked on him and said, Were you not also with Jesus of Nazareth? ", "68": "And he denied it, saying, I do not know him, or understand what you are saying. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew. ", "69": "And a maidservant saw him and again began to say to those who stood by, This is one of them. ", "70": "And he denied it again. And soon after, those standing by said again to Peter, Surely you are one of them, for you are from Galilee and your speech is the same. ", "71": "And he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know this man of whom you speak. ", "72": "And again the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him \u2013 before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times \u2013 and he began to weep."}

And many who heard him were astonished and said, Where does he have these things from? And what wisdom is this that is given to him? And such miracles that are wrought by his hands! ", "3": "Is this not that carpenter \u2013 Mary's son, the brother of James and Joses, and of Judas and Simon? And are his sisters not here with us? And they were offended by him.

", "10": "And he said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, stay there till you move on from that town. ", "11": "And whoever does not receive you or hear you, when you leave there, shake off the dust that is under your feet, for a witness to them. I say truly to you, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah at the day of judgment than for that place.", "12": "And they went out and preached that the people should repent.

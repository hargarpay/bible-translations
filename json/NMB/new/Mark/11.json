", "3": "And if anyone asks you why you are doing this, say that the Lord has need of him, and straightaway he will send him here.", "4": "And they went their way and found a colt tied by the door outside, in a place where two roads met, and they untied him. ", "5": "And some of the people standing there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt? ", "6": "And they answered just as Jesus had instructed, and the people let them go. ", "7": "And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on it, and he sat upon it. ", "8": "And many spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches of the trees and strew them in the way. ", "9": "And those who went before, and those who followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna! Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord!

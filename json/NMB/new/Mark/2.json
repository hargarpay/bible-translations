", "3": "And there came to him people bringing a paralytic, borne by four men. ", "4": "And because they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof of the house where he was. And when they had broken it open, they let down the bed that the paralytic lay in. ", "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you.", "6": "And certain of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts, ", "7": "How does this fellow so blaspheme? Who can forgive sins, but God only? ", "8": "And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so questioned in themselves, he said to them, Why do you think such things in your hearts? ", "9": "Which is easier to say to the paralytic: Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?

{"1": "In the days when there was a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them, ", "2": "I have compassion on this people, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat. ", "3": "And if I send them away to their own houses without eating, they might faint on the way, because some of them have come from far. ", "4": "And his disciples answered him, Where could anyone obtain bread here in this remote place to satisfy all these? ", "5": "And he asked them, How many loaves do you have? They said, Seven.", "6": "And he directed the people to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them. And they set them before the people. ", "7": "And they had a few small fishes, and he blessed them, and directed them also to be set before the people. ", "8": "And they ate and were filled. And they took up of the broken food that was left seven baskets full. ", "9": "And those who had eaten were in number about 4,000. And Jesus sent them away.", "10": "And shortly he entered into a boat with his disciples, and went into the region of Dalmanutha. ", "11": "And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him. ", "12": "And he sighed in his spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, there will be no sign given to this generation.", "13": "And he left them and went into the boat again, and departed over the water.", "14": "And the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them, and had in the boat with them no more than one loaf. ", "15": "And he charged them, saying, Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. ", "16": "And they deliberated among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.", "17": "And when Jesus knew this, he said to them, Why are you troubled because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts still blinded? ", "18": "Do you have eyes, but not see? And do you have ears, and not hear? Do you not remember? ", "19": "When I broke five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to him, Twelve.", "20": "When I broke seven among four thousand, how many baskets of the leftover fragments did you take up? They said, Seven.", "21": "And he said to them, How is it that you do not understand?", "22": "And he came to Bethsaida, and people brought a blind man to him and asked him to touch him. ", "23": "And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town, and spat in his eyes, and put his hands upon him, and asked him whether he could see anything. ", "24": "And the man looked up and said, I see the people, for I see them walk, as if they were trees. ", "25": "After that Jesus put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him see. And his sight was restored, and he saw every person clearly. ", "26": "And Jesus sent him home to his house, saying, Do not go into the town, nor tell anyone in town about this.", "27": "And Jesus went out with his disciples into the towns around the city called Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, saying, Who do people say that I am? ", "28": "And they answered, Some say that you are John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and some, one of the prophets. ", "29": "And he said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to him, You are the Christ. ", "30": "And he charged them to tell no one of it.", "31": "And he began to teach them how the Son of man must suffer many things, and would be reproved by the elders and by the high priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days arise again. ", "32": "And he spoke this word plainly. But Peter took him aside and began to chide him. ", "33": "Then he turned around and looked on his disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind me, Satan, for you savour not the things of God, but the things of men.", "34": "And he called the people to him with his disciples also, and said to them, Whoever would follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. ", "35": "For whoever would save his life, will lose it. But whoever loses his life for my sake and the sake of the gospel, shall save it. ", "36": "What does it profit a man, if he should win all the world and lose his own soul? ", "37": "Or what can a person give to redeem his soul? ", "38": "Whosoever therefore is ashamed of me and of my words among this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."}

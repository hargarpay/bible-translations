", "3": "Then Jesus put forth this similitude to them, saying, ", "4": "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the countryside and go after the one that is lost until he finds him? ", "5": "And when he has found him, he puts him on his shoulders with joy. ", "6": "And as soon as he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost! ", "7": "I say to you that likewise there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents more than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.", "8": "Or what woman who has ten drachmas, if she loses one, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search diligently till she finds it? ", "9": "And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma that I had lost. ", "10": "Likewise I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.", "11": "And he said, A certain man had two sons, ", "12": "and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the part of the goods that belongs to me. And he divided the substance of his wealth between them. ", "13": "And not long after, the younger son gathered all that he had together, and took his journey into a far country. And there he wasted his goods with riotous living. ", "14": "And when he had spent all that he had, there arose a great dearth throughout all that same land, and he began to be in want. ", "15": "And he went and attached himself to a citizen of that same country, who sent him to his field to keep his swine. ", "16": "And he would gladly have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate, but no man gave to him.", "17": "Then he came to himself and said, How many hired servants at my father's have bread enough, and I am dying of hunger? ", "18": "I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, ", "19": "and am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.", "20": "And he arose and went to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. ", "21": "And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son. ", "22": "But his father said to his servants, Bring forth that best garment and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet. ", "23": "And bring here the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry. ", "24": "For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is now found. And they began to be merry.", "25": "The elder brother was in the field, and when he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing, ", "26": "and called one of his servants and asked what those things meant.

", "30": "But as soon as this your son comes, who has devoured your goods with harlots, you have for his pleasure killed the fatted calf!", "31": "And the father said to him, Son, you were always with me, and all that I have is yours. ", "32": "It was right to make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again, and was lost, and is found."}

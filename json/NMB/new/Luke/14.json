{"1": "And it happened that he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on a Sabbath day, and they were watching him. ", "2": "And there was before him a man who had the dropsy. ", "3": "And Jesus addressed the wise men of law and the Pharisees, asking, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? ", "4": "But they held their peace. And he took the man and healed him, and let him go. ", "5": "And he spoke to them, saying, Which of you, having a donkey or an ox fallen into a pit, would not straightaway pull him out on the Sabbath day? ", "6": "And they could not answer him in reply to that.", "7": "He put forth a similitude to the guests, when he observed how they sought out the seats of honour, and said to them, ", "8": "When you are invited to a wedding by anyone, do not sit down in the highest place, lest a more honourable man than you be bidden by him, ", "9": "and he who invited both him and you come and say to you, Make place for this man \u2013 and you then begin with shame to take the lowest seat. ", "10": "But rather, when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest seat, so that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, sit up higher. Then you will have honour in the presence of those who sit at food with you. ", "11": "For whoever exalts himself will be brought low, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.", "12": "Then he said also to the man who had asked him to dinner, When you give a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends or your brethren, neither your kinsfolk or rich neighbours, lest they return the invitation and a recompense be made you. ", "13": "But when you put on a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind, ", "14": "and you will be happy; for they cannot recompense you, but you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.", "15": "When one of those who sat at food also heard that, he said to Jesus, Happy is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God!\u00a0", "16": "Then Jesus said to him, A certain man prepared a great supper and invited many people. ", "17": "And he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. ", "18": "And they all at once began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a farm, and I need to go and see it; I pray you, have me excused. ", "19": "And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen and I'm going to inspect them; I pray you, have me excused. ", "20": "The third said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.", "21": "And the servant went and brought his master word of this. Then was the lord of the house displeased, and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and quarters of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.", "22": "And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you ordered, and still there is room. ", "23": "And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel the people to come in, so that my house may be filled.

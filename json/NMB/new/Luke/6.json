", "5": "And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath day.", "6": "And it came about in another Sabbath also that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was there a man whose right hand was withered. ", "7": "And the scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal on the Sabbath day, to find an accusation against him. ", "8": "But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stepped forth.

For he is kind to the unkind and to the evil.", "36": "Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful. ", "37": "Judge not, and you will not be judged. Condemn not, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. ", "38": "Give, and it will be given to you: a good measure pressed down, shaken together, and running over will men give into your bosoms. For the measure that you use will be measured back to you.", "39": "And he put forth a similitude to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Do they not both then fall into the ditch?

", "49": "But the person who hears and does not is like a man who built a house without a foundation upon the soil, against which the flood beat, and it fell immediately. And the fall of that house was great."}

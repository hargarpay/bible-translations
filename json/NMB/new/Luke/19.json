{"1": "And he entered in and went through Jericho. ", "2": "And there was a man named Zaccheus, who was a chief publican, and was rich also. ", "3": "And he made efforts to see Jesus, who he was. But due to the press of people, he could not, because he was of a low stature. ", "4": "And so he ran ahead and climbed up into a wild fig tree in order to see him, for he would be coming that way.", "5": "And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacche, come down at once, for today I must stay at your house. ", "6": "And he came down hastily, and brought him home joyfully. ", "7": "And when the people saw that, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to stay with a man that is a sinner.", "8": "And Zacche stood forth and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord: half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have done any man wrong, I will restore him fourfold. ", "9": "And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, seeing that he also has become the child of Abraham. ", "10": "For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.", "11": "As the people listened to these things, he added a similitude, because he was nearing Jerusalem, and also because they thought that the kingdom of God would shortly appear. ", "12": "He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then to return. ", "13": "And he called his ten servants and gave them ten minas, saying to them, Trade with these till I come. ", "14": "But his citizens hated him and sent messengers after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.", "15": "And it came to pass, when the nobleman returned and had received his kingdom, he commanded those servants to whom he had given his money to be called to him, to find out how each had done. ", "16": "Then came the first, saying, Lord, your mina has increased ten minas. ", "17": "And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because you were faithful in a very little thing, you shall have authority over ten cities. ", "18": "And the other came, saying, Lord, your mina has increased five minas. ", "19": "And to him he said, You also shall be over five cities.", "20": "And the third came and said, Lord, here is your mina, which I have kept in a napkin. ", "21": "For I feared you, because you are a hard man. You take where you did not invest, and reap what you did not sow.", "22": "And his lord said to him, By your own mouth I judge you, you evil servant. You knew that I am a hard man, taking where I did not invest and reaping what I did not sow? ", "23": "Why then didn't you put my money into the bank, so that at my coming I could have claimed what is my own with profit?", "24": "And he said to those who stood by, Take from him that mina, and give it the one who has ten minas. ", "25": "And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas!", "26": "I say to you that to all those who have, it will be given, and from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken from him. ", "27": "Moreover, those my enemies who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.", "28": "And when Jesus had thus spoken, he went on ahead, ascending up to Jerusalem. ", "29": "And it so was, when he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, ", "30": "saying, Go into the town which is in front of you, in which, as soon as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat. Untie him and bring him here. ", "31": "And if anyone asks you why you are untying him, thus say to him: The Lord has need of him.", "32": "Those who were sent went their way and found it just as he had said to them. ", "33": "And as they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt? ", "34": "And they said, Because the Lord has need of him.", "35": "And they brought him to Jesus. And they cast their cloaks on the colt and set Jesus thereon. ", "36": "And as he went, people spread their cloaks in the way. ", "37": "And when he came now to where he was to descend from the Mount of Olives, the whole number of the disciples began to rejoice, and to laud God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen, ", "38": "saying, Blessed be the king that comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!", "39": "And some of the Pharisees in the company said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples. ", "40": "He answered and said to them, I tell you, if these held their peace, the stones would cry out.", "41": "And when he came near, he beheld the city and wept on it, ", "42": "saying, If only you had known those things that belong to your peace, at this your very time! But now they are hid from your eyes. ", "43": "For the days will come upon you that your enemies will cast up a siege-mound about you, and compass you around, and hem you in on every side, ", "44": "and lay you level with the ground, with your children who are in you. And they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not acknowledge the time of your visitation.", "45": "And he went into the temple and began to cast out those who sold therein, and those who bought, ", "46": "saying to them, It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.", "47": "And he taught daily in the temple. The high priests and the scribes and the chief men of the people went about to destroy him, but could not find what to do, ", "48": "because all the people stayed close by him, and listened attentively to him."}

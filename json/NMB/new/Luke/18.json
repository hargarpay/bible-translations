And there was a certain widow in the same city, who came to him, ", "3": "saying, Avenge me of my adversary! ", "4": "And he would not for a while. But afterward he said to himself, Though I do not fear God or care about people, ", "5": "yet because this widow is troubling me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out with nagging.", "6": "And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says. ", "7": "And will God not avenge his elect who cry day and night to him \u2013 yea, though he defer them? ", "8": "I tell you, he will avenge them, and that quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, do you suppose he will find faith on the earth?", "9": "And he put forth this similitude to certain people who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others: ", "10": "Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. ", "11": "The Pharisee stood and prayed thus within himself: God, I thank you that I am not like other men are: extortioners, unjust, adulterers \u2013 or like this publican. ", "12": "I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess. ", "13": "But the publican stood afar off, and would not lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God be merciful to me, a sinner. ", "14": "I tell you, this man departed home to his house justified more than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be brought low, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.", "15": "They brought to him also babes, so that he could touch them. When his disciples saw that, they rebuked the people. ", "16": "But Jesus called them to him and said, Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For of such is the kingdom of God. ", "17": "Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child, he shall not enter therein.", "18": "And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what ought I to do to obtain eternal life? ", "19": "Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? None is good, save God only.

Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, and follow me.", "23": "When the man heard that, he was downcast, for he was very rich.", "24": "When Jesus saw him grieve, he said, With what difficulty do those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ", "25": "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ", "26": "Then said those who heard that, And who then can be saved? ", "27": "And he said, Things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.", "28": "Then Peter said, Lo, we have left everything and have followed you.

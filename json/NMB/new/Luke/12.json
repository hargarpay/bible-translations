And that which you have spoken in the ear, even in secret places, shall be declared even on the top of the houses.", "4": "I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. ", "5": "But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you: him fear!", "6": "Are not five sparrows bought for two copper coins? And yet not one of them is forgotten by God. ", "7": "Indeed, even the very hairs of your heads are numbered.

", "2": "Yea, and I went up by revelation, and discussed with them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles (but between ourselves, with those who were counted chief), lest it be thought that I should run or had run in vain.", "3": "Also Titus who was with me, though he was a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.

{"1": "And I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ from a servant, though he be lord of all, ", "2": "but is under tutors and managers until the time appointed by the father. ", "3": "Likewise we, as long as we were children, were in bondage under the ordinances of the world. ", "4": "But when the time was full come, God sent his Son, born of a woman and made bond to the law, ", "5": "to redeem those who were under the law, in order that we through election could receive the inheritance that belongs to the natural sons. ", "6": "Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who cries, Abba, Father! ", "7": "Therefore now you are not a servant, but a son. If you are a son, you are also the heir of God through Christ.", "8": "Notwithstanding, when you did not know God, you served them which by nature are no gods. ", "9": "But now, seeing you know God (yea rather, are known by God), how is it that you turn backward to the weak and poor rudiments, to which again you desire afresh to be in bondage? ", "10": "You observe days and months and times and years. ", "11": "I fear for you, lest I have bestowed on you labour in vain. ", "12": "Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am, for I am as you are. You have not hurt me at all. ", "13": "You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first. ", "14": "And the adversity I suffered by reason of my flesh, you did not turn away or shrink from, but you received me as an angel of God, yea as Christ Jesus. ", "15": "How happy were you then? For I can attest that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. ", "16": "Have I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?", "17": "They are fervent over you amiss. Yea, they intend to exclude you so that you will be fervent for them. ", "18": "It is good always to be fervent, provided it be in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.", "19": "My little children, for whom I travail in birth again until Christ be fashioned in you, ", "20": "I wish I were with you now, and could change my tone. For I am in doubt concerning you. ", "21": "Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, have you not heard of the law? ", "22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free woman. ", "23": "Yea, and the son of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but the son of the free woman was born by promise, ", "24": "which things contain an allegory. For these women are two testaments. The one is from Mount Sinai, which engenders bondage, which is Hagar. ", "25": "For Mount Sinai is called Hagar in Arabia, and corresponds to the city that is now Jerusalem and is in bondage with her children. ", "26": "But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all. ", "27": "For it is written: Rejoice, O barren, who bears no children! Break forth and shout, you who travail not! For the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.", "28": "Brethren, we are like Isaac: children of promise. ", "29": "But just as then he who was born carnally persecuted him who was born spiritually, so also is it now. ", "30": "Nevertheless, what does the scripture say?

{"1": "We know surely that if our earthly abode, the tabernacle we now dwell in, were destroyed, we have an abode prepared by God: a habitation not made with hands, but eternal in heaven. ", "2": "And for this we sigh, desiring to be clothed with our dwelling which is from heaven \u2013 ", "3": "if yet we be found clothed, and not naked. ", "4": "For as long as we are in this tabernacle, we sigh and are grieved. For we would not be unclothed, but would be clothed upon, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life.", "5": "He who has ordained us for this thing is God, the very same who has given to us the earnest of the Spirit. ", "6": "Therefore we are always of good cheer. And we know well that as long as we are at home in the body, we are away from God. ", "7": "For we walk in faith, and see not. ", "8": "Nevertheless, we are of good comfort \u2013 and yet would rather be away from the body, and be present with the Lord.", "9": "And so whether we are at home or away from home, we endeavour to please him. ", "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that every person may receive the works of his body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad. ", "11": "Seeing then that we know how the Lord is to be feared, we fare fair with men. For we are known well enough to God. I trust also that we are known in your consciences. ", "12": "We are not praising ourselves again to you, but give you reason to have confidence in us, so that you may have something to answer to those who put confidence in the face, and not in the heart. ", "13": "For if we are too fervent, it is for God that we are too fervent. If we are restrained, it is for your sakes that we show restraint.", "14": "For the love of Christ constrains us, because we judge this way: if one is dead for all, then all are dead; ", "15": "and that he died for all so that those who live should henceforth live not for themselves, but for him who died for them and rose again. ", "16": "And so henceforth we know no man after the flesh, insomuch that even if we have known Christ after the flesh, now henceforth we know him this way no more. ", "17": "Therefore if any person is in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away: behold, all things are become new.", "18": "Nevertheless, all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the office to preach the atonement. ", "19": "For God was in Christ, and made agreement between the world and himself, and did not impute people's sins to them. And he has committed to us the preaching of the atonement. ", "20": "Now then, we are messengers in the place of Christ, even as though God did beseech you through us. So we entreat you in Christ's stead to be at one with God. ", "21": "For he has made him who knew no sin to be a sin offering for us, so that we, by means of him, should be that righteousness which is accepted before God."}

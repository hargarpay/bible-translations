{"1": "Therefore seeing that we have such an office, even as mercy has come on us, we faint not, ", "2": "but have cast from us the cloaks of dishonesty, and do not walk in craftiness. Neither do we corrupt the word of God, but walk in open truth, and appeal to every man's conscience in the sight of God. ", "3": "If our gospel be yet hid, it is hid among those who are lost, ", "4": "in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.", "5": "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus to be the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. ", "6": "For it is God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, which has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.", "7": "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels so that the surpassing power of it may be seen to be of God, and not of us.

", "17": "For our exceeding tribulation, which is momentary and light, prepares an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory for us, ", "18": "while we look not on the things that are seen, but on the things which are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen, are eternal."}

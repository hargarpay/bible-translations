For I espoused you to one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ. ", "3": "But I fear that, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. ", "4": "For if he who comes preaches another Jesus than him whom we preached, or if you are given another spirit than that which you were given, or another gospel than that which you were given, you might right well be content.", "5": "I suppose that I was not behind the chief apostles. ", "6": "Though I be poor in speaking, yet I am not so in knowledge. However, among you we are known to the utmost, who we are in all things.

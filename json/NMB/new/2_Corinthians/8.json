{"1": "I want you to understand, brethren, of the grace of God that is given in the congregations of Macedonia, ", "2": "how the greatness of their joy is in that they are tried with much tribulation. And moreover, though they were very poor, yet they have given very liberally, and that in sincerity. ", "3": "For as they were able (I am witness), yea and beyond their ability, they were willing of their own accord, ", "4": "and insisted that we take their gift and let them be partakers with others in ministering to the saints. ", "5": "And this they did not as we looked for, but gave their own selves first to the Lord, and after to us by the will of God. ", "6": "So we could not but desire Titus to accomplish the same work of grace among you too, even as he had begun.", "7": "Now therefore, as you are rich in all respects \u2013 in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all ferventness, and in love, which you have to us \u2013 so also see to it that you contribute generously to this gift. ", "8": "I say this, not as commanding, but, seeing others are so fervent, to prove your love also, whether it be perfect or no. ", "9": "You know the munificence of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, though he was rich, yet for your sakes became poor, so that you through his poverty could be made rich.", "10": "And I give counsel in the matter because to do this is proper for you, who began not only to do, but also to will, a year ago. ", "11": "Now therefore perform the deed, so that as there was in you a ready willingness, so also you follow through, out of what you have. ", "12": "For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a person has, and not according to what he does not have.", "13": "It is not my mind that others be set at ease and you be burdened, ", "14": "but, so that there be equality now at this time, that your abundance may relieve their lack, and that their abundance also hereafter may supply your lack \u2013 so that there may be equality, ", "15": "agreeing to that which is written: He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.", "16": "Thanks be to God, who put in the heart of Titus the same good mind toward you. ", "17": "For he accepted the request; yea rather, he was so well willing, that of his own accord he has gone to you. ", "18": "And we have sent with him that brother whose renown is in the gospel throughout all the congregations. ", "19": "And not only this, he has also been chosen by the congregations to be a fellow traveler with us in our journey concerning this gift, which is ministered by us for the praise of the Lord, and to stir up your ready mind. ", "20": "For we want to guard against anyone finding fault with us in this large distribution that we are attending to, ", "21": "and therefore provide for things to be beyond reproach, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of men. ", "22": "And we have sent with them a brother of ours whom we have often found eager to help in many things, but now much more eager. The great confidence that I have in you has caused me to do this \u2013 ", "23": "partly for the sake of Titus, who is my fellow and helper concerning you all, and partly because of others who are our brethren, and the messengers of the congregations, and the glory of Christ. ", "24": "Therefore show them the proof of your love, and of our boasting about you, so that the congregations may see it."}

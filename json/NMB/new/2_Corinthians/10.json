{"1": "I Paul myself beseech you, by the meekness and softness of Christ \u2013 I who when I am present among you am of no reputation, but am bold toward you when absent. ", "2": "I beseech you so that I need not to be bold when I am present (with that same confidence that I am supposed to be bold with) toward some who consider us as though we walked carnally. ", "3": "Nevertheless, though we walk encompassed with the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. ", "4": "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal things, but things mighty in God to cast down strongholds, ", "5": "with which we overthrow imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bring into captivity all understanding to the obedience of Christ, ", "6": "and are ready to take vengeance on all disobedience, when your obedience might come to an end. ", "7": "Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him also consider that as he is Christ's, so also are we Christ's. ", "8": "And if I were to boast somewhat of our authority, which the Lord has given us to build up, and not to break you down, it would not be to my discredit. ", "9": "I say this so that I do not seem as though I went about to make you afraid with letters. ", "10": "For the epistles (says he) are strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is poor. ", "11": "Let such a man think of it this way: that as we are in words by letters when we are absent, such are we in deeds when we are present.", "12": "For we cannot find in our hearts to make ourselves of their number, or to compare ourselves with those who laud themselves, nevertheless while they measure themselves against themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they understand nothing. ", "13": "But we will not boast unduly, but according to the measure of the work that God has assigned to us \u2013 a work that reaches even to you. ", "14": "For we are not overrating ourselves, as if we had not reached to you, because we did reach you with the gospel of Christ. ", "15": "And we do not claim undue credit for other men's labours. Yea and we hope, when your faith is increased among you, to be advanced further in our work, ", "16": "and to preach the gospel in those regions that are beyond you \u2013 and not to boast of that which is prepared already by another man's work.", "17": "But let him who boasts, boast in the Lord. ", "18": "For he who praises himself is not accepted, but he whom the Lord praises."}

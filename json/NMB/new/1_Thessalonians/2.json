{"1": "For you yourselves know, brethren, of our coming to you, how it was not in vain. ", "2": "But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated at Philippi (as you well know), then we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much striving. ", "3": "Our exhortation was not to bring you to error, nor yet to uncleanness. Neither was it with guile, ", "4": "but as we were approved by God to have the gospel committed to us, even so we speak \u2013 not as though we intended to please men, but God, who tries our hearts.", "5": "Neither was our conversation at any time with flattering words, as you well know, nor in cloaked covetousness; God is witness. ", "6": "Nor did we seek praise from men: not from you, nor yet from any others, when we might have imposed ourselves upon you as the apostles of Christ. ", "7": "But we were tender among you. Even as a nurse-mother cares for her children, ", "8": "so was our affection toward you. Our good pleasure was to have given you not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.", "9": "You remember, brethren, our labour and travail. For we laboured day and night, because we did not want to be burdensome to any of you, and preached to you the gospel of God. ", "10": "You are witnesses, and so is God, how holily and justly and blamelessly we conducted ourselves among you who believe;", "11": "as you know how we exhorted and comforted and besought every one of you, as a father his children, ", "12": "to walk worthy of God, who has called you unto his kingdom and glory.", "13": "We thank God without ceasing, because when you received from us the word whereby God was preached, you received it not as the word of man, but even as it was indeed: the word of God, which works in you who believe. ", "14": "For you, brethren, took after the congregations of God in Judea that are in Christ Jesus. For you have suffered similar things from your countrymen as we ourselves have suffered from the Jews. ", "15": "As they killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, even so have they persecuted us. And they do not please God, and are contrary to all men, ", "16": "and oppose us preaching to the Gentiles so that they might be saved, to fulfil their sins always. For the wrath of God has come on them, even to the utmost.", "17": "But since, brethren, we have been kept from you for a season (as to bodily presence, but not in the heart), we tried all the more to see you personally, with great desire. ", "18": "And therefore we would have gone to you \u2013 I, Paul, once and again \u2013 but Satan withstood us. ", "19": "For what is our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? ", "20": "Yes, you are our pride and joy."}

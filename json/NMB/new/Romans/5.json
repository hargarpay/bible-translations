{"1": "Because therefore we are justified by faith, we are at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, ", "2": "by whom we have a way in through faith, to this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory to come, which shall be given by God. ", "3": "Not only that, but we also rejoice in tribulation. For we know that trouble brings patience, ", "4": "patience brings experience, and experience brings hope. ", "5": "And our hope makes not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given to us.", "6": "For when we were yet weak, according to the time, Christ died for us who were ungodly. ", "7": "Yet scarcely will anyone die for a righteous person; perhaps for a good person a man might dare to die. ", "8": "But God sets out the love that he has for us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. ", "9": "Much more then now, seeing we are justified in his blood, will we be saved from wrath through him. ", "10": "For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, seeing we are reconciled, will we be preserved by his life. ", "11": "Not only this, but we also joy in God by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have received reconciliation.", "12": "And so it is just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death by means of sin; and in this way death went over all people, inasmuch as all people sinned. ", "13": "For even to the time of the law, sin was in the world. But where no law is, there sin is not regarded. ", "14": "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those also who did not sin with such transgression as did Adam, who is the similitude of him who is to come.", "15": "But the gift is not like the sin. For if through the sin of one, many are dead, much more lavish upon many was the grace of God and gift by grace, which grace was given by one man: Jesus Christ.", "16": "And the gift is not over only one sin, as death came through one sin of one man who sinned. For the sentence of condemnation came from one sin. But the gift came to justify from many sins. ", "17": "For if by the sin of one, death reigned by the means of one, much more will those who receive of abundant grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life by the means of one; that is to say, Jesus Christ.", "18": "Likewise then, just as by the sin of one, condemnation came on all men, so also by the justifying of one comes the righteousness that brings life upon all men. ", "19": "For just as by one man's disobedience many became sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.", "20": "But the law in the meantime entered in, that sin should increase. Nevertheless, where there was much sin, there was more abundance of grace, ", "21": "so that as sin had reigned unto death, so also grace could reign through righteousness unto eternal life by the help of Jesus Christ."}

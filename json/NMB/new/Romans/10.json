{"1": "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved. ", "2": "For I can attest that they have a fervent heart for God, but not according to knowledge. ", "3": "For they are ignorant of the righteousness that is admitted before God, and go about to establish their own righteousness, and therefore give no heed to the righteousness that is of value before God. ", "4": "For Christ is the end of the law, to justify all who believe.", "5": "Moses describes the righteousness which comes of the law, how the person who does the things of the law will live therein. ", "6": "But the righteousness that comes by faith speaks this way: Say not in your heart, who shall ascend into heaven? (which is nothing else than to fetch Christ down), ", "7": "or, who shall descend into the deep? (which is nothing else than to fetch Christ up from death). ", "8": "But what does the scripture say? The word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart. This word is the word of faith that we preach. ", "9": "For if you acknowledge with your mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and believe with your heart that God raised him up from death, you will be safe. ", "10": "For the belief of the heart justifies, and to acknowledge with the mouth makes a man safe. ", "11": "For the scripture says: Whoever believes on him, will not be ashamed.", "12": "There is no difference between the Jews and the Gentiles. For there is one Lord over all, who richly blesses all who call on him. ", "13": "For: Whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved. ", "14": "But how can people call on him, on whom they have not believed? How can they believe on him, if they have not heard of him? How can they hear without a preacher? ", "15": "And how can men preach, unless they be sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things.", "16": "But they have not all hearkened to the gospel. For Isaiah says: Lord, who believes our message? ", "17": "So then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing comes by the word of God. 18But, I ask, have they not heard?\u00a0 No doubt: Their sound went out into all lands, and their words into the ends of the world.", "19": "But I demand whether Israel did know, or not? First Moses says: I will provoke you to envy by those who are not a people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. ", "20": "Isaiah after that is bold and says: I am found by those who were not seeking me, and have appeared to those who were not asking for me. ", "21": "And against Israel he says: All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people that does not believe, but speaks against me."}

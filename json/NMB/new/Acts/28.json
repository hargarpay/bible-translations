{"1": "And when they had escaped, then they learned that the island was called Malta. ", "2": "And the people of the island showed us no little kindness, for they kindled a fire, and took us in every one, because of the falling rain and because of the cold.", "3": "And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them into the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, which leapt upon his hand. ", "4": "When the islanders saw the venomous snake hanging on his hand, they said among themselves, This man must be a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live. ", "5": "But he shook the snake off into the fire and felt no ill effect. ", "6": "However, they waited for him to swell up or fall down dead suddenly. But after they had waited a great while and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.", "7": "In the same region, the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, had a lordship. He received us and kindly lodged us for three days. ", "8": "And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of dysentery. Paul entered in to him and prayed, and laid his hands on him and healed him. ", "9": "When this was done, others also who had diseases in the isle came and were healed. ", "10": "And they honoured us greatly; and when we departed, they brought on board such things as were necessary.", "11": "After three months, we departed in a ship of Alexandria that had wintered in the island, whose figurehead was Castor and Pollux. ", "12": "And when we came to Syracuse, we stayed there three days. ", "13": "And from there we made a circuit and came to Rhegium. And after one day, the south wind blew. And we came the next day to Puteoli, ", "14": "where we found brethren and were invited to stay with them seven days; and so we went on toward Rome.", "15": "And from Rome, when the brethren heard of us, they came out as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and gained courage. ", "16": "And when he reached Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the chief captain of the host. But Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with one soldier to guard him.", "17": "And it came about after three days that Paul called the chief Jews together. And when they were assembled, he said to them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people or laws of our fathers, yet I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, ", "18": "who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because they found no cause of death in me. ", "19": "But when the Jews cried out against this, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar \u2013 not because I had anything to accuse my people of. ", "20": "So I have called for you in order to see you and to speak with you, because it is for the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.", "21": "And they said to him, We have not received any letters out of Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brethren who came here report or speak any ill of you. ", "22": "But we will hear from you what you think. For we have heard of this sect, that everywhere it is spoken against.", "23": "And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging. To them he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, and preached to them of Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and also out of the prophets, even from morning to night.", "24": "And some believed the things that were spoken, and some did not believe. ", "25": "So in disagreement among themselves they departed, after Paul had spoken one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, saying, ", "26": "Go to this people and say, With your ears you will hear and will not understand, and with your eyes you will see and not perceive. ", "27": "For the heart of this people has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing. And their eyes have they closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted; and I would heal them. ", "28": "Let it be known to you, therefore, that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.", "29": "And when he had said that, the Jews departed, and had great disputations among themselves.", "30": "And Paul dwelt two full years in his lodging, and welcomed all who came to him, ", "31": "preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things that concerned the Lord Jesus with all confidence, unforbidden. Here ends the Actsof the apostles."}

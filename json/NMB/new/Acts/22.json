And I was fervent-minded toward God, as you all are this same day. ", "4": "And I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women, ", "5": "as the chief priest bears me witness, and all the elders \u2013 from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem, to be punished.", "6": "But it came to pass, as I made my journey and had come near to Damascus about noon, that suddenly a great light from heaven shone round about me. ", "7": "And I fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? ", "8": "And I answered, Who are you, Lord?

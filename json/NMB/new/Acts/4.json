", "3": "And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening. ", "4": "However, many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men was about five thousand.", "5": "And it happened on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes, ", "6": "as Annas the chief Priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priests, gathered together at Jerusalem, ", "7": "and set the apostles before them and asked, By what power or in what name have you done this, Sirs?", "8": "Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, ", "9": "if we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the sick man, how he has been made whole, ", "10": "let it be known to you all, and to the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth \u2013 whom you crucified, and whom God raised again from death \u2013 even by him does this man stand here present before you, healed.

", "24": "And when they heard that, they lifted up their voices to God with one accord and said, Lord, you are God who has made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, ", "25": "who by the mouth of your servant David has said: Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

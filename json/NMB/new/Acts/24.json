", "2": "When Paul was called forth, Tertullus began the case against him, saying, Seeing that we live in great quietness owing to you, and that many good things are done for this nation through your prudent government, ", "3": "we receive and acknowledge it ever and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thanks. ", "4": "But in order that I not be tedious to you, I pray that you would kindly hear a few words from us.", "5": "We have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of conflict among all the Jews throughout the world, and a maintainer of the sect of the Nazarites, ", "6": "who has also taken in hand to profane the temple. We took him, and would have judged him according to our law, ", "7": "but the high captain Lysias came upon us, and with great force took him away out of our hands, ", "8": "commanding his accusers to come to you. You may, if you wish to enquire, ascertain from him the facts concerning all these things of which we accuse him.", "9": "The Jews maintained likewise, saying that it was even so.", "10": "Then Paul (after the governor himself had indicated to him that he should speak) answered, I shall with a more quiet mind answer for myself, ", "11": "since I understand that for many years you have been a judge to this people, in order that you may know that it is yet only twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to pray, ", "12": "and they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone, nor inciting the people, neither in the synagogues nor in the city. ", "13": "Nor can they prove the things they accuse me of.", "14": "But this I confess to you: that in accordance with the Way, which they call heresy, so do I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the law and the prophets. ", "15": "And I have hope in God that the same resurrection of the dead that they themselves look for also will come, both of the just and the unjust.

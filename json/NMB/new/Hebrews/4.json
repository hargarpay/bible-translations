{"1": "Let us fear, therefore, lest any of us, forsaking the promise of entering into his rest, should seem to come behind. ", "2": "For to us it has been declared as well as to them. But it did not profit them to hear the word, because they who heard it did not couple it with faith. ", "3": "But we who have believed do enter into his rest, while contrariwise he said to the others: I have sworn in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest. And he spoke this long after the works were made and the foundation of the world laid. ", "4": "For he spoke in a certain place about the seventh day this way: And God did rest on the seventh day from all his works. ", "5": "And then again in this place: They shall not come into my rest. ", "6": "We see therefore that it follows that some will enter into his rest, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter in due to unbelief. ", "7": "Again, speaking in David, he appointed a certain present day after so long a time, saying as mentioned above, this day, if you hear his voice, be not hard-hearted.", "8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day. ", "9": "There remains therefore yet a rest for the people of God. ", "10": "For the person who has entered into his rest does cease from his own works, as God did from his.", "11": "Let us exercise ourselves therefore to enter into that rest, lest anyone should fall into unbelief after the same example. ", "12": "For the word of God is alive and mighty in operation, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and enters through even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and judges the thoughts and intents of the heart; ", "13": "neither is there any creature invisible in the sight of him. For all things are naked and bare to the eyes of him of whom we speak.", "14": "Seeing then that we have a great high priest who has entered into heaven (I mean Jesus, the Son of God), let us hold fast our profession. ", "15": "For we do not have a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one who was in all points tempted like we are, but yet without sin. ", "16": "Let us therefore go boldly to the seat of grace, so that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."}

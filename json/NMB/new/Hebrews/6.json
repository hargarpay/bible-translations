{"1": "Therefore let us leave the questions that belong to the beginning of a Christian life, and let us go on to maturity, and not now again lay the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, ", "2": "of baptism, of doctrine, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection from death, and of eternal judgment. ", "3": "And so will we do, if God permits.", "4": "For it is not possible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were become partakers of the Holy Spirit, ", "5": "and have tasted of the good word of God and of the power of the world to come, ", "6": "if they fall, to be renewed again to repentance, seeing they have (as concerning themselves) crucified the Son of God afresh, making a mock of him. ", "7": "For that earth which drinks in the rain that comes oft upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for those who tend it, receives blessing from God. ", "8": "But that ground which bears thorns and briars is reproved, and is near to cursing: whose end is to be burned. \u00a0", "9": "Nevertheless, dear friends, we trust to see better of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we speak this way. ", "10": "For God is not unrighteous, that he should forget your work and labour that proceeds of love \u2013 which love you have shown in his name, you who have ministered to the saints, and still minister.

", "13": "For when God made promise to Abraham, because he had no greater thing to swear by, he swore by himself, ", "14": "saying: Surely I will bless you and multiply you indeed. ", "15": "And so after he had waited a long time, Abraham enjoyed the promise.", "16": "Men will swear by one who is greater than themselves, and an oath to confirm the thing is among them an end of all strife. ", "17": "So God, wanting very much to show to the heirs of promise the certainty of his counsel, added an oath, ", "18": "so that by two immutable things (in which it was impossible that God should lie) we may have perfect consolation \u2013 we who have fled to hold fast the hope that is set before us, ", "19": "which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast. Which hope also enters in, into those things that are within the veil, ", "20": "to where the forerunner has entered in for us \u2013 I mean Jesus, who is made a high priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."}

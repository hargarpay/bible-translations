{"1": "For the law, which has but the shadow of good things to come, and not the real things themselves, can never, with the sacrifices that the priests offer year by year continually, make those who come to it perfect. ", "2": "For would not then those sacrifices have ceased to be offered, because the offerers, once purged, would have had no more conscience of sins? ", "3": "But in those sacrifices, mention is made of sins every year. ", "4": "For it is impossible that the blood of oxen and of goats should take away sins. ", "5": "Therefore when he comes into the world he says: Sacrifice and offering you would not have, but a body you have made ready for me. ", "6": "In sacrifices and sin-offerings you have no pleasure. ", "7": "Then I said, Lo, I come! In the chief part of the book it is written of me, that I will do your will, O God.", "8": "Above \u2013 when he said sacrifice and offering, and burnt sacrifices and sin-offerings you would not have, neither have accepted (which yet are offered according to the law), ", "9": "and then said, Lo, I come to do your will, O God \u2013 he takes away the first in order to establish the latter. ", "10": "In accordance with this God's will, we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.", "11": "And every priest is ready daily ministering, and repeatedly offers one manner of offering that can never take away sins. ", "12": "But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God, ", "13": "and from henceforth waits till his enemies be made his footstool. ", "14": "For with one offering, he has made perfect forever those who are sanctified.", "15": "And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us of this, namely when he foretold: ", "16": "This is the testament that I will make unto them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their mind I will write them, ", "17": "and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.", "18": "Now where there is remission of these things, there is no more offering for sin.", "19": "Seeing, brethren, that by the means of the blood of Jesus we may be bold to enter into that holy place, ", "20": "by the new and living way that he has prepared for us through the veil (that is to say, by his flesh), ", "21": "and seeing also that we have a high priest who is ruler over the house of God, ", "22": "let us draw near with a true heart, in full faith, sprinkled in our hearts from an evil conscience, and washed in our bodies with pure water. ", "23": "And let us keep the profession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. ", "24": "And let us consider one another, to encourage to love and to good works. ", "25": "And let us not forsake the fellowship that we have among ourselves, as the manner of some is, but let us exhort one another, and that so much the more because you see that the day draws near.", "26": "For if we sin willingly after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins, ", "27": "but a fearful looking for judgment and violent fire, which will devour the adversaries. ", "28": "He who despises Moses' law dies without mercy under two or three witnesses: ", "29": "of how much sorer punishment do you suppose that person will be counted deserving who treads under foot the Son of God, and counts as an unholy thing the blood of the testament by which he was sanctified, and does dishonour to the Spirit of Grace?

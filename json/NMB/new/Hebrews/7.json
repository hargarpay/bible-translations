{"1": "This Melchizedek, king of Salem (who, being priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, ", "2": "to whom also Abraham gave tithes of all the spoils) is by translation of his name, king of righteousness. After that, he is king of Salem; that is to say, king of peace. ", "3": "Without father, without mother, without kin, and having neither a beginning of his days nor yet end of his life, he is likened to the Son of God and continues a priest forever.", "4": "Consider what a man this was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave tithes of the spoils. ", "5": "And now, those children of Levi that received the office of the priests have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law; that is to say from their brethren, yea though they came out of the loins of Abraham. ", "6": "But he whose kindred is not counted among them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises. ", "7": "And without argument, he who is less receives blessing from him who is greater. ", "8": "And here, men who die receive tithes. But there, he receives tithes of whom it is witnessed that he lives. ", "9": "And to say the truth, Levi himself also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham. ", "10": "For he was yet in the loins of his father Abraham when Melchizedek met him.", "11": "If now therefore perfection came by the priesthood of the Levites (for under that priesthood the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not after the order of Aaron? ", "12": "Now no doubt if the priesthood is translated, then of necessity the law must be translated also. ", "13": "For he of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, of which no man ever served at the altar. ", "14": "For it is evident that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, of which tribe Moses said nothing concerning priesthood.", "15": "And it is yet a more evident thing if another priest in the similitude of Melchizedek arises, ", "16": "who is not made priest by the law of the carnal commandment, but by the power of the endless life. ", "17": "For he testifies: You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.", "18": "So then, the previous commandment is abrogated, because of its weakness and unprofitableness. ", "19": "For the law made nothing perfect, but was a preparation for a better hope, by which hope we draw near to God.", "20": "And it is a better hope in that it was not promised without an oath. ", "21": "Those priests were made without an oath, but this priest with an oath, by him that said to him: The Lord swore and will not repent: You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. ", "22": "And thus did Jesus establish and secure a better testament.", "23": "And among the Levites many were made priests, because they were prevented from continuing by death. ", "24": "But this man, because he endures forever, has an everlasting priesthood. ", "25": "Therefore he is able also to save to all eternity those who come to God by him, seeing he lives eternally to make intercession for us.", "26": "Such a high priest it behoved us to have, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than heaven; ", "27": "who does not need (like those high priests) daily to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins and then for the people's sins. For Jesus did that once and for all when he offered up himself. ", "28": "For the law makes priests of men who have infirmity, but the word of the oath that came since the law makes the Son priest, who is perfect forevermore."}

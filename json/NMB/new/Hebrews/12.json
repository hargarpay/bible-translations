", "4": "For you have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed, striving against sin, ", "5": "and have forgotten the consolation that speaks to you as to children: My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked by him. ", "6": "For whom the Lord loves, him he chastens; yea and he scourges every son that he receives.", "7": "If you endure chastening, God offers himself to you as to sons. What son is it whom the father does not correct? ", "8": "If you are not under correction (of which all are partakers), then you are baseborn, and not sons.", "9": "Moreover, seeing we had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reverence, should we not much rather submit to the Father of spiritual gifts, so that we may live? ", "10": "And they for a few short days taught us as it pleased them, but he prepares us for that which is profitable: to receive of his holiness.

Nevertheless, afterwards it brings the quiet fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised by it.", "12": "Stretch forth therefore again the hands that were let down, and the weak knees, ", "13": "and see that you have straight steps for your feet, lest any limping turn you out of the way; yea let it rather be healed. ", "14": "Embrace peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.", "15": "And see to it that no one be destitute of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble, and thereby many be defiled; ", "16": "and that there be no fornicator or unclean person like Esau, who for one breakfast sold his birthright. ", "17": "You know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was put by, and he found no means to come by it again; no, though he sought it with tears.", "18": "For you have not come to the mount that can be touched, and to burning fire, nor yet to mist and darkness and tempest of weather, ", "19": "neither to the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, which voice the people that heard it wished away so that the message would not be spoken to them. ", "20": "For they were not able to abide that which was spoken. If a beast had touched the mountain, it was to have been stoned or thrust through with a dart.

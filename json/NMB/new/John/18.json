", "3": "Judas then, after he had received a band of men, and officers of the high priests and Pharisees, went there with lanterns and firebrands and weapons.", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing all things that would come on him, went forth and said to them, Whom do you seek? ", "5": "They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. Judas who betrayed him also stood with them. ", "6": "But as soon as Jesus had said to them, I am he, they went backwards and fell to the ground. ", "7": "And he asked them again, Whom do you seek? They said, Jesus of Nazareth. ", "8": "Jesus answered, I said to you, I am he. If you seek me, let these go their way.

", "17": "Then the maid that kept the door said to Peter, Are you not one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not. ", "18": "The servants and the officers were standing there, and had made a fire of coals, for it was cold and they were warming themselves. Peter also stood among them and warmed himself.", "19": "The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. ", "20": "Jesus answered him, I spoke openly in the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews come together, and in secret I have said nothing. ", "21": "Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They can tell what I said.", "22": "When he had thus spoken, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus on the face, saying, Is this how you answer the high priest?", "23": "Jesus answered him, If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness of the wrong. If I have spoken well, why do you hit me?", "24": "And Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.", "25": "Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, and they said to him, Are you not also one of his disciples?

For this cause I was born, and for this cause I came into the world: that I should bear witness to the truth. And all who are of the truth hear my voice.", "38": "Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said that, Pilate went out again to the Jews and said to them, I find in him no fault at all. ", "39": "You have a custom that I should set one prisoner free to you at Passover. Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?", "40": "Then they all cried out again, saying, Not him, but Barabbas! Now that Barabbas was a robber."}

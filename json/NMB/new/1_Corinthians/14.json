{"1": "Labour for love, and covet spiritual gifts, and most chiefly to prophesy. ", "2": "For he who speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to people, but to God, for no one understands him. However, in the Spirit he speaks mysteries. ", "3": "But he who prophesies speaks to people, for edifying, for exhortation, and for comfort. ", "4": "He who speaks in an unknown tongue, profits himself; he who prophesies, edifies the congregation.", "5": "I would that you all spoke with tongues, but rather that you prophesied. For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks with tongues \u2013 unless he expounds it also, so that the congregation may have edifying. ", "6": "Now brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I profit you, unless I speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by instruction?", "7": "Moreover, when things without life give sound, whether it be a pipe or a harp, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how can it be known what is piped or harped? ", "8": "And also, if the trumpet gives an uncertain call, who will prepare himself to fight? ", "9": "So also likewise, when you speak with tongues, unless you speak words that have meaning, how can it be understood what is spoken? For you will be but speaking in the air.", "10": "Many kinds of voices are in the world, and none of them are without signification. ", "11": "If I do not know what the voice means, I will be as a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me. ", "12": "So then, since you covet spiritual gifts, seek to have them in plenty for the edifying of the congregation.", "13": "Therefore let him who speaks in an unknown tongue pray such that he may interpret also.", "14": "If I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding brings no one fruit. ", "15": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and will pray with the meaning also. I will sing with the spirit, and will sing with the meaning also. ", "16": "For otherwise, when you bless with the spirit, how can the person who is unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you say? ", "17": "You give thanks well, but the other is not edified. ", "18": "I thank my God that I speak with tongues more than you all, ", "19": "yet in the congregation I would rather speak five words with my meaning for the information of others, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.", "20": "Brethren, do not be children in understanding. As concerning evil, be children, but in understanding be mature. ", "21": "In the law it is written: With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and yet for all that, they will not hear me, says the Lord. ", "22": "Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to those who believe not. On the other hand, prophesying serves not for those who don't believe, but for those who believe.", "23": "If therefore when all the congregation has come together and all speak with tongues, there come in people who are unlearned, or those who do not believe, will they not say that you are out of your minds? ", "24": "But if all prophesy and there comes in one who does not believe, or one unlearned, he is convicted by everyone, and is judged by everyone. ", "25": "And in this way the secrets of his heart are opened, and so he falls down on his face and worships God, and says that God is with you indeed.", "26": "How is it then, brethren? When you come together, each one has his song, has his word, has his tongue, has his revelation, has his interpretation. Let all things be done for edifying. ", "27": "If any man speaks with tongues, let it be two in all, or at the most three in all, and that by turn; and let another interpret it. ", "28": "But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the congregation, and let him speak to himself and to God.", "29": "Let the prophets speak two in all, or three in all, and let the others judge. ", "30": "If any revelation is made to another who sits by, let the first hold his peace. ", "31": "For you may all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn, and all may have comfort. ", "32": "For the spirits of the prophets are in the control of the prophets. ", "33": "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as he is in all other congregations of the saints.", "34": "Let your wives keep silence in the congregations. For it is not permitted to them to speak, but let them be under obedience, as the law says. ", "35": "If they wish to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is unseemly for women to speak in the congregation.", "36": "Did the word of God come forth from you? Or did it come to you only? ", "37": "If anyone thinks himself a prophet, or spiritual, let him understand the things I write to you. For they are the commandments of the Lord. ", "38": "But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.", "39": "And so, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues. ", "40": "And let all things be done decently and in order."}

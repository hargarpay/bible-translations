And the man is the woman's head. And God is Christ's head.\u00a0 ", "4": "Every man praying or prophesying, having anything on his head, dishonours his head. ", "5": "Every woman who prays or prophesies bare-headed dishonours her head, for it is one and the very same thing as if she were shaven. ", "6": "If the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. If it is dishonourable for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her cover her head.\u00a0", "7": "A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God. The woman is the glory of the man, ", "8": "for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. ", "9": "Neither was the man created for the woman's sake, but the woman for the man's sake. ", "10": "For this reason, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head \u2013 for the angels' sakes.

For her hair is given her to cover her with. ", "16": "If there is anyone among you who is inclined to argue, let him know that we have no such custom, nor do the congregations of God.", "17": "Now this I warn you of and do not commend: that you come together not for the better, but for the worse. ", "18": "First of all, when you come together in the congregation, I hear that there is dissension among you. And I believe it as to some, ", "19": "for there must be sects among you, so that those who are sound among you may be known.", "20": "When you come together, a person cannot eat the Lord's Supper, ", "21": "because everyone begins ahead to eat his own supper. And one is hungry, and another is drunk. ", "22": "Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you think nothing of the congregation of God, and shame those who have not?

For the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, ", "24": "and thanked, and broke, and said, Take ye, and eat; this is my body which is broken for you. This do in the remembrance of me. ", "25": "In the same manner he took the cup when supper was done, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood; this do as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.", "26": "For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death till he comes.

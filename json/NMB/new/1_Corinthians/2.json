{"1": "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in gloriousness of words or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. ", "2": "Nor did I show myself to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. ", "3": "And I was among you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling. ", "4": "And my words and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power, ", "5": "so that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.", "6": "That which we speak of is wisdom among those who are sound: not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world (who come to nothing), ", "7": "but we speak the wisdom of God, which is in secret and lies hid, which God ordained before the world for our glory. ", "8": "Which wisdom none of the rulers of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. ", "9": "But as it is written: The eye has not seen and the ear has not heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things that God has prepared for those who love him.", "10": "But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yea, the bottom of God's secrets. ", "11": "For what man knows the things of a man, except the spirit of a man which is within him?

", "14": "For the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God. For they are but foolishness to him. Nor can he perceive them, because they are spiritually examined. ", "15": "But he who is spiritual evaluates all things. Yet he himself is judged by no man. ", "16": "For who knows the mind of the Lord, or who shall inform him? But we understand the mind of Christ."}

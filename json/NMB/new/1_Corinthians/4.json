{"1": "Let people esteem us this way: as the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God. ", "2": "Furthermore, it is required of the stewards that they be found faithful. ", "3": "With me it is but a very small thing if I am judged by you, or by man's day. No, I do not judge my own self. ", "4": "I know nothing against myself, yet I am not thereby justified. It is the Lord who judges me. ", "5": "Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will shed light on things that are hid in darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. And then shall each have praise from God.", "6": "Brethren, I have explained these things with reference to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you might learn from us: so that no one accounts of himself beyond what is written above, so that no one swells against another for any man's cause. ", "7": "For who prefers you? What do you have that was not given to you? If you have received it, why do you glory as though you had not received it? ", "8": "Now you are full, now you are made rich; you reign as kings without us. And I would to God you did reign, so that we might reign with you.", "9": "It seems to me that God has set forth us who are apostles as the lowest of all \u2013 men appointed to death, as it were. For we are a gazing stock to the world, and to the angels, and to men. ", "10": "We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise through Christ. We are weak, and you are strong. You are honourable, and we are dishonoured. ", "11": "Even to this day we both hunger and thirst, and are clothed in rags, and are buffeted with fists, and have no certain dwelling place, ", "12": "and labour, working with our own hands. We are reviled, and yet we bless. We are persecuted, and suffer it. ", "13": "We are ill spoken of, and we pray. We are made as if the refuse of the world, the off-scouring of all things, even to this time.", "14": "I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you. ", "15": "For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. ", "16": "So then, I want you to follow me. ", "17": "For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear son and faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways, which I have in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in all congregations.", "18": "Some swell, as though I will not be coming to you any more. ", "19": "But I will come to you shortly, if God so wills, and will know not the words of those who swell, but the power. ", "20": "For the kingdom of God is not in words, but in power. ", "21": "What would you have? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of gentleness?"}

{"1": "Though I spoke with the tongues of men and angels, and yet had no love, I would be even as sounding brass, or as a ringing cymbal. ", "2": "And though I could prophesy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge \u2013 yea if I had all faith, so that I could move mountains out of their places \u2013 and yet had no love, I would be nothing. ", "3": "And if I bestowed all my goods to feed the poor, and even if I gave my body to be burned, and yet had no love, it profits me nothing.", "4": "Love suffers long, and is kind. Love does not envy. Love is not contrary, does not swell up, ", "5": "does not deal dishonourably, seeks not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinks no evil; ", "6": "does not take pleasure in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; ", "7": "suffers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures in all things. ", "8": "Though prophesying fail, or tongues cease, or knowledge vanish away, yet love never falls away.", "9": "For our knowledge is imperfect, and our prophesying is imperfect. ", "10": "But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is imperfect shall be put away. ", "11": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I imagined as a child. But as soon as I was a man, I put away childishness. ", "12": "Now we see in a glass, even in a dark speaking, but then we shall see face to face. Now I know imperfectly, but then I shall know even as I am known. ", "13": "Now faith, hope, and love, these three things abide, but the chief of these is love."}

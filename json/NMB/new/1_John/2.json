{"1": "My little children, these things I write to you so that you do not sin. Yet if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father: Jesus Christ the Righteous, ", "2": "and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for our sins only, but also for the sins of all the world.\u00a0", "3": "And hereby are we sure that we know him: if we keep his commandments. ", "4": "He who says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. ", "5": "Whoever keeps his word, in him is the love of God perfected in deed. And thereby we know that we are in him. ", "6": "He who says he abides in him, ought to walk even as he walked.", "7": "Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but that old commandment that you heard from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you heard from the beginning. ", "8": "Again, a new commandment I write to you: a thing that is true in him and also in you. For the darkness is past, and the true light now shines. ", "9": "He who says that he is in the light, and yet hates his brother, is in darkness even until this time. ", "10": "He who loves his brother, abides in the light, and there is no occasion of evil in him. ", "11": "He who hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and does not know where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.", "12": "Babes, I write to you because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. ", "13": "I write to you fathers, because you know him who was from the beginning. I write to you young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you little children, because you know the Father. ", "14": "I write to you fathers, because you know him who was from the beginning. I write to you young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome that wicked one.", "15": "See that you love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. ", "16": "For all that is in the world (as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of goods) is not of the Father, but of the world. ", "17": "And the world is vanishing away, and the desires of it. But he who fulfils the will of God endures forever.", "18": "Little children, it is the last time. And as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists come already. By this we know that it is the last time. ", "19": "They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But this happened so that it might appear that they were not of us.", "20": "And you have an anointing of the Holy Spirit, and you know all things. ", "21": "I did not write to you as though you did not know the truth, but as knowing it, and as knowing also that no lie comes of truth. ", "22": "Who is a liar, but he who denies that Jesus is Christ? He is the Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son. ", "23": "Whoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father.", "24": "Let therefore abide in you that which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will continue in the Son and in the Father. ", "25": "And the promise that he has promised us is eternal life.", "26": "This I have written to you concerning those who deceive you.", "27": "And the anointing that you have received from him dwells in you, and you need not that any man teach you \u2013 but as the anointing teaches you all things, and is true, and is no lie, and as it taught you, even so abide therein.", "28": "And now babes, abide in him, so that when he appears, we may be bold, and not be made ashamed before him at his coming. ", "29": "If you know that he is righteous, know also that he who follows righteousness, is born of him."}

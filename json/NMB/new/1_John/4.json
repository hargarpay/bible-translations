", "3": "And every spirit which does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is not of God; and this is the spirit of Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he would come. And even now already he is in the world.", "4": "Little children, you are of God, and have overcome them. For greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. ", "5": "They are of the world, and therefore what they say is of the world, and the world hears them. ", "6": "We are of God. He who knows God, hears us. He who is not of God, does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.", "7": "Beloveds, let us love one another. For love comes of God. And every one who loves is born of God and knows God. ", "8": "He who does not love, does not know God. For God is love.", "9": "In this did the love of God for us appear: that God sent his only begotten Son into the world so that we may live through him.

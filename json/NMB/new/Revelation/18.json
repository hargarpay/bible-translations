", "3": "For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and her merchants were made rich from the abundance of her pleasures.", "4": "And I heard another voice from heaven say, Come away from her, my people, that you be not partakers in her sins, that you receive not of her plagues. ", "5": "For her sins have gone up to heaven, and God has remembered her wickedness. ", "6": "Reward her even as she rewarded you, and give her double according to her works. And pour in double for her, in the same cup that she filled for you. ", "7": "And as much as she glorified herself and lived wantonly, so much pour in for her of punishment and sorrow. For she said in herself, I sit being a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. ", "8": "Therefore her plagues shall come at one day: death, and sorrow, and hunger; and she will be burnt with fire.

For at one hour has her judgment come.", "11": "And the merchants of the earth will weep and wail in themselves, because no one will buy their wares any more \u2013 ", "12": "wares of gold and silver and precious stones, neither of pearl, and fine linens, and purple and scarlet cloth; and all fragrant wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass and iron; ", "13": "and cinnamon and incense, and oyntments, frankincense, wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat; and work animals, and sheep, and horses, and chariots; and bodies and souls of men.", "14": "And the apples that your soul lusted after are departed from you. And all things that were choice and precious to you are departed from you, and you shall find them no more.

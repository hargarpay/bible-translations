{"1": "And when Jesus had made an end of instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and to preach in their towns.", "2": "When John, being in prison, heard about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples ", "3": "and asked him, Are you he that was to come, or should we look for another? ", "4": "Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John what you have heard and seen: ", "5": "the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise up again, and the glad tidings are preached to the poor. ", "6": "And blessed is the person who is not offended by me.", "7": "And as they departed, Jesus began to speak to the people about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? Did you go to see a reed shaken with the wind? ", "8": "Or what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. ", "9": "But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. ", "10": "For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.", "11": "Truly I say to you, among the children of women none greater than John the Baptist has arisen. Notwithstanding, he who is less in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.", "12": "From the time of John the Baptist to now, the kingdom of heaven is sorely pressed, and those who go to it with effort seize it for themselves.

It is like children who sit in the market and call to their fellows, ", "17": "and say, We have piped to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you have not sorrowed. ", "18": "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say he has the devil. ", "19": "The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Here is a glutton and drinker of wine, and a friend of publicans and sinners! Nevertheless, wisdom is justified by her children.", "20": "Then Jesus began to upbraid the places in which most of his miracles had been done, because they did not turn: ", "21": "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were shown in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ", "22": "But I say to you, it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. ", "23": "And you Capernaum, who are lifted up to heaven, shall be brought down to hell.

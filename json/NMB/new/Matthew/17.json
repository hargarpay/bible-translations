{"1": "And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and James' brother John, and brought them up into a high mountain out of the way. ", "2": "And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine like the sun, and his clothes were as white as the light. ", "3": "And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.", "4": "Then Peter spoke and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. If you will, let us make here three tabernacles: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.", "5": "While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud covered them. And behold, there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dear Son, in whom I delight. Hear him!", "6": "When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were sore afraid. ", "7": "And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid. ", "8": "And when they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus only.", "9": "And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, See that you tell no one about the vision until the Son of man is risen up again from death. ", "10": "And his disciples asked of him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? ", "11": "Jesus answered and said to them, Elijah does come first, and restore all things. ", "12": "And I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him, but have done to him whatever they pleased. In like manner will the Son of man also suffer at their hands. ", "13": "Then the disciples perceived that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.", "14": "And when they had come to the people, a certain man came to Jesus and kneeled down to him and said, ", "15": "Master, have mercy on my son, for he is delirious, and is sorely vexed. And often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. ", "16": "And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him. ", "17": "Jesus answered and said, O generation faithless and perverse, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.", "18": "And Jesus rebuked the devil, and he came out of him. And the child was healed even at that same hour.", "19": "Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, Why could we not cast him out? ", "20": "Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For I say truly to you, if you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, Move over there, and it would move; neither should anything be impossible for you to do. ", "21": "However, this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.", "22": "As they passed the time in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men, ", "23": "and they will kill him; and the third day he will rise again. And they sorrowed greatly.", "24": "And when they had come to Capernaum, men that collected the poll money came to Peter and asked, Does your teacher pay tribute? ", "25": "He said, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus spoke first to him, saying, What do you think, Simon: from whom do the kings of the earth take tribute or poll money? From their children, or from others? ", "26": "Peter answered, From others. And Jesus said to him, Then the children are free. ", "27": "Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea and cast in your hook, and take the fish that first comes up. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a coin. Take it, and pay for me and you."}

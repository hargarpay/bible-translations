{"1": "Then the kingdom of heaven will be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. ", "2": "Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. ", "3": "The foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them. ", "4": "But the wise took oil with them in their vessels, with their lamps also.", "5": "While the bridegroom tarried, all slumbered and slept. ", "6": "And right at midnight there was a cry made: Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go out to meet him! ", "7": "Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lamps. ", "8": "And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. ", "9": "But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.", "10": "And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came. And those who were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the gate was shut up. ", "11": "Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us! ", "12": "But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.", "13": "Watch, therefore. For you know neither the day nor yet the hour when the Son of man will come.", "14": "Likewise it will be as a certain man, ready to take his journey to a strange country, called his servants and delivered his goods to them. ", "15": "And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one \u2013 to every man according to his ability \u2013 and straightaway departed. ", "16": "Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and won another five talents. ", "17": "Likewise, he who received two gained another two. ", "18": "But he who received the one went and dug a hole in the earth, and hid his master's money.", "19": "After a long season, the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them. ", "20": "Then came he that had received five talents, and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have gained with them five talents more. ", "21": "Then his master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a little; I will appoint you over much. Enter into your master's joy!", "22": "Also he who received two talents came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have won two other talents with them. ", "23": "And his master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a little; I will appoint you over much. Go in, into your master's joy.", "24": "Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Master, I considered that you were a hard man, who reaps where you did not sow and gathers where you did not scatter, ", "25": "and was therefore afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth. Here, have your talent.", "26": "His master answered and said to him, You evil servant, and slothful: you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? ", "27": "You ought therefore to have put my money with the moneychangers, and then at my coming I would have received what is my own with profit. ", "28": "Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to the one who has ten talents. ", "29": "For every person who has will be given more, and he will have abundance; and from him who has not, shall be taken away even what he has. ", "30": "And cast that unprofitable servant into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.", "31": "When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his glory. ", "32": "And before him shall be gathered all nations. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. ", "33": "And he will set the sheep on his right hand and the goats on the left. ", "34": "Then shall the king say to those on his right hand, Come ye blessed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. ", "35": "For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was homeless and you lodged me. ", "36": "I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.", "37": "Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Master, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? ", "38": "When did we see you homeless and lodge you, or naked and clothe you? ", "39": "Or when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you? ", "40": "And the king will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it for one of the least of these my brethren, you did it for me.", "41": "Then shall the king say to those who will be on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels. ", "42": "For I was hungry and you gave me no food. I was thirsty and you gave me no drink. ", "43": "I was homeless and you did not lodge me. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.", "44": "Then they also will answer him, saying, Master, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or homeless, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you? ", "45": "Then shall he answer them and say, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it not for one of the least of these, you did it not for me. ", "46": "And these shall go into everlasting pain, but the righteous into life eternal."}

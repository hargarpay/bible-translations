And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you. ", "3": "And certain of the scribes said in themselves, This man blasphemes.", "4": "When Jesus saw their thoughts, he said, Why do you think evil in your hearts? ", "5": "Which is easier to say: Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk? ", "6": "But so that you may know that the Son of man has power to forgive sins in earth\u2013 Then he said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed, and go home to your house. ", "7": "And the man arose and departed to his own house. ", "8": "And when the people saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God who had given such power to men.", "9": "And as Jesus passed onwards from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.", "10": "And it came to pass, as he sat at food in Matthew's house, that many publicans and sinners came and sat down also with Jesus and his disciples. ", "11": "When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?", "12": "When Jesus heard this, he said to them, The whole do not need the physician, but they that are sick. ", "13": "Go and learn what this means: I have pleasure in mercy, and not in offering. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.", "14": "Then John's disciples came to him, asking, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?

", "16": "No one patches an old garment with a piece of new cloth. For then the new piece pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made greater. ", "17": "Neither do men put new wine into old wineskins, for then the skins burst, the wine runs out, and the vessels are destroyed. But they pour new wine into new wineskins, and so both are preserved together.", "18": "While he was thus speaking to them, a certain leader came and did reverence to him, saying, My daughter is even now deceased. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live. ", "19": "And Jesus arose and followed him with his disciples.", "20": "And behold, a woman who had been diseased for 12 years with an issue of blood came up behind him and touched the hem of his vesture. ", "21": "For she said in herself, If I may touch but even his vesture only, I will be healed. ", "22": "Then Jesus, turning about and seeing her, said, Daughter, be of good comfort; your faith has made you whole. And she was healed even that same hour.", "23": "And when Jesus came into the leader's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ", "24": "he said to them, All of you, go away, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they laughed him to scorn. ", "25": "But as soon as the people were put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.

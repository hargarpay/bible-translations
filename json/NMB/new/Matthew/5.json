{"1": "When Jesus saw the crowds of people, he went up into a mountain. And when he was seated, his disciples came to him. ", "2": "And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:", "3": "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.", "4": "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.", "5": "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.", "6": "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.", "7": "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.", "8": "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.", "9": "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.", "10": "Blessed are those who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ", "11": "Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and falsely say all manner of evil things against you for my sake. ", "12": "Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For in the same way they persecuted the prophets that were before your days.", "13": "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost her saltness, what can be salted with it? It is thereafter good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot by men.", "14": "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. ", "15": "Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it gives light to all who are in the house. ", "16": "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.", "17": "Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. No, I have not come to destroy them, but to fulfil them. ", "18": "For truly I say to you, till heaven and earth perish, not one jot or one tittle of the law shall escape, till all be fulfilled. ", "19": "Whosoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, he will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whosoever observes and teaches them, the same will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ", "20": "For I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.", "21": "You have heard how it was said to the people of the old time, You shall not kill. For whosoever kills will be liable to judgment. ", "22": "But I say to you, whosoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Whosoever says to his brother, Racha! will be liable to a council. But whosoever says, You fool! will be liable to hell fire.", "23": "Therefore when you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, ", "24": "leave your offering there before the altar, and go your way first and be reconciled to your brother; and then come and offer your gift.", "25": "Reconcile with your adversary quickly while you are in the way with him, lest the adversary commit you to the judge, and the judge commit you to the officer, and then you be cast into prison. ", "26": "Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there till you have paid the last penny.", "27": "You have heard how it was said to the people of the old time, You shall not commit adultery. ", "28": "But I say to you that whosoever looks on a wife, lusting after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart. ", "29": "Therefore if your right eye causes you to offend, tear it out and cast it from you. It is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body should be cast into hell. ", "30": "Also, if your right hand causes you to offend, cut it off and cast it from you. Better it is that one of your members perish, than that all your body should be cast into hell.", "31": "It is said, Whosoever puts away his wife, let him give her a testimonial also of the divorce. ", "32": "But I say to you, whosoever puts away his wife (unless it be for fornication), causes her to break matrimony. And whoever marries her who is divorced, breaks wedlock.", "33": "Again, you have heard how it was said to the people of old time, Do not forswear yourself, but perform your oath to God. ", "34": "But I say to you, do not swear at all \u2013 neither by heaven, for it is God's seat, ", "35": "nor yet by the earth, for it his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of that great king. ", "36": "Neither should you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. ", "37": "But let your communication be yes, yes, and no, no. For whatever is more than that, comes of evil.", "38": "You have heard how it is said, An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. ", "39": "But I say to you, do not resist wrong. But whosoever gives you a blow on your right cheek, turn to him the other. ", "40": "And if any man would sue you at law and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. ", "41": "And whoever would compel you to go a mile, go with him two. ", "42": "Give to him who asks, and from him who would borrow, turn not away.", "43": "You have heard how it is said, You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. ", "44": "But I say to you, love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for those who do you wrong and persecute you, ", "45": "so that you may be the children of your Father that is in heaven. For he makes his sun to arise on the evil and on the good, and sends his rain on the just and the unjust. ", "46": "For if you love those who love you, what reward should you have? Do not the publicans do the same? ", "47": "And if you are friendly to your brethren only, what singular thing are you doing? Do not the publicans do likewise? ", "48": "You must therefore be perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect."}

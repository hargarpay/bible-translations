{"1": "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.", "2": "I have fed you with milk and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able,", "3": "for ye are yet carnal. For if there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal and walk as men?", "4": "For while one saith, \u201cI am of Paul,\u201d and another, \u201cI am of Apollos,\u201d are ye not carnal?", "5": "Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye came to believe, even as the Lord gave to every man?", "6": "I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.", "7": "So then, neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God who giveth the increase.", "8": "Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.", "9": "For we are laborers together with God; ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.", "10": "According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.", "11": "For no man can lay another foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.", "12": "Now if any man build upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,", "13": "every man's work shall be made manifest; for the Day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall test every man's work of what sort it is.", "14": "If any man's work abide which he hath built thereon, he shall receive a reward.", "15": "If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as fire.", "16": "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?", "17": "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, and ye are that temple.", "18": "Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.", "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: \u201cHe taketh the wise in their own craftiness\u201d;", "20": "and again, \u201cThe Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\u201d", "21": "Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours,", "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come \u2014 all are yours,", "23": "and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's."}

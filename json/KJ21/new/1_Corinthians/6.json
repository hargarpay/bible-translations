And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?", "3": "Know ye not that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?", "4": "If then ye have judgments to make on things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church!", "5": "I speak to shame you! Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, no, not one, who shall be able to judge between his brethren?", "6": "But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers!", "7": "Now therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one against another. Why do ye not rather accept wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?", "8": "Nay, ye do wrong and defraud, and that your own brethren!", "9": "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,", "10": "nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God.", "11": "And such were some of you.

Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.", "14": "And God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us by His own power.", "15": "Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? God forbid!", "16": "What? Know ye not that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? \u201cFor two,\u201d saith He, \u201cshall be one flesh.\u201d", "17": "But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.", "18": "Flee fornication. Every other sin which a man doeth is outside the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.", "19": "What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you and which ye have from God, and that ye are not your own?", "20": "For ye are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's."}

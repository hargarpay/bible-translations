But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.", "7": "For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, inasmuch as he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.", "8": "For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.", "9": "Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.", "10": "For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head, because of the angels.", "11": "Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.", "12": "For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.", "13": "Judge for yourselves: Is it comely that a woman should pray unto God uncovered?", "15": "But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given her for a covering.", "16": "But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.", "17": "Now in this I declare unto you that I praise you not: that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.", "18": "For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.", "19": "For there must be also heresies among you, that those who are approved may be made manifest among you.", "20": "When ye therefore come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.", "21": "For in eating, every one taketh his own supper ahead of another, and one is hungry and another is drunken.", "22": "What?

{"1": "Now when Festus had come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.", "2": "Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews informed him against Paul and besought him,", "3": "desiring a favor against him: that he would have Paul brought to Jerusalem, so that they might lie in wait on the way to kill him.", "4": "But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.", "5": "\u201cLet those therefore,\u201d he said, \u201cwho among you are able, go down with me and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.\u201d", "6": "And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea. And the next day, sitting in the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.", "7": "And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove,", "8": "while Paul answered for himself: \u201cNeither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor yet against Caesar have I offended any thing at all.\u201d", "9": "But Festus, desiring to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, \u201cWilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me?\u201d", "10": "Then said Paul, \u201cI stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged.

(This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.)", "4": "And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.", "5": "Peter therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing by the church unto God for him.", "6": "And when Herod would have brought him forth, that same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers were guarding the door of the prison.", "7": "And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, \u201cArise up quickly.\u201d And his chains fell off from his hands.", "8": "And the angel said unto him, \u201cGird thyself and bind on thy sandals.\u201d And so he did. And the angel said unto him, \u201cCast thy garment about thee and follow me.\u201d", "9": "And he went out and followed him, and knew not whether what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.", "10": "When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city, which opened to them of his own accord. And they went out and passed on through one street, and forthwith the angel departed from him.", "11": "And when Peter had come to himself, he said, \u201cNow I know in truth that the Lord hath sent His angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectations of the people of the Jews.\u201d", "12": "And when he had considered this thing, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying.", "13": "And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel named Rhoda came to ask who was there.", "14": "And when she recognized Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate.", "15": "And they said unto her, \u201cThou art mad.\u201d But she continued to affirm that it was even so.

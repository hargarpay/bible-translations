One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.\u201d", "26": "Then said they to him again, \u201cWhat did he do to thee? How opened he thine eyes?\u201d", "27": "He answered them, \u201cI have told you already, and ye did not hear. Why would ye hear it again? Will ye also be his disciples?\u201d", "28": "Then they reviled him and said, \u201cThou art his disciple, but we are Moses' disciples.", "29": "We know that God spoke unto Moses. As for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.\u201d", "30": "The man answered and said unto them, \u201cWhy, herein is a marvelous thing: that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.", "31": "Now we know that God heareth not sinners, but if any man be a worshiper of God and doeth His will, him He heareth.", "32": "Since the world began it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one who was born blind.", "33": "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\u201d", "34": "They answered and said unto him, \u201cThou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?\u201d And they cast him out.", "35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out.

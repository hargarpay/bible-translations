Now it was the Sabbath on that day.", "10": "The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, \u201cIt is the Sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.\u201d", "11": "He answered them, \u201cHe that made me whole said unto me, 'Take up thy bed and walk.'\u201d", "12": "Then they asked him, \u201cWhat man is that who said unto thee, 'Take up thy bed and walk'?\u201d", "13": "And he that was healed knew not who it was, for Jesus had removed Himself away, a multitude being in that place.", "14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him, \u201cBehold, thou art made whole.

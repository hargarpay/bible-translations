But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground, as though He heard them not.", "7": "So when they continued asking Him, He lifted Himself up and said unto them, \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d", "8": "And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.", "9": "And they who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the eldest even unto the last, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing in the midst.", "10": "When Jesus had lifted Himself up and saw none but the woman, He said unto her, \u201cWoman, where are those thine accusers?

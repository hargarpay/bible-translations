{"1": "O foolish Galatians! Who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been clearly set forth, crucified among you?", "2": "This only would I learn of you: Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?", "3": "Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?", "4": "Have ye suffered so many things in vain \u2014 if it be yet in vain?", "5": "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you, doeth He it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?", "6": "Even as Abraham \u201cbelieved God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.\u201d", "7": "Know ye therefore that those who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.", "8": "And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached beforehand the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, \u201cIn thee shall all nations be blessed.\u201d", "9": "So then, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.", "10": "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written: \u201cCursed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.\u201d", "11": "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for \u201cthe just shall live by faith.\u201d", "12": "And the law is not of faith, but \u201cThe man who doeth them shall live in them.\u201d", "13": "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written, \u201cCursed is every one who hangeth on a tree\u201d),", "14": "that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.", "15": "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: A covenant, though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man annulleth or addeth thereto.", "16": "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, \u201cand to seeds,\u201d as though many; but as though one: \u201cand to thy Seed,\u201d who is Christ.", "17": "And this I say, that the Covenant which was confirmed earlier by God in Christ cannot be annulled by the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, so as to make the promise of no effect.", "18": "For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.", "19": "For what then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and itwas ordained by angels through the hand of a mediator.", "20": "Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.", "21": "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should then have come by the law.", "22": "But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.", "23": "But before faith came, we were kept under the law, being shut apart from the faith which should afterwards be revealed.", "24": "Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.", "25": "But after faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.", "26": "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.", "27": "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.", "28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.", "29": "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise."}

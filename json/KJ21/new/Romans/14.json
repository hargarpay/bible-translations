To his own master he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be held up, for God is able to make him stand.", "5": "One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.", "6": "He that regardeth one day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not that day, to the Lord doth he not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks.", "7": "For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.", "8": "For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.", "9": "For to this end Christ both died, and arose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.", "10": "But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at nought thy brother?

Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.", "16": "Let not your good be spoken of as evil;", "17": "for the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.", "18": "For he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God and approved by men.", "19": "Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and the things wherewith one may edify another.", "20": "Destroy not the work of God for the sake of meat. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for that man to eat what causeth offense.", "21": "It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.", "22": "Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.", "23": "And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not from faith; for whatsoever is not from faith is sin."}

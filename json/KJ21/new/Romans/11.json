Know ye not what the Scripture saith of Elijah, how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed Thy prophets and torn down Thine altars, and I am left alone and they seek my life\u201d?", "4": "But what saith the answer of God unto him? \u201cI have reserved to Myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.\u201d", "5": "Even so then, at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.", "6": "And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it be by works, then it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.", "7": "What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded,", "8": "according as it is written: \u201cGod hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.\u201d", "9": "And David saith, \u201cLet their table be made a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a recompense unto them.", "10": "Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their backs alway.\u201d", "11": "I say then: Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid! But rather, through their fall salvation has come unto the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy.", "12": "Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness?", "13": "For I speak to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my office,", "14": "that by any means I may provoke to emulation those who are my flesh, and might save some of them.", "15": "For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?", "16": "For if the firstfruit be holy, the whole lump is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches.", "17": "And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree,", "18": "boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.", "19": "Thou wilt say then, \u201cThe branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.\u201d", "20": "Thou sayest well! Because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear;", "21": "for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee.", "22": "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness. Otherwise, thou also shalt be cut off.", "23": "And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.", "24": "For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?", "25": "For I, brethren, would not have you be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.", "26": "And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written: \u201cThere shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.", "27": "For this is My covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins.\u201d", "28": "Concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.", "29": "For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.", "30": "For as in times past ye have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief,", "31": "even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.", "32": "For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all.", "33": "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!", "34": "\u201cFor who hath known the mind of the Lord?

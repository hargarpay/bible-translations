{"1": "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,", "2": "by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.", "3": "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;", "4": "and patience, experience; and experience, hope;", "5": "and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given unto us.", "6": "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.", "7": "For scarcely will one die for a righteous man, yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.", "8": "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.", "9": "Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.", "10": "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.", "11": "And not only that, but we shall also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.", "12": "Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death passed onto all men, for all have sinned.", "13": "For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.", "14": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the similitude of Adam's transgression, he being the figure of Him that was to come.", "15": "But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.", "16": "And not as it was by one who sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is for many offenses unto justification.", "17": "For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.", "18": "Therefore as by the offense of one, judgment to condemnation came upon all men, even so by the righteousness of One, the free gift unto justification of life came upon all men.", "19": "For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.", "20": "Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,", "21": "that, as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."}

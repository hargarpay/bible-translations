{"1": "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?", "2": "God forbid! How shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?", "3": "Know ye not that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?", "4": "Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.", "5": "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, so we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,", "6": "knowing this: that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.", "7": "For he that is dead is freed from sin.", "8": "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,", "9": "knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over Him.", "10": "For in that He died, He died unto sin once; but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God.", "11": "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.", "12": "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.", "13": "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.", "14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace.", "15": "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid!", "16": "Know ye not that to whomever ye yield yourselves as servants to obey, his servants ye become whom ye obey, whether of sin which leads unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?", "17": "But God be thanked that though ye were the servants of sin, now ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.", "18": "Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.", "19": "I speak in the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as ye have yielded your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members as servants to righteousness unto holiness.", "20": "For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.", "21": "What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.", "22": "But now, being made free from sin and having become servants of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end, everlasting life.", "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."}

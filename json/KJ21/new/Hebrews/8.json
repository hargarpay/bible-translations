For, \u201cSee,\u201d saith He, \u201cthat thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee on the mount.\u201d", "6": "But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.", "7": "For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.", "8": "For finding fault with them, He saith, \u201cBehold, the days come,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201cwhen I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah\u2014", "9": "not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they continued not in My covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.", "10": "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people.", "11": "And they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all shall know Me, from the least to the greatest.", "12": "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.\u201d", "13": "In that He saith \u201ca new covenant,\u201d He hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away."}

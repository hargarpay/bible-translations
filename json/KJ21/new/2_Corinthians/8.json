{"1": "Moreover, brethren, we want you to know of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:", "2": "how in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.", "3": "For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing to give of themselves,", "4": "praying us with earnest entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of ministering to the saints.", "5": "And this they did, not as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and unto us by the will of God,", "6": "insomuch that we urged Titus that, as he had begun, so he would finish in you the same grace also.", "7": "Therefore as ye abound in everything \u2014 in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us \u2014 see that ye abound in this grace also.", "8": "I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forthcoming of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.", "9": "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.", "10": "And herein I give my advice, for this is expedient for you, who began earlier not only to do, but also to be in the forefront a year ago.", "11": "Now therefore perform the doing of it, that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.", "12": "For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.", "13": "For I do not mean that other men should be eased and ye burdened,", "14": "but that there be an equality: that now at this time your abundance may supply their want, that their abundance may also supply your want, that there may be equality.", "15": "As it is written: \u201cHe that had gathered much had nothing left over, and he that had gathered little had no lack.\u201d", "16": "But thanks be to God who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.", "17": "For indeed he accepted the exhortation, but being even more zealous, of his own accord he went unto you.", "18": "And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the churches.", "19": "And not that only, but he was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to declare your ready mind.", "20": "For we are avoiding having any man blame us in this abundance which is administered by us,", "21": "providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.", "22": "And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent because of the great confidence which I have in you.", "23": "If any should inquire about Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you. Or if our brethren be inquired about, they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of Christ.", "24": "Therefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf."}

{"1": "It is doubtless not expedient for me to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:", "2": "I knew a man in Christ more than fourteen years ago (whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell \u2014 God knoweth). Such a one was caught up to the third Heaven.", "3": "And I knew such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell \u2014 God knoweth),", "4": "and how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter.", "5": "Of such a one will I glory, yet of myself I will not glory, except in mine infirmities.", "6": "For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool, for I will say the truth. But now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or than he heareth of me.", "7": "And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.", "8": "For this thing, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.", "9": "And He said unto me, \u201cMy grace is sufficent for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\u201d Most gladly therefore will I glory rather in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.", "10": "Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in privations, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then am I strong.", "11": "I have become a fool in glorying. Ye have compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you. For in nothing am I inferior to the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.", "12": "Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.", "13": "For in what are ye inferior to other churches, unless it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!", "14": "Behold, for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.", "15": "And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.", "16": "But be it so, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.", "17": "Did I gain from you by any of those whom I sent unto you?", "18": "I desired Titus to go, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make any gain from you? Walked we not in the same spirit? Walked we not in the same steps?", "19": "Again, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.", "20": "For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you as ye would not, lest there be debates, envyings, wrath, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, boastings, tumults;", "21": "and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."}

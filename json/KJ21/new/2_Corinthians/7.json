{"1": "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.", "2": "Receive us: we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.", "3": "I speak this not to condemn you, for I have said before that ye are in our hearts, to die and live with you.", "4": "Great is my boldness of speech toward you; great is my glorying of you. I am filled with comfort; I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.", "5": "For when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side: without were fightings, within were fears.", "6": "Nevertheless God, who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;", "7": "and not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me, so that I rejoiced the more.", "8": "For though I caused you sorrow with a letter, I do not now repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that the same epistle hath caused you sorrow, though it were but for a season.", "9": "Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorrowful, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For ye were made sorrowful in a godly manner, that ye might receive injury from us in nothing.", "10": "For godly sorrow is not to be repented of, but worketh repentance unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.", "11": "For behold this selfsame thing, when ye sorrowed in a godly manner: what earnest concern it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what requital! In all these things ye have proved yourselves to be clear in this matter.", "12": "Therefore, though I wrote unto you, I did not do so for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for his sake who suffered wrong, but that our concern for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.", "13": "Therefore we were comforted in your comfort. Yea, we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.", "14": "For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I am not ashamed, but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found to be true.", "15": "And his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.", "16": "I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things."}

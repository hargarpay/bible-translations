Do not rich men oppress you and drag you before the judgment seats?", "7": "Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called?", "8": "If ye fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,\u201d ye do well.", "9": "But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.", "10": "For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend on one point, he is guilty of all.", "11": "For He that said, \u201cDo not commit adultery,\u201d said also, \u201cDo not kill.\u201d Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.", "12": "So speak ye, and so do, as those who shall be judged by the law of liberty.", "13": "For he shall have judgment without mercy, who hath shown no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.", "14": "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and hath not works?

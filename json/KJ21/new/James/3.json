If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body.", "3": "Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.", "4": "Behold also the ships, which though they be so great and are driven by fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the helmsman pleases.", "5": "Even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a wood a little fire kindleth!", "6": "And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. So is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire from hell.", "7": "For every kind of beast and bird and serpent and thing in the sea is tamed, and hath been tamed, by mankind.", "8": "But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.", "9": "Therewith we bless God, even the Father, and therewith we curse men, who are made in the similitude of God.", "10": "Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.

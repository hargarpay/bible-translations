{"1": "In those days, the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples unto Him and said unto them,", "2": "\u201cI have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.", "3": "And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way; for divers of them came from afar.\u201d", "4": "And His disciples answered Him, \u201cFrom whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?\u201d", "5": "And He asked them, \u201cHow many loaves have ye?\u201d And they said, \u201cSeven.\u201d", "6": "And He commanded the people to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks and broke, and gave to His disciples to set before them; and they set them before the people.", "7": "And they had a few small fishes, and He blessed them and commanded to set them also before them.", "8": "So they ate and were filled; and they took up of the broken meat that was left, seven baskets.", "9": "And those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away.", "10": "And straightway He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.", "11": "And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with Him, seeking from Him a sign from Heaven, testing Him.", "12": "And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said, \u201cWhy doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say unto you, there shall no sign be given unto this generation.\u201d", "13": "And He left them and, entering into the boat again, departed to the other side.", "14": "Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf.", "15": "And He charged them, saying, \u201cTake heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.\u201d", "16": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \u201cIt is because we have no bread.\u201d", "17": "And when Jesus knew it, He said unto them, \u201cWhy reason ye, because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive, nor understand? Have ye your heart yet hardened?", "18": "Having eyes, see ye not? And having ears, hear ye not? And do ye not remember?", "19": "When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?\u201d They said unto Him, \u201cTwelve.\u201d", "20": "\u201cAnd when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?\u201d And they said, \u201cSeven.\u201d", "21": "And He said unto them, \u201cHow is it that ye do not understand?\u201d", "22": "And He came to Bethsaida, and they brought a blind man unto Him, and besought Him to touch him.", "23": "And He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him, He asked him if he saw anything.", "24": "And he looked up and said, \u201cI see men as trees, walking.\u201d", "25": "After that He put His hands again upon his eyes and made him look up; and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.", "26": "And He sent him away to his house, saying, \u201cNeither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.\u201d", "27": "And Jesus went out with His disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples, saying unto them, \u201cWho do men say that I am?\u201d", "28": "And they answered, \u201cJohn the Baptist; but some say Elijah, and others, one of the prophets.\u201d", "29": "And He said unto them, \u201cBut whom say ye that I am?\u201d And Peter answered and said unto Him, \u201cThou art the Christ.\u201d", "30": "And He charged them that they should tell no man of Him.", "31": "And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and by the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.", "32": "And He spoke that saying openly. And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him.", "33": "But when He had turned about and looked on His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, \u201cGet thee behind Me, Satan; for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.\u201d", "34": "And when He had called the people unto Him with His disciples also, He said unto them, \u201cWhosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.", "35": "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for My sake and the Gospel's, the same shall save it.", "36": "For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?", "37": "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?", "38": "Whosoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d"}

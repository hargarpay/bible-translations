I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?", "4": "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.", "5": "I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.", "6": "I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone.

This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.\u201d"}

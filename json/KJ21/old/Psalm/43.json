{"1": "Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.", "2": "For Thou art the God of my strength; why dost Thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?", "3": "O send out Thy light and Thy truth! Let them lead me. Let them bring me unto Thy holy hill and to Thy tabernacles.", "4": "Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy; yea, upon the harp will I praise Thee, O God, my God.", "5": "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance and my God."}

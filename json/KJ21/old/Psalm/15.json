{"1": "Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in Thy holy hill?", "2": "He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart;", "3": "he that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor spreadeth a reproach against his neighbor;", "4": "in whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoreth them that fear the Lord; he that taketh an oath to his own hurt, and changeth not;", "5": "he that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh a bribe against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved."}

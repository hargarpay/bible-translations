{"1": "Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,", "2": "\u201cArise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.\u201d", "3": "But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.", "4": "But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was likely to be broken.", "5": "Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner parts of the ship, and he lay and was fast asleep.", "6": "So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him, \u201cWhat meanest thou, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if it so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.\u201d", "7": "And they said every one to his fellow, \u201cCome, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.\u201d So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.", "8": "Then said they unto him, \u201cTell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: What is thine occupation? And from whence comest thou? What is thy country? And of what people art thou?\u201d", "9": "And he said unto them, \u201cI am a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.\u201d", "10": "Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, \u201cWhy hast thou done this?\u201d For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.", "11": "Then said they unto him, \u201cWhat shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?\u201d For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.", "12": "And he said unto them, \u201cTake me up and cast me forth into the sea. So shall the sea be calm unto you, for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.\u201d", "13": "Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not, for the sea was wroughtup and was tempestuous against them.", "14": "Therefore they cried unto the Lord and said, \u201cWe beseech Thee, O Lord, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood! For Thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased Thee.\u201d", "15": "So they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea, and the sea ceased from her raging.", "16": "Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows.", "17": "Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."}

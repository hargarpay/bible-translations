{"1": "The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all who were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive unto Babylon.", "2": "And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said unto him, \u201cThe Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.", "3": "Now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as He hath said: because ye have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you.", "4": "And now behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well after thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear. Behold, all the land is before thee. Wherever it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.\u201d", "5": "Now while he had not yet gone back, he said, \u201cGo back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go.\u201d So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go.", "6": "Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.", "7": "Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men and women and children, and the poor of the land of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon,", "8": "then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah \u2014 even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.", "9": "And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore unto them and to their men, saying, \u201cFear not to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.", "10": "As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, who will come unto us; but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.\u201d", "11": "Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the Ammonites and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,", "12": "even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.", "13": "Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah", "14": "and said unto him, \u201cDost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee?\u201d But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.", "15": "Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, \u201cLet me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it. Why should he slay thee, that all the Jews who are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in Judah perish?\u201d", "16": "But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, \u201cThou shalt not do this thing, for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.\u201d"}

{"1": "Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.", "2": "Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the High Gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the Lord.", "3": "And it came to pass on the morrow that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, \u201cThe Lord hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magormissabib [that is, Fear round about].", "4": "For thus saith the Lord: 'Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon and shall slay them with the sword.", "5": "Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labors thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall despoil them and take them and carry them to Babylon.", "6": "And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there, thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies.'\u201d", "7": "O Lord, Thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed. I am in derision daily; every one mocketh me.", "8": "For when I spoke, I cried out; I cried, \u201cViolence and despoliation!\u201d because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily.", "9": "Then I said, \u201cI will not make mention of Him, nor speak any more in His name.\u201d But His word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not hold back.", "10": "For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. \u201cReport,\u201d say they, \u201cand we will report it!\u201d All in my company watched for my halting, saying, \u201cPerhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him; and we shall take our revenge on him.\u201d", "11": "But the Lord is with me as a mighty, fearsome one; therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed, for they shall not prosper; their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.", "12": "But, O Lord of hosts, who triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart, let me see Thy vengeance on them, for unto Thee have I opened my cause.", "13": "Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord; for He hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.", "14": "Cursed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed.", "15": "Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, \u201cA manchild is born unto thee,\u201d making him very glad.", "16": "And let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew, and repented not; and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontide,", "17": "because he slew me not from the womb, or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.", "18": "Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?"}

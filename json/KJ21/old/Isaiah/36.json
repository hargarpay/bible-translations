And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller's Field.", "3": "Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.", "4": "And Rabshakeh said unto them, \u201cSay ye now to Hezekiah, 'Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?", "5": "I say, thou sayest (but they are but vain words), \u201cI have counsel and strength for war.\u201d Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?", "6": "Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, in Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.", "7": "But if thou say to me, \u201cWe trust in the Lord our God,\u201d is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, \u201cYe shall worship before this altar\u201d?", "8": "Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.", "9": "How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?", "10": "And have I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it?

Hath he not sent me to the men who sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?\u201d", "13": "Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, \u201cHear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!", "14": "Thus saith the king: 'Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.", "15": "Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, \u201cThe Lord will surely deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\u201d", "16": "Hearken not to Hezekiah, for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern,", "17": "until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.", "18": "Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, \u201cThe Lord will deliver us.\u201d Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?", "19": "Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad?

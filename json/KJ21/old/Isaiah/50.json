Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.", "2": "Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.", "3": "I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.", "4": "\u201cThe Lord God hath given Me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. He wakeneth morning by morning; He wakeneth Mine ear to hear as the learned.", "5": "The Lord God hath opened Mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.", "6": "I gave My back to the smiters and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not My face from shame and spitting.", "7": "For the Lord God will help Me, therefore shall I not be confounded; therefore have I set My face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.", "8": "He is near that justifieth Me.

Walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have from Mine hand: ye shall lie down in sorrow."}

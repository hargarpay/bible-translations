{"1": "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.", "2": "Above it stood the seraphims; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.", "3": "And one cried unto another and said, \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.\u201d", "4": "And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.", "5": "Then said I, \u201cWoe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\u201d", "6": "Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.", "7": "And he laid it upon my mouth and said, \u201cLo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\u201d", "8": "Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\u201d Then said I, \u201cHere am I. Send me!\u201d", "9": "And He said, \u201cGo, and tell this people: \u201c'Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.'", "10": "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be healed.\u201d", "11": "Then said I, \u201cLord, how long?\u201d And He answered, \u201cUntil the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,", "12": "and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.", "13": "\u201cBut yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and shall be eaten, as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.\u201d"}

But turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.\u201d", "7": "And He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.", "8": "Then said He unto me, \u201cSon of man, dig now in the wall\u201d; and when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door.", "9": "And He said unto me, \u201cGo in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.\u201d", "10": "So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel portrayed upon the wall round about.", "11": "And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.", "12": "Then said He unto me, \u201cSon of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his images? For they say, 'The Lord seeth us not. The Lord hath forsaken the earth.'\u201d", "13": "He said also unto me, \u201cTurn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.\u201d", "14": "Then He brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord'S house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.", "15": "Then said He unto me, \u201cHast thou seen this, O son of man?

Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in Mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.\u201d"}

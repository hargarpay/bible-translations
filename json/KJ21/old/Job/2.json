{"1": "Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.", "2": "And the Lord said unto Satan, \u201cFrom whence comest thou?\u201d And Satan answered the Lord and said, \u201cFrom going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.\u201d", "3": "And the Lord said unto Satan, \u201cHast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who feareth God and escheweth evil? And still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst Me against him to destroy him without cause.\u201d", "4": "And Satan answered the Lord and said, \u201cSkin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.", "5": "But put forth Thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face!\u201d", "6": "And the Lord said unto Satan, \u201cBehold, he is in thine hand; only spare his life.\u201d", "7": "So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.", "8": "And he took him a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat down among the ashes.", "9": "Then said his wife unto him, \u201cDost thou still retain thine integrity?

Do you know how to discern the [c]appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times?", "4": "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a [d]sign; and a [e]sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah.\u201d And He left them and went away.", "5": "And the disciples came to the other side of the sea, but they had forgotten to bring any bread.", "6": "And Jesus said to them, \u201cWatch out and beware of the [f]leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d", "7": "They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, \u201cHe said that because we did not bring any bread.\u201d", "8": "But Jesus, aware of this, said, \u201cYou men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?", "9": "Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full you picked up?", "10": "Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets full you picked up?", "11": "How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the [g]leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d", "12": "Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.", "13": "Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d", "14": "And they said, \u201cSome say John the Baptist; and others, [h]Elijah; but still others, [i]Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.\u201d", "15": "He *said to them, \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d", "16": "Simon Peter answered, \u201cYou are [j]the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d", "17": "And Jesus said to him, \u201cBlessed are you, Simon [k]Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.", "18": "I also say to you that you are [l]Peter, and upon this [m]rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.", "19": "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth [n]shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth [o]shall have been loosed in heaven.\u201d", "20": "Then He [p]warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was [q]the Christ.", "21": "From that time [r]Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.", "22": "Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, \u201c[s]God forbid it, Lord!

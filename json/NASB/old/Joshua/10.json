He left no survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he [t]utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it.", "38": "Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it.", "39": "He captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and [u]utterly destroyed every person who was in it.

He left no survivor, but he [w]utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded.", "41": "Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon.", "42": "Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.", "43": "So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal."}

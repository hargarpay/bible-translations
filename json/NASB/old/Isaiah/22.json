{"1": "The [a]oracle concerning the valley of vision. What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?", "2": "You who were full of noise, You boisterous town, you exultant city; Your slain were not slain with the sword, Nor [b]did they die in battle.", "3": "All your rulers have fled together, And have been captured [c]without the bow; All of you who were found were taken captive together, [d]Though they had fled far away.", "4": "Therefore I say, \u201cTurn your eyes away from me, Let me weep bitterly, Do not [e]try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.\u201d", "5": "For the Lord [f]God of hosts has a day of panic, subjugation and confusion In the valley of vision, A breaking down of walls And a crying [g]to the mountain.", "6": "Elam took up the quiver With the chariots, [h]infantry and horsemen; And Kir uncovered the shield.", "7": "Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots, And the horsemen took up fixed positions at the gate.", "8": "And He removed the [i]defense of Judah. In that day you [j]depended on the weapons of the house of the forest,", "9": "And you saw that the breaches In the wall of the city of David were many; And you collected the waters of the lower pool.", "10": "Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem And tore down houses to fortify the wall.", "11": "And you made a reservoir between the two walls For the waters of the old pool. But you did not [k]depend on Him who made it, Nor did you [l]take into consideration Him who planned it long ago.", "12": "Therefore in that day the Lord [m]God of hosts called you to weeping, to wailing, To shaving the head and to wearing sackcloth.", "13": "Instead, there is gaiety and gladness, Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, Eating of meat and drinking of wine: \u201cLet us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die.\u201d", "14": "But the Lord of hosts revealed Himself [n]to me, \u201cSurely this iniquity shall not be [o]forgiven you Until you die,\u201d says the Lord [p]God of hosts.", "15": "Thus says the Lord [q]God of hosts, \u201cCome, go to this steward, To Shebna, who is in charge of the royal household,", "16": "'What right do you have here, And whom do you have here, That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, You who hew a tomb on the height, You who carve a resting place for [r]yourself in the rock?", "17": "'Behold, the Lord is about to hurl you headlong, O man. And He is about to grasp you firmly", "18": "And roll you tightly like a ball, To be cast into a vast country; There you will die And there your splendid chariots will be, You shame of your master's house.'", "19": "\u201cI will depose you from your office, And [s]I will pull you down from your station.", "20": "\u201cThen it will come about in that day, That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,", "21": "And I will clothe him with your tunic And tie your sash securely about him. I will entrust him with your [t]authority, And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.", "22": "\u201cThen I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder, When he opens no one will shut, When he shuts no one will open.", "23": "\u201cI will drive him like a peg in a firm place, And he will become a throne of glory to his father's house.", "24": "So they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, offspring and [u]issue, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars.", "25": "In that day,\u201d declares the Lord of hosts, \u201cthe peg driven in a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has spoken.\u201d"}

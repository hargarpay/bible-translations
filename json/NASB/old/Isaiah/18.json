{"1": "Alas, oh land of whirring wings Which lies beyond the rivers of [a]Cush,", "2": "Which sends envoys by the sea, Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation [b]tall and smooth, To a people feared [c]far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation Whose land the rivers divide.", "3": "All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth, As soon as a standard is raised on the mountains, you will see it, And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear it.", "4": "For thus the Lord has told me, \u201cI will look [d]from My dwelling place quietly Like dazzling heat in the [e]sunshine, Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.\u201d", "5": "For before the harvest, as soon as the bud [f]blossoms And the flower becomes a ripening grape, Then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knives And remove and cut away the spreading branches.", "6": "They will be left together for mountain birds of prey, And for the beasts of the earth; And the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them, And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them.", "7": "At that time a gift of homage will be brought to the Lord of hosts [g]From a people [h]tall and smooth, Even from a people feared [i]far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation, Whose land the rivers divide\u2014 To the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, even Mount Zion."}

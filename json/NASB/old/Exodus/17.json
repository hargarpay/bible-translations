Why do you test the Lord?\u201d", "3": "But the people thirsted there for water; and [c]they grumbled against Moses and said, \u201cWhy, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill [d]us and [e]our children and [f]our livestock with thirst?\u201d", "4": "So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, \u201cWhat shall I do to this people? A little more and they will stone me.\u201d", "5": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cPass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.", "6": "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.\u201d And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.", "7": "He named the place [g]Massah and [h]Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the Lord, saying, \u201cIs the Lord among us, or not?\u201d", "8": "Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.", "9": "So Moses said to Joshua, \u201cChoose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek.

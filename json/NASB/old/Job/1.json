{"1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.", "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.", "3": "His possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the [a]men of the east.", "4": "His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.", "5": "When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, \u201cPerhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.\u201d Thus Job did continually.", "6": "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and [b]Satan also came among them.", "7": "The Lord said to Satan, \u201cFrom where do you come?\u201d Then Satan answered the Lord and said, \u201cFrom roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.\u201d", "8": "The Lord said to Satan, \u201cHave you [c]considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, [d]fearing God and turning away from evil.\u201d", "9": "Then Satan answered the [e]Lord, \u201cDoes Job fear God for nothing?", "10": "Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.", "11": "But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face.\u201d", "12": "Then the Lord said to Satan, \u201cBehold, all that he has is in your [f]power, only do not put forth your hand on him.\u201d So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.", "13": "Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,", "14": "a messenger came to Job and said, \u201cThe oxen were plowing and the [g]donkeys feeding beside them,", "15": "and [h]the Sabeans [i]attacked and took them.

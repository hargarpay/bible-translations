Has anything like this happened in your days Or in your fathers' days?", "3": "Tell your sons about it, And let your sons tell their sons, And their sons the next generation.", "4": "What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten; And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.", "5": "Awake, drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you wine drinkers, On account of the sweet wine That is cut off from your mouth.", "6": "For a nation has [a]invaded my land, Mighty and without number; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it has the fangs of a lioness.", "7": "It has made my vine a waste And my fig tree [b]splinters. It has stripped them bare and cast them away; Their branches have become white.", "8": "Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the bridegroom of her youth.", "9": "The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off From the house of the Lord. The priests mourn, The ministers of the Lord.", "10": "The field is ruined, The land mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine dries up, Fresh oil [c]fails.", "11": "[d]Be ashamed, O farmers, Wail, O vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field is destroyed.", "12": "The vine dries up And the fig tree [e]fails; The pomegranate, the palm also, and the [f]apple tree, All the trees of the field dry up.

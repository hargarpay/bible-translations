{"1": "When I would heal Israel, The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they deal falsely; The thief enters in, Bandits raid outside,", "2": "And they do not [a]consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds are all around them; They are before My face.", "3": "With their wickedness they make the king glad, And the princes with their lies.", "4": "They are all adulterers, Like an oven heated by the baker Who ceases to stir up the fire From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.", "5": "On the [b]day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers,", "6": "For their hearts are like an oven As they approach their [c]plotting; Their [d]anger [e]smolders all night, In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.", "7": "All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me.", "8": "Ephraim mixes himself with the [f]nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned.", "9": "Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know it; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know it.", "10": "Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have not returned to the Lord their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all this.", "11": "So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without [g]sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.", "12": "When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance with the [h]proclamation to their assembly.", "13": "Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me.", "14": "And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they [i]assemble themselves, They turn away from Me.", "15": "Although I trained and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me.", "16": "They turn, but not [j]upward, They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the [k]insolence of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt."}

{"1": "Israel is a [a]luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The [b]richer his land, The better [c]he made the sacred pillars.", "2": "Their heart is [d]faithless; Now they must bear their guilt. [e]The Lord will break down their altars And destroy their sacred pillars.", "3": "Surely now they will say, \u201cWe have no king, For we do not revere the Lord. As for the king, what can he do for us?\u201d", "4": "They speak mere words, [f]With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.", "5": "The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the [g]calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests [h]will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has departed from it.", "6": "The thing itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to [i]King Jareb; Ephraim will [j]be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel.", "7": "Samaria will be cut off with her king Like a stick on the surface of the water.", "8": "Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars; Then they will say to the mountains, \u201cCover us!\u201d And to the hills, \u201cFall on us!\u201d", "9": "From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; There they stand! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah?", "10": "When it is My desire, I will [k]chastise them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt.", "11": "Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, But I will come over her fair neck with a yoke; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself.", "12": "Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with [l]kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the Lord Until He comes to [m]rain righteousness on you.", "13": "You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors,", "14": "Therefore a tumult will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.", "15": "Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off."}

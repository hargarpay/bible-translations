You have loved harlots' earnings on [d]every threshing floor.", "2": "Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail [e]them.", "3": "They will not remain in the Lord's land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean food.", "4": "They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the Lord, Their sacrifices will not please Him. Their bread will [f]be like [g]mourners' bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for [h]themselves alone; It will not enter the house of the Lord.", "5": "What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the Lord?", "6": "For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns will be in their tents.", "7": "The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; [i]Let Israel know this! The prophet is a fool, The [j]inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And because your hostility is so great.", "8": "Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a prophet; Yet the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, And there is only hostility in the house of his God.", "9": "They have gone deep [k]in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.", "10": "I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season.

Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them!", "13": "Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.", "14": "Give them, O Lord\u2014what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.", "15": "All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels.", "16": "Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb.", "17": "My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations."}

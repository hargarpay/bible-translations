{"1": "How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion With a cloud in His anger! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His footstool In the day of His anger.", "2": "The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared All the habitations of Jacob. In His wrath He has thrown down The strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.", "3": "In fierce anger He has cut off [a]All the strength of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire Consuming round about.", "4": "He has bent His bow like an enemy; He has set His right hand like an adversary And slain all that were pleasant to the eye; In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.", "5": "The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all its palaces, He has destroyed its strongholds And multiplied in the daughter of Judah Mourning and moaning.", "6": "And He has violently treated His [b]tabernacle like a garden booth; He has destroyed His appointed [c]meeting place. The Lord has caused to be forgotten The appointed feast and sabbath in Zion, And He has despised king and priest In the indignation of His anger.", "7": "The Lord has rejected His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has delivered into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces. They have made a noise in the house of the Lord As in the day of an appointed feast.", "8": "The Lord [d]determined to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line, He has not restrained His hand from [e]destroying, And He has caused rampart and wall to lament; They have languished together.", "9": "Her gates have sunk into the ground, He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The law is no more. Also, her prophets find No vision from the Lord.", "10": "The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground, they are silent. They have thrown dust on their heads; They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Have bowed their heads to the ground.", "11": "My eyes fail because of tears, My [f]spirit is greatly troubled; My [g]heart is poured out on the earth Because of the [h]destruction of the daughter of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city.", "12": "They say to their mothers, \u201cWhere is grain and wine?\u201d As they faint like a wounded man In the streets of the city, As their life is poured out On their mothers' bosom.", "13": "How shall I admonish you? To what shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I liken you as I comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your [i]ruin is as vast as the sea; Who can heal you?", "14": "Your prophets have seen for you False and foolish visions; And they have not exposed your iniquity So as to restore you from captivity, But they have seen for you false and misleading [j]oracles.", "15": "All who pass along the way Clap their hands in derision at you; They hiss and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem, \u201cIs this the city of which they said, 'The perfection of beauty, A joy to all the earth'?\u201d", "16": "All your enemies Have opened their mouths wide against you; They hiss and gnash their teeth. They say, \u201cWe have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day for which we waited; We have reached it, we have seen it.\u201d", "17": "The Lord has done what He purposed; He has accomplished His word Which He commanded from days of old. He has thrown down without sparing, And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the [k]might of your adversaries.", "18": "Their heart cried out to the Lord, \u201cO wall of the daughter of Zion, Let your tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no relief, Let [l]your eyes have no rest.", "19": "\u201cArise, cry aloud in the night At the beginning of the night watches; Pour out your heart like water Before the presence of the Lord; Lift up your hands to Him For the life of your little ones Who are faint because of hunger At the head of every street.\u201d", "20": "See, O Lord, and look! With whom have You dealt thus? Should women eat their [m]offspring, The little ones who were [n]born healthy? Should priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord?", "21": "On the ground in the streets Lie young and old; My virgins and my young men Have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of Your anger, You have slaughtered, not sparing.", "22": "You called as in the day of an appointed feast My terrors on every side; And there was no one who escaped or survived In the day of the Lord's anger. Those whom I [o]bore and reared, My enemy annihilated them."}

I cry out to You, \u201cViolence!\u201d Yet You do not save.", "3": "Why do You make me see iniquity, And cause me to look on wickedness? Yes, destruction and violence are before me; Strife exists and contention arises.", "4": "Therefore the law is [b]ignored And justice [c]is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore justice comes out perverted.", "5": "\u201cLook among the nations! Observe! Be astonished! Wonder! Because I am doing something in your days\u2014 You would not believe if [d]you were told.", "6": "\u201cFor behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, That [e]fierce and impetuous people Who march [f]throughout the earth To [g]seize dwelling places which are not theirs.", "7": "\u201cThey are dreaded and feared; Their justice and [h]authority [i]originate with themselves.", "8": "\u201cTheir horses are swifter than leopards And [j]keener than wolves in the evening.

Why do You look with favor On those who deal treacherously? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they?", "14": "Why have You made men like the fish of the sea, Like creeping things without a ruler over them?", "15": "The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net.

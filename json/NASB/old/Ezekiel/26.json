I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste,'", "3": "therefore thus says the Lord [b]God, 'Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.", "4": "They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock.", "5": "She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,' declares the Lord God, 'and she will become spoil for the nations.", "6": "Also her daughters who are [c]on the mainland will be slain by the sword, and they will know that I am the Lord.'\u201d", "7": "For thus says the Lord God, \u201cBehold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry and [d]a great army.", "8": "He will slay your daughters [e]on the mainland with the sword; and he will make siege walls against you, cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you.", "9": "The blow of his battering rams he will direct against your walls, and with his [f]axes he will break down your towers.", "10": "Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust raised by them will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of cavalry and [g]wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city that is breached.", "11": "With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will slay your people with the sword; and your strong pillars will come down to the ground.", "12": "Also they will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise, break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and [h]throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water.", "13": "So I will [i]silence the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.", "14": "I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets.

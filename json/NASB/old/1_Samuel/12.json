And I have walked before you from my youth even to this day.", "3": "Here I am; bear witness against me before the Lord and His anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? I will restore it to you.\u201d", "4": "They said, \u201cYou have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand.\u201d", "5": "He said to them, \u201cThe Lord is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing in my hand.\u201d And they said, \u201cHe is witness.\u201d", "6": "Then Samuel said to the people, \u201cIt is the Lord who [b]appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.", "7": "So now, take your stand, that I may plead with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord which He did for you and your fathers.", "8": "When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the Lord, then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron [c]who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.", "9": "But they forgot the Lord their God, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.", "10": "They cried out to the Lord and said, 'We have sinned because we have forsaken the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.'", "11": "Then the Lord sent Jerubbaal and [d]Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security.", "12": "When you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' although the Lord your God was your king.", "13": "Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the Lord has set a king over you.", "14": "If you will fear the Lord and serve Him, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the [e]command of the Lord, then both you and also the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God.", "15": "If you will not listen to the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the [f]command of the Lord, then the hand of the Lord will be against you, as it was against your fathers.", "16": "Even now, take your stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes.", "17": "Is it not the wheat harvest today?

And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel", "3": "(now the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. And the woman was [b]intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings, and he was a Calebite),", "4": "that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.", "5": "So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, \u201cGo up to Carmel, [c]visit Nabal and greet him in my name;", "6": "and thus you shall say, '[d]Have a long life, peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.", "7": "Now I have heard that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us and we have not insulted them, nor have they missed anything all the days they were in Carmel.", "8": "Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a [e]festive day.

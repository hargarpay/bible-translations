Give [b]me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.\u201d", "4": "The priest answered David and said, \u201cThere is no ordinary bread [c]on hand, but there is consecrated bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.\u201d", "5": "David answered the priest and said to him, \u201cSurely women have been kept from us as previously when I set out and the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then today will [d]their vessels be holy?\u201d", "6": "So the priest gave him consecrated bread; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence which was removed from before the Lord, in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away.", "7": "Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.", "8": "David said to Ahimelech, \u201cNow is there not a spear or a sword [e]on hand?

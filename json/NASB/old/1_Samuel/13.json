But he sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent.", "3": "Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, \u201cLet the Hebrews hear.\u201d", "4": "All Israel heard [c]the news that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. The people were then summoned [d]to Saul at Gilgal.", "5": "Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.", "6": "When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in cliffs, in cellars, and in pits.", "7": "Also some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead.

So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.\u201d", "13": "Samuel said to Saul, \u201cYou have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which He commanded you, for now the Lord would have established your kingdom [f]over Israel forever.", "14": "But now your kingdom shall not endure. The Lord has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.\u201d", "15": "Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.

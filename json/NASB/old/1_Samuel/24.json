Indeed, see the edge of your robe in my hand!

May the Lord therefore reward you with good in return for what you have done to me this day.", "20": "Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.", "21": "So now swear to me by the Lord that you will not cut off my [l]descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father's household.\u201d", "22": "David swore to Saul.

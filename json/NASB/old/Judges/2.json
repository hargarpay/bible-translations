But you have not [a]obeyed Me; what is this you have done?", "3": "Therefore I also said, 'I will not drive them out before you; but they will [b]become as thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.'\u201d", "4": "When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.", "5": "So they named that place [c]Bochim; and there they sacrificed to the Lord.", "6": "When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land.", "7": "The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who [d]survived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Lord which He had done for Israel.", "8": "Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred and ten.", "9": "And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.", "10": "All that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord, nor yet the work which He had done for Israel.", "11": "Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and [e]served the Baals,", "12": "and they forsook the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; thus they provoked the Lord to anger.", "13": "So they forsook the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.", "14": "The anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.", "15": "Wherever they went, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had spoken and as the Lord had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.", "16": "Then the Lord raised up judges [f]who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them.", "17": "Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them.

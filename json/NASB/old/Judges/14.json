Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.", "5": "Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.", "6": "The Spirit of the Lord [f]came upon him mightily, so that he tore him as one tears a young goat though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.", "7": "So he went down and talked to the woman; and she [g]looked good to Samson.", "8": "When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion.", "9": "So he scraped [h]the honey into his [i]hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it; but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion.", "10": "Then his father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men customarily did this.", "11": "When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.", "12": "Then Samson said to them, \u201cLet me now propound a riddle to you; if you will indeed tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes.", "13": "But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes.\u201d And they said to him, \u201cPropound your riddle, that we may hear it.\u201d", "14": "So he said to them, \u201cOut of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet.\u201d But they could not tell the riddle in three days.", "15": "Then it came about on the [j]fourth day that they said to Samson's wife, \u201cEntice your husband, so that he will tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us? Is this not so?\u201d", "16": "Samson's wife wept before him and said, \u201cYou only hate me, and you do not love me; you have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told it to me.\u201d And he said to her, \u201cBehold, I have not told it to my father or mother; so should I tell you?\u201d", "17": "However she wept before him seven days while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the sons of her people.", "18": "So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, \u201cWhat is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?\u201d And he said to them, \u201cIf you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have found out my riddle.\u201d", "19": "Then the Spirit of the Lord [k]came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their spoil and gave the changes of clothes to those who told the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father's house.", "20": "But Samson's wife was given to his companion who had been his [l]friend."}

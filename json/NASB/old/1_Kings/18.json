{"1": "Now it happened after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, \u201cGo, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth.\u201d", "2": "So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.", "3": "Ahab called Obadiah who was over the household. (Now Obadiah [a]feared the Lord greatly;", "4": "for when Jezebel [b]destroyed the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)", "5": "Then Ahab said to Obadiah, \u201cGo through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not [c]have to kill some of the cattle.\u201d", "6": "So they divided the land between them to [d]survey it; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself.", "7": "Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah [e]met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, \u201cIs this you, Elijah my master?\u201d", "8": "He said to him, \u201cIt is I. Go, say to your master, 'Behold, Elijah is here.'\u201d", "9": "He said, \u201cWhat [f]sin have I committed, that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to put me to death?", "10": "As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you; and when they said, 'He is not here,' he made the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you.", "11": "And now you are saying, 'Go, say to your master, \u201cBehold, Elijah is here.\u201d'", "12": "It will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the Lord will carry you where I do not know; so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have [g]feared the Lord from my youth.", "13": "Has it not been told to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, that I hid [h]a hundred prophets of the Lord by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water?", "14": "And now you are saying, 'Go, say to your master, \u201cBehold, Elijah is here\u201d'; he will then kill me.\u201d", "15": "Elijah said, \u201cAs the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.\u201d", "16": "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.", "17": "When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, \u201cIs this you, you troubler of Israel?\u201d", "18": "He said, \u201cI have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house have, because you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and you have followed the Baals.", "19": "Now then send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, together with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\u201d", "20": "So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.", "21": "Elijah came near to all the people and said, \u201cHow long will you [i]hesitate between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.\u201d But the people did not answer him a word.", "22": "Then Elijah said to the people, \u201cI alone am left a prophet of the Lord, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.", "23": "Now let them give us two oxen; and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood, and I will not put a fire under it.", "24": "Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord, and the God who answers by fire, He is God.\u201d And all the people said, \u201c[j]That is a good idea.\u201d", "25": "So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \u201cChoose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.\u201d", "26": "Then they took the ox which [k]was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying, \u201cO Baal, answer us.\u201d But there was no voice and no one answered. And they [l]leaped about the altar which [m]they made.", "27": "It came about at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, \u201cCall out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied or gone aside, or is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened.\u201d", "28": "So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them.", "29": "When midday was past, they [n]raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and no [o]one paid attention.", "30": "Then Elijah said to all the people, \u201cCome near to me.\u201d So all the people came near to him.

And he said, \u201cDo it a third time,\u201d and they did it a third time.", "35": "The water flowed around the altar and he also filled the trench with water.", "36": "At the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, \u201cO Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and I have done all these things at Your word.", "37": "Answer me, O Lord, answer me, that this people may know that You, O Lord, are God, and that You have turned their heart back again.\u201d", "38": "Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.", "39": "When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, \u201cThe Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God.\u201d", "40": "Then Elijah said to them, \u201cSeize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.\u201d So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.", "41": "Now Elijah said to Ahab, \u201cGo up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower.\u201d", "42": "So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he crouched down on the earth and put his face between his knees.", "43": "He said to his servant, \u201cGo up now, look toward the sea.\u201d So he went up and looked and said, \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d And he said, \u201cGo back\u201d seven times.", "44": "It came about at the seventh time, that he said, \u201cBehold, a cloud as small as a man's hand is coming up from the sea.\u201d And he said, \u201cGo up, say to Ahab, '[q]Prepare your chariot and go down, so that the heavy shower does not stop you.'\u201d", "45": "In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.", "46": "Then the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and [r]outran Ahab [s]to Jezreel."}

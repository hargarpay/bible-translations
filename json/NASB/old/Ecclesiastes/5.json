{"1": "[a]Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil.", "2": "[b]Do not be hasty [c]in word or [d]impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.", "3": "For the dream comes through much [e]effort and the voice of a fool through many words.", "4": "When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!", "5": "It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.", "6": "Do not let your [f]speech cause [g]you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?", "7": "For in many dreams and in many words there is [h]emptiness. Rather, [i]fear God.", "8": "If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the [j]sight; for one [k]official watches over another [l]official, and there are higher [m]officials over them.", "9": "After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.", "10": "He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income. This too is [n]vanity.", "11": "When good things increase, those who consume them increase.

He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand.", "16": "This also is a grievous evil\u2014exactly as a man [t]is born, thus will he [u]die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?", "17": "Throughout his life he also eats in darkness with great vexation, sickness and anger.", "18": "Here is what I have seen to be good and [v]fitting: to eat, to drink and [w]enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he toils under the sun during the few [x]years of his life which God has given him; for this is his [y]reward.", "19": "Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his [z]reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.", "20": "For he will not often [aa]consider the [ab]years of his life, because God keeps [ac]him occupied with the gladness of his heart."}

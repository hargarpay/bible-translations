And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.", "2": "So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living.", "3": "But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.", "4": "I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor.

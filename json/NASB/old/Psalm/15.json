Who may dwell on Your holy hill?", "2": "He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.", "3": "He does not slander [b]with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;", "4": "In [c]whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But [d]who honors those who fear the Lord; He swears to his own hurt and does not change;", "5": "He does not put out his money [e]at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken."}

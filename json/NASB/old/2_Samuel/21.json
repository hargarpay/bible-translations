And the Lord said, \u201cIt is for Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.\u201d", "2": "So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel [a]made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to [b]kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah).", "3": "Thus David said to the Gibeonites, \u201cWhat should I do for you? And how can I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?\u201d", "4": "Then the Gibeonites said to him, \u201cWe have no concern of silver or gold with Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.\u201d And he said, \u201cI will do for you whatever you say.\u201d", "5": "So they said to the king, \u201cThe man who consumed us and who planned [c]to exterminate us from remaining within any border of Israel,", "6": "let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will [d]hang them before the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the Lord.\u201d And the king said, \u201cI will give them.\u201d", "7": "But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord which was between them, between David and Saul's son Jonathan.", "8": "So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and Mephibosheth whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of [e]Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.", "9": "Then he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they [f]hanged them in the mountain before the Lord, so that the seven of them fell together; and they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the beginning of barley harvest.", "10": "And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until [g]it rained on them from the sky; and she [h]allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.", "11": "When it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,", "12": "then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck down Saul in Gilboa.", "13": "He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been [i]hanged.", "14": "They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; thus they did all that the king commanded, and after that God was moved by prayer for the land.", "15": "Now when the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David went down and his servants with him; and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary.", "16": "Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the [j]giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, [k]was girded with a new sword, and he [l]intended to kill David.", "17": "But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him.

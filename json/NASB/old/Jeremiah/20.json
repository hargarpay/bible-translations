So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.", "5": "I will also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them to Babylon.", "6": "And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.'\u201d", "7": "O Lord, You have deceived me and I was deceived; You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me.", "8": "For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the Lord has [b]resulted In reproach and derision all day long.", "9": "But if I say, \u201cI will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name,\u201d Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding it in, And I cannot endure it.", "10": "For I have heard the whispering of many, \u201cTerror on every side!

Has He not spoken through us as well?\u201d And the Lord heard it.", "3": "(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.)", "4": "Suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, \u201cYou three come out to the tent of meeting.\u201d So the three of them came out.", "5": "Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and He called [a]Aaron and Miriam.

{"1": "Jesus told his disciples: 'There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. ", "2": "So he called him in and asked him, \u201cWhat is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.\u201d", "3": "'The manager said to himself, \u201cWhat shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg\u00a0\u2013  ", "4": "I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.\u201d", "5": "'So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, \u201cHow much do you owe my master?\u201d", "6": "'\u201cThree thousand litres of olive oil,\u201d he replied. 'The manager told him, \u201cTake your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifteen hundred.\u201d", "7": "'Then he asked the second, \u201cAnd how much do you owe?\u201d '\u201cThirty tons of wheat,\u201d he replied.

For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. ", "9": "I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.", "10": "'Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.

", "15": "He said to them, 'You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.", "16": "'The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John.

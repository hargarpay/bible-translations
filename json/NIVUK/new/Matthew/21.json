Untie them and bring them to me. ", "3": "If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.'", "4": "This took place to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet:", "5": "'Say to Daughter Zion, \u201cSee, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\u201d'[a]", "6": "The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. ", "7": "They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. ", "8": "A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.

'Yes,' replied Jesus, 'have you never read, '\u201cFrom the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise\u201d[g]?'", "17": "And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.", "18": "Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.

He answered, \u201cI will, sir,\u201d but he did not go.", "31": "'Which of the two did what his father wanted?' 'The first,' they answered. Jesus said to them, 'Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.

And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.", "33": "'Listen to another parable: there was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall round it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.

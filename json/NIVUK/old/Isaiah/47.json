Lift up your skirts, bare your legs, and wade through the streams.", "3": "Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one.'", "4": "Our Redeemer\u00a0\u2013 the Lord Almighty is his name\u00a0\u2013 is the Holy One of Israel.", "5": "'Sit in silence, go into darkness, queen city of the Babylonians; no more will you be called queen of kingdoms.", "6": "I was angry with my people and desecrated my inheritance; I gave them into your hand, and you showed them no mercy. Even on the aged you laid a very heavy yoke.", "7": "You said, \u201cI am for ever\u00a0\u2013 the eternal queen!\u201d But you did not consider these things or reflect on what might happen.", "8": "'Now then, listen, you lover of pleasure, lounging in your security and saying to yourself, \u201cI am, and there is none besides me.

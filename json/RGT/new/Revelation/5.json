Behold, the Lion Which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, and can open the Book, and loosen the seven seals thereof.\u201d", "6": "Then I beheld. And lo, in the midst of the throne - and of the four beasts - and in the midst of the elders stood a Lamb, as though He had been killed; Which had seven horns and seven eyes (which are the seven spirits of God, sent into all the world).", "7": "And He came and took the Book out of the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne.", "8": "And when He had taken the Book, the four beasts and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb, everyone having harps and golden vials full of odors (which are the prayers of the saints).", "9": "And they sang a new song, saying, \u201cYou are worthy to take the Book and to open the seals thereof!

And lo, a Lamb stood on mount Zion; and with him 144,000, having his Father's Name written in their foreheads.", "2": "And I heard a voice from Heaven, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of harpists, harping with their harps.", "3": "And they sang (as it were) a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts and the elders. And no one could learn that song except the 144,000 who were bought from the earth.", "4": "These are those who are not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These are bought from men, being the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.", "5": "And in their mouths was found no deceit. For they are without spot before the throne of God.", "6": "Then I saw another angel fly in the midst of Heaven - having an everlasting Gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people -", "7": "saying with a loud voice, \u201cFear God! And give glory to Him! For the hour of His judgment has come! And worship Him who made Heaven and Earth and the sea and the fountains of waters!\u201d", "8": "And there followed another angel, saying, \u201cBabylon, that great city is fallen! It is fallen! For she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication!\u201d", "9": "And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, \u201cIf anyone worship the beast and his image - and receives his mark on his forehead, or on his hand -", "10": "the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God; indeed, of the pure wine which is poured into the cup of His wrath! And he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels, and before the Lamb!", "11": "\u201cAnd the smoke of their torment shall ascend evermore! And they shall have no rest, day nor night, who worship the beast and his name!\u201d", "12": "Here is the patience of saints. Here are those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.", "13": "Then I heard a voice from Heaven, saying to me, \u201cWrite: 'The dead who die in the Lord are fully blessed.'\u201d \u201cEven so,\u201d says the Spirit, \u201cfor they rest from their labors and their works still follow them.\u201d", "14": "And I looked. And there was a white cloud. And upon the cloud, One sitting Who looks like the Son of Man; having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.", "15": "And another angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to Him Who sat on the cloud, \u201cThrust in your sickle and reap! For the time has come to reap! For the harvest of the earth is ripe!\u201d", "16": "And He Who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth. And the earth was reaped.", "17": "Then another angel came out of the Temple, which is in Heaven, having also a sharp sickle.", "18": "And another angel came out from the altar - who had power over fire - and cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, and said, \u201cThrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth! For her grapes are ripe!\u201d", "19": "And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle on the earth, and cut down the vines of the vineyard of the earth and cast them into that great winepress of the wrath of God.", "20": "And the winepress was trampled outside the City. And blood flowed out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, for the space of 1600 furlongs."}

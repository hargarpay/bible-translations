And I will show you things which must be done hereafter.\u201d", "2": "And immediately, I was ravished in the Spirit. And behold, a throne was set in Heaven. And One sat upon the throne.", "3": "And He Who sat looked like a jasper stone, and a sardius. And there was a rainbow around the throne, which looked like an emerald.", "4": "And around the throne were 24 seats. And upon the seats I saw 24 elders sitting, clothed in white raiment. And on their heads were crowns of gold.", "5": "And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (which are the seven spirits of God).", "6": "And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four beasts, full of eyes in front and behind.", "7": "And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf. And the third beast had a face as a man. And the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.", "8": "And each of the four beasts had six wings around him. And they were full of eyes within. And they ceased neither day nor night, saying, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty! Who was and Who is and Who is to come!\u201d", "9": "And when those beasts gave glory and honor and thanks to Him Who sat on the throne, Who lives forever and ever,", "10": "the 24 Elders fell down before Him Who sat on the throne and worshipped Him Who lives for evermore; and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,", "11": "\u201cYou are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power! For You have created all things! And for Your will's sake they are and have been created!\u201d"}

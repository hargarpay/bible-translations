{"1": "And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven, clothed with a cloud and the rainbow upon his head. And his face was as the sun; and his feet as pillars of fire.", "2": "And he had in his hand a little book, open. And he put his right foot upon the sea, and his left on the earth,", "3": "and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.", "4": "And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me, \u201cSeal up those things which the seven thunders have spoken, and do not write them.\u201d", "5": "And the angel who I saw stand upon the sea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven,", "6": "And swore by Him Who lives for evermore - Who created Heaven and the things that therein are; and the earth, and the things that therein are; and the sea, and the things that therein are - that time should be no more.", "7": "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel - when he shall begin to blow the trumpet - even the mystery of God shall be finished, as He has declared to His servants, the Prophets.", "8": "And the voice which I heard from Heaven, spoke to me again, and said, \u201cGo, and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth.\u201d", "9": "So I went to the angel, and said to him, \u201cGive me the little book.\u201d And he said to me, \u201cTake it, and eat it up. And it shall make your belly bitter. But it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth.\u201d", "10": "Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth as sweet as honey. But when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.", "11": "And he said to me, \u201cYou must prophesy again among the people and nations and tongues, and to many kings.\u201d"}

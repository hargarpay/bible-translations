I will show you the damnation of the great whore who sits upon many waters;", "2": "with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. And the inhabitants of the earth are drunk with the wine of her fornication.\u201d", "3": "So he carried me away into the wilderness, in the Spirit. And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast - full of names of blasphemy - which had seven heads and ten horns.", "4": "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls; and had a cup of gold in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.", "5": "And on her forehead was a name written: \u201cA Mystery. The great Babylon. The mother of whoredoms and abominations of the earth.\u201d", "6": "And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great marvel.", "7": "Then the angel said to me, \u201cWhy do you marvel? I will show you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that bears her which has seven heads and ten horns.", "8": "The beast that you have seen was and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit; and shall go into perdition.

And the moon was under her feet; and upon her head, a crown of twelve stars.", "2": "And she was with child, and cried and was pained, travailing in birth, ready to be delivered.", "3": "And there appeared another wonder in Heaven: a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads.", "4": "And his tail drew a third of the stars of Heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, to devour her child when she had brought it forth.", "5": "So she brought forth a man child who should rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was taken up to God and to His throne.", "6": "And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that they would feed her there for 1260 days.", "7": "And there was a battle in Heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought, and his angels.", "8": "But they did not prevail, nor was their place found anymore in Heaven.", "9": "And the great dragon was cast out; that old serpent called the devil and Satan, who deceives all the world.

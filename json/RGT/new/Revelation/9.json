{"1": "And the fifth angel blew the trumpet. And I saw a star fall from Heaven to the earth. And to him was given the key to the bottomless pit.", "2": "And he opened the bottomless pit. And there arose the smoke of the pit; the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.", "3": "And there came locusts upon the earth, out of the smoke. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.", "4": "And they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.", "5": "And they were commanded not to kill them; but that they should be tormented for five months, and that their pain should be as the pain that comes from a scorpion when he has stung a man.", "6": "Therefore, in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it; and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them.", "7": "And the appearance of the locusts was like that of horses prepared for battle. And on their heads were something like crowns, like gold. And their faces were like the faces of men.", "8": "And they had hair as the hair of women. And their teeth were as the teeth of lions.", "9": "And they had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots when many horses run into battle.", "10": "And they had tails like scorpions. And there were stings in their tails with power to hurt men for five months.", "11": "And they have a king over them - the angel of the bottomless pit - whose name in Hebrew is 'Abaddon'. And in Greek, he is named 'Apollyon'; that is, 'destroying'.", "12": "One woe is past! And behold, yet two more woes come after this!", "13": "Then the sixth angel blew the trumpet. And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God,", "14": "saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, \u201cRelease the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates!\u201d", "15": "And the four angels who had been appointed an hour a day a month and a year to slay a third of men, were released.", "16": "And the number of horsemen of war were twenty thousand times ten thousand; for I heard the number of them.", "17": "And thus I saw the horses in a vision - and those who sat on them - having fiery breastplates of hyacinth and of brimstone. And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions. And out of their mouths went forth fire and smoke and brimstone.", "18": "By these three was a third of men killed; that is, of the fire and of the smoke and of the brimstone which came out of their mouths.", "19": "For their power is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails were like serpents; and had heads with which they do harm.", "20": "And the remnant of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands (so that they would not worship devils, and idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor go).", "21": "Also they did not repent of their murder, and of their sorcery, nor of their fornication, nor of their theft."}

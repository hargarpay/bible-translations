{"1": "Let as many servants who are under the yoke count their masters worthy of all honor, so that the Name of God and His doctrine are not blasphemed.", "2": "And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them (because they are brothers). But instead serve them, because they are faithful and beloved and partakers of the benefit. Teach and encourage these things.", "3": "If anyone teaches otherwise - and does not consent to the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine according to godliness -", "4": "he is puffed up and knows nothing, but is obsessed with disputing and arguing over words; from which comes envy, strife, coarse language, evil suspicions,", "5": "meaningless disputations of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who think that gain is godliness. Separate yourself from such.", "6": "But godliness is great gain if one is content with what he has.", "7": "For we brought nothing into the world. And it is certain that we can carry nothing out.", "8": "Therefore, when we have food and clothing, let us be content with that.", "9": "For those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and snares, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction.", "10": "For the desire of money is the root of all evil; for which some - while lusting after it - have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.", "11": "But you, O man of God, flee these things! And pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.", "12": "Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.", "13": "I charge you in the sight of God Who quickens all things, and before Jesus Christ Who witnessed a good confession under Pontius Pilate,", "14": "that you keep this commandment spotless and irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Chris;", "15": "which He Who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, shall show in due time.", "16": "He alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, Whom no man ever saw nor can see, and to whom be honor and power everlasting, Amen.", "17": "Charge those who are rich in this world not to be high- minded, and not to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God (Who abundantly gives us all things to enjoy);", "18": "to do good and be rich in good works. And be generous and ready to share,", "19": "laying up in treasure for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, so that they may obtain eternal life.", "20": "O Timothy, keep that which was entrusted to you. And avoid profane and empty babblings and so-called oppositions of \u201cscience\u201d,", "21": "By professing it, some have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen. (The first Epistle to Timothy, written from Laodicea, the chief city of Phrygia Pacatiana)"}

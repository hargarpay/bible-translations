But he is likened to the Son of God and continues as a priest forever.", "4": "Now consider how great this man was to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tithe of the spoils.", "5": "For indeed those who are the children of Levi (who receive the office of the priesthood) have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the Law (that is, from their brothers), though they came out of the loins of Abraham.", "6": "But the one whose family is not counted among them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.", "7": "And without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.", "8": "And here, men who die receive tithes. But there, he who lives (about whom it is witnessed).", "9": "And truth be told, Levi (who receives tithes) also paid tithes to Abraham.", "10": "For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.", "11": "Therefore, if perfection had been by the priesthood of the Levites (for under it the people received the Law) what further need was there for another priest to rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not to be called after the order of Aaron?", "12": "For if the priesthood is changed, then the Law must be changed.", "13": "For He of Whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man served at the altar.", "14": "For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing regarding the priesthood.", "15": "And it is even more evident because there has risen up another priest in the likeness of Melchizedek,", "16": "who is made priest not after the Law of carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.", "17": "For He testifies, \u201cYou are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.\u201d", "18": "For indeed the preceding commandment is annulled because of its weakness and uselessness.", "19": "For the Law made nothing perfect, but rather the introduction of a better hope (by which we draw near to God).", "20": "And inasmuch as it is not without an oath (for these priests are made without an oath,", "21": "but this One was made with an oath by Him Who said to Him, \u201cThe Lord has sworn, and will not repent.

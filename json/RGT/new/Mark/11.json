And as soon as you enter it, you shall find a colt tied, upon which never a man sat. Untie him and bring him.", "3": "\u201cAnd if anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' Say that the Lord has need of him. And He will return him immediately.\u201d", "4": "And they went their way and found a colt, tied by the door outside, at an intersection. And they untied him.", "5": "Then some of those who stood there said to them, \u201cWhy are you untying that colt?\u201d", "6": "And they said to them as Jesus had commanded them.

Be ready, in season and out of season. Convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and teaching.", "3": "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine. But having itching ears, they shall gather a heap of teachers according to their own lusts", "4": "and shall turn their ears from the truth and shall be given to fables.", "5": "But you, be sober in all things. Suffer adversity. Do the work of an evangelist. Carry out your ministry fully.", "6": "For I am already being offered. And the time of my departing is at hand.", "7": "I have fought the good fight and have finished my course. I have kept the faith.", "8": "Hereafter, the crown of righteousness - which the Lord, the Righteous Judge, shall give me on that Day - is laid up for me.

May it not be counted against them.", "17": "But the Lord assisted me and strengthened me; so that by me the preaching might be fully believed, and that all the Gentiles should hear.

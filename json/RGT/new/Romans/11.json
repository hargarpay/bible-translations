{"1": "I say then, has not God thrust away His people? Absolutely not! For I am also an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.", "2": "God has not thrust away His people, whom He knew before. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah; how he intercedes with God against Israel, saying,", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed your Prophets, and dug down Your altars. And I am left alone. And they seek my life\u201d?", "4": "But what does God say in response to him? \u201cI have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal\u201d.", "5": "Even so then, at this present time, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.", "6": "And if it is of grace, it is no more of works. Or else grace would no longer be grace. And if it is of works, it is no longer grace. Or else work would no longer be work.", "7": "What then? Israel has not obtained what it sought. But the Elect have obtained it. And the rest have been hardened.", "8": "Just as it is written, \u201cGod has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear until this day\u201d.", "9": "And David says, \u201cLet their table be made a snare, and a net, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them.", "10": "\u201cLet their eyes be darkened that they do not see and bow down their back continually.", "11": "I say then, have they stumbled so that they should fall? Absolutely not! But through their fall, salvation comes to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.", "12": "Yet, if their fall is the riches of the world - and the their diminishing the riches of the Gentiles - how much more shall their fulfillment be?", "13": "For in speaking to you Gentiles (inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles) I magnify my office,", "14": "if, somehow, I might provoke those of my flesh to follow them and save some of them.", "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what shall their acceptance be if not life from the dead?", "16": "For if the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole lump. And if the root is holy, so are the branches.", "17": "And though some of the branches are broken off, and you (being a wild olive tree) were grafted in among them, and made a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree,", "18": "do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember you do not support the root, but the root supports you.", "19": "You will say then, \u201cThe branches have been broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u201d", "20": "Well said. Through unbelief they have been broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be high-minded, but fear.", "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either.", "22": "Behold, therefore, the kindness and severity of God - severity toward those who have fallen, but kindness toward you - if you continue in His kindness. Or else you shall also be cut off.", "23": "And they also, if they do not still remain in unbelief, shall be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.", "24": "For if you were cut out of the olive tree (which is wild by nature) and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall those who are natural be grafted into their own olive tree?", "25": "For I do not wish you to be ignorant of this secret, brothers (lest you be wise in your own eyes), that partial blindness has come to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.", "26": "And so all Israel shall be saved. As it is written, \u201cThe Deliverer shall come out of Zion, and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob.", "27": "And this is My covenant to them, When I shall take away their sins.\u201d", "28": "Concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.", "29": "For the gifts and calling of God are without irrevocable.", "30": "For even as you, in times past, had not believed God and yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief,", "31": "so now have they not believed by the mercy shown to you, so that they may also obtain mercy.", "32": "For God has shut up all in unbelief, so that He might have mercy on all.", "33": "O the depth of the riche of both the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!", "34": "For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who was His counselor?", "35": "Or who has given to Him first, that he shall be recompensed?", "36": "For of Him, and through Him, and for Him are all things. To Him be glory forever. Amen."}

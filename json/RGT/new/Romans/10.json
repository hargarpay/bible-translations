(that is, to bring Christ down)", "7": "or, 'Who shall descend into the deep?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)\u201d.", "8": "So, what does it say? \u201cThe word is near you; your mouth, and in your heart.\u201d This is the word of faith which we preach.", "9": "For if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and shall believe in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you shall be saved.", "10": "For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses unto salvation.", "11": "For the Scripture says, \u201cWhoever believes in Him, shall not be ashamed.\u201d", "12": "For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek.

As it is written: \u201cHow beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of peace; and bring glad tidings of good things!\u201d", "16": "But they have not all obeyed the Gospel. For Isaiah says, \u201cLord, who has believed our report?\u201d", "17": "Then faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.", "18": "But I say, have they not heard? No doubt. Their sound went out through all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.", "19": "But I say, did not Israel know? First Moses says: \u201cI will provoke you to envy by a nation that is not my nation. And by a foolish nation I will anger you.\u201d", "20": "And Isaiah is bold and says: \u201cI was found by those who did not seek Me, and have been made manifest to those who did not ask for me.\u201d", "21": "And to Israel he says, \u201cAll day long I have stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.\u201d"}

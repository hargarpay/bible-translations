And another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.", "3": "Do not let the one who eats treat the one who does not eat with contempt. And do not let the one who does not eat judge the one who eats. For God has received him.", "4": "Who are you to judge another man's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he shall be upheld. For God is able to make him stand.", "5": "One esteems one day above another day, and another counts every day alike. Let everyone be fully persuaded in his own mind.", "6": "Whoever observes the day, observes it to the Lord. And whoever does not observe the day, does not observe it to the Lord. Whoever eats, eats to the Lord. For he gives God thanks. And whoever does not eat, does not eat to the Lord, and gives God thanks.", "7": "For none of us lives to himself. Nor does anyone die to himself.", "8": "For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord: Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.", "9": "For to this end Christ died and rose again, and revived, so that He might be Lord, both of the dead and the living.", "10": "But why do you condemn your brother?

But to the one who judges something to be unclean, to him it is unclean.", "15": "But if your brother is distressed because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food someone for whom Christ died.", "16": "Therefore, do not let your good be spoken of as evil.", "17": "For the kingdom of God is not food nor drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.", "18": "For whoever serves Christ in these things, is well-pleasing to God, and is approved by men.", "19": "Let us then follow those things which concern peace, and with which one may edify another.", "20": "Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. Indeed, all things are clean, but evil for the man who eats in offense.", "21": "It is not good to eat flesh or to drink wine, or to do anything whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or made weak.", "22": "Do you have faith?

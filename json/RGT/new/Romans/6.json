{"1": "What, then, shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, so that grace may abound? Absolutely not!", "2": "How shall we, who are dead to sin, still live in it?", "3": "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into his death?", "4": "We are then buried with Him, through baptism, into His death; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead, to the glory of the Father, we also should walk in newness of life.", "5": "For if we are united with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall also be so in the likeness of his resurrection;", "6": "knowing this: that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, and that henceforth we should not serve sin.", "7": "For whoever has died, is freed from sin.", "8": "Therefore, if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,", "9": "knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death has no more dominion over Him.", "10": "For, in that He died, he died once to sin. But in that he lives, he lives to God.", "11": "Likewise, you also consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God, in Jesus Christ our Lord.", "12": "Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey its lusts;", "13": "nor give the parts of your body to sin, as weapons of unrighteousness. But give yourselves to God, as those who are alive from the dead. And give the parts of your body to God, as weapons of righteousness.", "14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you. For you are not under the Law, but under grace.", "15": "What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the Law, but under grace? Absolutely not!", "16": "Do you not know that to whomever you give yourselves as servants, to obey, you are his servants whom you obey; whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?", "17": "Thanks be to God that, although you had been the servants of sin, you have obeyed (from the heart) the type of doctrine by which you were delivered.", "18": "Being then made free from sin, you are made the servants of righteousness.", "19": "I speak as a man, because of the weakness of your flesh. For as you have given the parts of your body over as servants to impurity and lawlessness, to commit lawlessness, so now give the parts of your body over as servants to righteousness in holiness.", "20": "For when you were the servants of sin, you were freed from righteousness.", "21": "What fruit did you then have in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.", "22": "But now, being freed from sin, and made servants to God, you have your fruit in holiness; and in the end, everlasting life.", "23": "For the wages of sin is death. But the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord."}

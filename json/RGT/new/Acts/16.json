So, he took and circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in that area (for they all knew that his father was Greek).", "4": "And as they went through the cities, they delivered the decrees to keep, ordained by the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.", "5": "And so the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.", "6": "Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.", "7": "Then they came to Mysia and sought to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit did not allow them.", "8": "Therefore they passed through Mysia, and came down to Troas,", "9": "where a vision appeared to Paul in the night: A Macedonian man stood and pleaded with him, saying, \u201cCome into Macedonia, and help us!\u201d", "10": "And after he had seen the vision, we immediately prepared to go into Macedonia, being assured that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel to them.", "11": "Then went we forth from Troas. And with a straight course, we came to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis;", "12": "and from there to Philippi (which is the chief city in the parts of Macedonia, and whose inhabitants came from Rome to dwell there). And we stayed in that city some days.", "13": "And on the Sabbath day, we went out of the city, to a riverside where they customarily prayed.

Certainly not! But let them come and bring us out.\u201d", "38": "And the sergeants told these words to the governors, who were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.", "39": "Then they came and pleaded with them; and brought them out and asked them to leave the city.", "40": "And they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia.

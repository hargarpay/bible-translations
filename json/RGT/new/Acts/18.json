I am clean. From now on will I go to the Gentiles.\u201d", "7": "So he left there and entered into the house of a man named Justus (a worshipper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue).", "8": "And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing it, believed and were baptized.", "9": "Then the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, \u201cDo not fear, but speak.

But while they prepared it, he fell into a trance.", "11": "And he saw the sky opened. And a certain vessel came down to him, like a great sheet, tied at the four corners, and being let down to the earth.", "12": "Inside were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things, and birds of the heaven.", "13": "And there came a voice to him, \u201cArise, Peter. Kill, and eat.\u201d", "14": "But Peter said, \u201cNot so, Lord. For I have never eaten anything that is polluted or unclean.\u201d", "15": "And the voice spoke to him again a second time, \u201cThe things which God has cleansed, do not make common.\u201d", "16": "This was done three times.

For I have sent them.", "21": "Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, \u201cBehold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?\u201d", "22": "And they said, \u201cCornelius the Captain - a just man, and one who fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews - was warned from heaven by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear your words.\u201d", "23": "Then he called them in and lodged them.

But God has shown me that I should not call any man common, or unclean.", "29": "\u201cTherefore I came to you without saying no when I was summoned. I ask, then, the reason why have you sent for me?\u201d", "30": "Then Cornelius said, \u201cFour days ago, about this hour, I fasted. And at the ninth hour, I prayed in my house. And behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,", "31": "\u201cand said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard.

And you have done well to come. Now, therefore, are we all present here before God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.\u201d", "34": "Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, \u201cTruthfully, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.", "35": "\u201cBut in every nation, the one who fears Him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to Him.", "36": "\u201cThe word - which God has sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, Who is Lord of all -", "37": "\u201cyou know the word which came through all Judea, beginning in Galilee, after the Baptism which John preached;", "38": "\u201chow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power - Who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil - for God was with Him.", "39": "\u201cAnd we are witnesses of all things done by Him Whom they killed and hung on a tree (things in both the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem).", "40": "\u201cGod raised Him up the third day, and showed Him openly -", "41": "\u201cnot to all the people, but to the witnesses chosen by God beforehand - to those of us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.", "42": "\u201cAnd He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that He has been ordained by God as a judge of quick and dead.", "43": "\u201cTo Him also give all the Prophets witness, that through His Name all who believe in Him shall receive forgiveness of sins.\u201d", "44": "While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell upon all those who heard the word.", "45": "So those of the circumcision who believed (as many as had come with Peter), were astonished because the gift of the Holy Ghost was also poured out on the Gentiles.", "46": "For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.

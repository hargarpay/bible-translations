{"1": "Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hand to afflict some of the church,", "2": "And he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.", "3": "And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further, to take Peter also (during the Days of Unleavened Bread.)", "4": "And when he had caught him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to be kept, intending to bring him forth to the people after the Passover.", "5": "So Peter was kept in prison. But earnest prayer was made to God for him by the church.", "6": "And the night when Herod wished to have him brought out to the people, Peter slept between two soldiers, bound with two chains. And the guards before the door kept the prison.", "7": "And behold, the Angel of the Lord came upon them. And a light shined in the house. And he struck Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, \u201cArise quickly!\u201d And his chains fell off his hands.", "8": "And the angel said to him, \u201cDress yourself. And put on your sandals.\u201d And so he did. Then he said to him, \u201cWrap your garment around you, and follow me.\u201d", "9": "So Peter came out and followed him; and did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he had seen a vision.", "10": "Now, after they had passed the first and the second guards, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them by itself. And they went out and passed through one street. And immediately the angel departed from him.", "11": "And when Peter had come to himself, he said, \u201cNow I know for certain that the Lord has sent his Angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectations of the Jewish people.\u201d", "12": "And as he considered it, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John (whose surname was Mark), where many were gathered together and prayed.", "13": "And when Peter knocked at the entry door, a girl named Rhoda came forth to answer it.", "14": "But when she recognized Peter's voice, she did not open the gate. But with gladness, she ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate.", "15": "But they said to her, \u201cYou are mad.\u201d Still she kept affirming that it was so. Then they said, \u201cIt is his angel.\u201d", "16": "But Peter continued knocking. And when they had opened it, and saw him, they were astonished.", "17": "And with his hand he asked them to be silent. And he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, \u201cGo show these things to James and to the brothers.\u201d And he departed and went into another place.", "18": "Now as soon as it was day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.", "19": "And when Herod had asked for and not found him, he examined the guards, and commanded them to be led away for punishment. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.", "20": "Then Herod was angry with those of Tyre and Sidon. But they all came to him with one mind.

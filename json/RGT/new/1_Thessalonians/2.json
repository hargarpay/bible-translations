But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.", "17": "But since, brothers, we were kept from you for a season (as far as sight, but not in the heart), we were eager to see your face with great desire.", "18": "Therefore, we would have come to you (I Paul, at least once or twice) but Satan hindered us.", "19": "For what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing?

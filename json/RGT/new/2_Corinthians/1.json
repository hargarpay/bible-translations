Or, if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.", "7": "And our hope is steadfast concerning you, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you also be of the consolation.", "8": "For brothers, we would not have you be ignorant of our affliction, which came to us in Asia; how we were pressed beyond measure, passing strength, so that we utterly despaired, even of life.", "9": "But, we received the sentence of death in ourselves, because we should not rest in ourselves, but in God, Who raised the dead.", "10": "Who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver us. And in Whom also we have hope will still yet deliver.", "11": "So that you labor together in prayer for us, that thanks on our behalf may be given by many for the grace bestowed upon us through many.", "12": "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience: that in simplicity and godly purity, not in fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and most of all towards you.", "13": "For we write no other things to you than what you read and understand. And I hope you shall understand even to the end,", "14": "as you have understood us partly, that we are your exultation, even as you are ours, on the day of our Lord Jesus.", "15": "And in this confidence, I initially intended to come to you. So that you might have had a second grace;", "16": "and to pass by you into Macedonia; and to come again to you, out of Macedonia; and to be led forth by you toward Judea.", "17": "Therefore, when I was thus-minded did I use lightness? Or do I purpose those things which I purpose according to the flesh, that with me should be, \u201cYes, yes\u201d, and \u201cNo, no\u201d?", "18": "But God is faithful. So that our word toward you was not \u201cYes\u201d, and \u201cNo\u201d.", "19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, Who was preached among you by us - by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy - was not \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d. But in Him was \u201cYes\u201d.", "20": "For all the promises of God in Him are \u201cYes\u201d, and in Him \u201cAmen\u201d, to the glory of God through us.", "21": "And it is God Who established us with you in Christ and has anointed us.", "22": "Who has also sealed us and has given the earnest portion of the Spirit in our hearts.", "23": "Now, I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you, I have not as yet come to Corinth.", "24": "Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy.

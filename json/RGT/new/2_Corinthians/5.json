{"1": "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is destroyed, we have a building given by God; that is, a house, made not with hands, but eternal, in the heavens.", "2": "For therefore we sigh, desiring to be clothed with our house, which is from heaven.", "3": "Because if we are clothed, we shall not be found naked.", "4": "For indeed we who are in this tabernacle, sigh, and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed. So that mortality might be swallowed up in life.", "5": "And He Who has created us for this thing, is God; Who also has given us the earnest portion of the Spirit.", "6": "Therefore we are always bold. Although we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.", "7": "(For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)", "8": "Nevertheless, we are bold, and are well-pleased rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.", "9": "Therefore also, we desire eagerly, whether present or absent, to be acceptable to him.", "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that everyone may receive the things done through the body, according to what he has done, whether good or evil.", "11": "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men and are made manifest to God. And I trust also that we are made manifest in your consciences.", "12": "For we do not commend ourselves to you again but give you an occasion to exult on our behalf, so that you may have an answer toward those who rejoice in appearance, and not in the heart.", "13": "For if we are out of our wits, we are so to God: or if we are in our right minds, we are so to you.", "14": "For the love of Christ constrains us,", "15": "Because we thus judge: that if One is dead for all, then were all dead. And He died for all, so that those who live, should henceforth no longer live for themselves, but for Him Who died for them, and rose again.", "16": "Therefore, henceforth we consider no one according to the flesh. Yea, even though we had known Christ according to the flesh, we do so no more.", "17": "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things have become new.", "18": "And all things are of God, Who has reconciled us unto Himself by Jesus Christ, and has given unto us the ministry of reconciliation.", "19": "For God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to Himself, not imputing their sins unto them; and has committed the word of reconciliation to us.", "20": "Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God is exhorting you through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God!", "21": "For He has made him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin; that we should be made the righteousness of God in Him."}

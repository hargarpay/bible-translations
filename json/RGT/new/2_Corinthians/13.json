{"1": "This is the third time that I come to you. In the mouths of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.", "2": "I told you before, and tell you now beforehand, as though I had been present a second time. So I write now - being absent from those who until now have sinned, and to all others - that if I come again, I will not spare anyone;", "3": "since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me, Who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.", "4": "For though He was crucified through His weakness, yet He lives through the power of God. And we, no doubt, are weak in Him. But we shall live with Him, through the power of God, toward you.", "5": "Test yourselves, whether you are in the faith. Examine yourselves. Do you not know yourselves how that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disqualified?", "6": "But I trust that you shall know that we are not disqualified.", "7": "Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should seem approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we may be disqualified.", "8": "For we cannot do anything against the truth, but for the truth.", "9": "For we are glad when we are weak, and you are strong. For this also we pray: even your perfecting.", "10": "Therefore, I write these things while being absent (so that when I am present, I should not use sharpness) according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.", "11": "Finally brothers, farewell. Be perfect. Be of good comfort. Be of one mind. Live in peace. And the God of love and peace shall be with you.", "12": "Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the Saints salute you.", "13": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ - and the love of God - and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen. (the second Epistle to the Corinthians written from Philippi - a city in Macedonia - and sent by Titus and Lucas)"}

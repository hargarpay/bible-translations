{"1": "We also make known to you, brothers, the grace of God bestowed upon the Churches of Macedonia.", "2": "Because, in great trial of affliction, their joy abounded, and their most extreme poverty abounded unto their rich generosity.", "3": "For to their power I bear record. Yea, and beyond their power they were willing.", "4": "And asked us with great instance to receive the grace and fellowship of the ministry which is toward the Saints.", "5": "And this they did, not as we expected; but gave themselves, first to the Lord, and afterwards to us, by the will of God;", "6": "that we should exhort Titus to accomplish the same grace among you which he had begun.", "7": "Therefore, as you abound in everything - in faith and word and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love towards us - see that you also abound in this grace.", "8": "This I say not by commandment, but because of the diligence of others. Therefore, I prove the sincerity of your love.", "9": "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: that He, being rich, became poor for your sakes. So that you, through his poverty, might be made rich.", "10": "And in this I give my counsel. For it is profitable for those of you who a year ago began not only to do, but also to will.", "11": "Now therefore, complete the doing of it also. So that as there was a readiness of will, you may also complete it out of that which you have.", "12": "For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted, according to what one has, and not according to what he has not.", "13": "Nor should others be eased, and you grieved.

Yea, he was so careful, that of his own accord he went to you.", "18": "And we have also sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches.", "19": "And not only so but was also chosen by the churches to be a fellow traveler concerning this grace that is ministered by us, to the glory of the same Lord, and the declaration of your eager mind.", "20": "And so avoiding this: that no one should blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us,", "21": "providing for honest things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.", "22": "And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but who is now much more diligent because of the great confidence in you.", "23": "And if anyone asks about Titus, he is my partner and helper concerning you; or of our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.", "24": "Therefore, show toward them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of the rejoicing that we have on your behalf."}

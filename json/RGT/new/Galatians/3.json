{"1": "O, foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth; before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?", "2": "This only would I learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law or by the hearing of faith?", "3": "Are you so foolish, that after you have begun in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?", "4": "Have you suffered so many things in vain, if so be it even in vain?", "5": "He, therefore, who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it through the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?", "6": "Rather, as Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness,", "7": "know you therefore that those who are of faith, are the same children of Abraham.", "8": "For the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached the Gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, \u201cIn you shall all the Gentiles be blessed.\u201d", "9": "So then those who are of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham.", "10": "For as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse. For it is written, \u201cCursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.\u201d", "11": "And it is evident that no one is justified by the Law, in the sight of God. For the just shall live by faith.", "12": "And the Law is not of faith: but the one who shall do those things, shall live in them.", "13": "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us, (for it is written, \u201cCursed is everyone who hangs on a tree\u201d).", "14": "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus. That we might receive the promise of the Spirit, through faith.", "15": "Brothers, I speak as men do: Though it be but a man's covenant, when it is confirmed, no one ignores it, or adds anything to it.", "16": "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He does not say, \u201cand to the seeds\u201d, as speaking of many, but, \u201cAnd to your seed\u201d, as of one, which is Christ.", "17": "And this I say, that the covenant that was previously confirmed by God in Christ, cannot be annulled by the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after; so that it should make the promise of no effect.", "18": "For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no more by the promise. But God gave it freely to Abraham by promise.", "19": "Why, then, the Law? It was added because of the transgressions; till the seed came, to which the promise was made. And it was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.", "20": "However, there is no Mediator of one. But God is one.", "21": "Is the Law, then, against the promises of God? Never may it be! For if there had been a Law given which could have given life, surely righteousness should have been by the Law.", "22": "But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise, by faith in Jesus Christ, should be given to those who believe.", "23": "But before faith came, we were kept under the Law, as under guard, and locked up, until that faith which should be revealed.", "24": "So that the Law was our tutor, bringing us to Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith.", "25": "But after that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.", "26": "For you are all the sons of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.", "27": "For all you who were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.", "28": "There is neither Jew nor Grecian. There is neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.", "29": "And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs by promise."}

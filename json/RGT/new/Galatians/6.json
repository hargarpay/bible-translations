{"1": "Brothers, even if a man should be overcome in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such one with the spirit of humility, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.", "2": "Bear one another's burden, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.", "3": "For if anyone seems to himself something, when he is nothing. He deceives himself.", "4": "But let everyone test his own work. And then shall he boast in himself only and not in another.", "5": "For everyone shall bear his own burden.", "6": "Let the one who is taught in the word make the one who has taught him a partaker of all good things.", "7": "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.", "8": "For the one who sows to his flesh, shall reap destruction of the flesh. But the one who sows to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.", "9": "Let us not, therefore, be weary of well-doing. For in due season, we shall reap, if we do not grow weary.", "10": "Therefore, while we have time, let us do good to all; and now especially to those who are of the household of the faith.", "11": "You see how large the letters are which I have written to you with my own hand.", "12": "As many as desire to have a fair appearance in the flesh, they urge you to be circumcised, only because they would not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.", "13": "For they themselves who are circumcised do not keep the Law, but desire to have you circumcised, so that they might boast in your flesh.", "14": "But may it never be that I should boast in anything but the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; whereby the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world!", "15": "For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creature.", "16": "And as many as walk according to this rule, peace shall be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.", "17": "From henceforth let no one give me trouble. For I bear on my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.", "18": "Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. (to the Galatians; written from Rome.)"}

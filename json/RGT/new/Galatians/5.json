{"1": "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty whereby Christ has made us free. And be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.", "2": "Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if you shall become circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.", "3": "For I testify again to every man who is circumcised, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.", "4": "You are severed from Christ. Whoever is justified by the Law, you are fallen from grace.", "5": "For we, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness through faith.", "6": "For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith (which works by love).", "7": "You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?", "8": "It is not the persuasion of the One who calls you.", "9": "A little leaven leavens the whole lump.", "10": "I have confidence in you, through the Lord, that you will be single-minded. But he who troubles you shall bear condemnation, whoever he might be.", "11": "And I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the stumbling block of the cross is abolished.", "12": "I even wish those who disquiet you would emasculate themselves.", "13": "For brothers, you have been called to freedom.

And these are contrary one to another, so that you cannot do the things you would like.", "18": "And if you be led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.", "19": "Moreover, the works of the flesh are obvious: adultery, fornication, impurity, lewdness,", "20": "idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissensions, heresies,", "21": "envy, murders, drunkenness, gluttony, and the like. And, just as I have told you before, those who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.", "22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,", "23": "gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.", "24": "For those who are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.", "25": "If we live in the Spirit, we should also walk in the Spirit.", "26": "Let us not become boastful, provoking one another, envying one another."}

And as He went, the people thronged Him.", "43": "And a woman having a twelve-year-long flow of blood (who had spent all she had on physicians, and could not be healed by any)", "44": "came behind Him. And she touched the hem of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.", "45": "Then Jesus said, \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d When everyone denied it, Peter and those with him said, \u201cMaster, the multitude jostles You, and presses against You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'\u201d", "46": "And Jesus said, \u201cSomeone touched Me. For I perceive that power has gone out of Me.\u201d", "47": "When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came, trembling, and fell down before Him.

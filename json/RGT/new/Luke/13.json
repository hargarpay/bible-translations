But unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.", "4": "\u201cOr do you think that those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell (and it killed them) were sinners above all men living in Jerusalem?", "5": "\u201cI tell you no. But unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.\u201d", "6": "He also spoke this parable: \u201cA certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. And he came and sought fruit from it and found none.", "7": "\u201cThen he said to the dresser of his vineyard, 'Behold, for three years I have come and sought fruit from this fig tree and found none.

And he doubted, because it was said by some that John had risen again from the dead.", "8": "And by some that Elijah had appeared. And by some that one of the old Prophets had risen again.", "9": "Then Herod said, \u201cJohn I have beheaded. Who then is this of Whom I hear such things?\u201d And he sought to see Him.", "10": "And when the Apostles returned, they told Him what great things they had done. Then He took them and went aside into a solitary place, near the city called Bethsaida.", "11": "But when the people knew of it, they followed Him. And He received them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and healed those needing to be healed.", "12": "And when the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, \u201cSend the people away, so that they may go into the surrounding towns and villages, and lodge, and get food. For we are here in a desert place.", "13": "But He said to them, \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d", "14": "For there were about five thousand men. Then He said to His disciples, \u201cMake them sit down in groups of fifty.\u201d", "15": "And they did so and made all sit down.", "16": "Then He took the five loaves, and the two fish, and looked up to Heaven and blessed them; and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the people.", "17": "So they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces from what remained.", "18": "And it happened that as He was alone praying, His disciples were with Him. And He asked them, saying, \u201cWhom do the people say that I am?\u201d", "19": "They answered, and said, \u201cJohn Baptist. And others say, Elijah. And some say that one of the old Prophets has risen again.\u201d", "20": "And He said to them, \u201cBut Whom do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered, and said, \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d", "21": "And He warned and commanded them to tell that to no one,", "22": "saying, \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, and by the chief priests and scribes, and be killed; and the third day rise again.\u201d", "23": "And He said to them all, \u201cIf anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.", "24": "\u201cFor whoever would save his life, shall lose it.

And His clothes became white and radiant.", "30": "And behold, two men talked with Him (who were Moses and Elijah),", "31": "They appeared in glory and told of His departure which he would accomplish at Jerusalem.", "32": "But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep. And when they awoke, they saw His glory, and the two men standing with him.", "33": "And it happened that as they departed from Him, Peter said to Jesus, \u201cMaster, it is good for us to be here. Therefore, let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,\u201d not knowing what he said.", "34": "While he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.", "35": "And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, \u201cThis is My beloved Son. Hear Him.\u201d", "36": "And after the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it secret and told no one in those days anything they had seen.", "37": "And it happened that on the next day, as they came down from the mountain, many people met Him.", "38": "And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, \u201cMaster, I beg You! Look upon my son! For he is all that I have!", "39": "\u201cAnd lo, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries. And he convulses him, so that he foams at the mouth. And when he has bruised him, he departs from him roughly.", "40": "\u201cNow I have begged Your disciples to cast him out, but they could not.", "41": "Then Jesus answered and said, \u201cO faithless and perverse generation! How long now shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u201d", "42": "And while He was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and returned him to his father.", "43": "And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. And while they all wondered at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,", "44": "\u201cLet these words sink down into your ears. For the time will come when the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.\u201d", "45": "But they did not understand that word, for it was hidden from them. So, they could not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask Him about that word.", "46": "Then a dispute arose among them: which one of them should be the greatest.", "47": "When Jesus saw the thoughts of their hearts, He took a little child and set him by Him.", "48": "And He said to them, \u201cWhoever receives this little child in My Name, receives Me. And whoever shall receive Me, receives Him Who sent Me. For the one who is least among you all shall be great.\u201d", "49": "And John answered and said, \u201cMaster, we saw one casting out demons in Your Name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.", "50": "Then Jesus said to him, \u201cDo not forbid him. For whoever is not against us, is with us.\u201d", "51": "And it happened that when it was time for Him to be received up, He set His face to go to Jerusalem,", "52": "And sent messengers before Him. And they went and entered into a town of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.", "53": "But they would not receive Him, because His face was set toward Jerusalem.", "54": "And when His disciples James and John saw it, they said, \u201cLord, do You want us to command that fire come down from Heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?\u201d", "55": "But Jesus turned around and rebuked them, and said, \u201cYou do not know of what spirit you are.", "56": "\u201cFor the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\u201d Then they went to another town.", "57": "And it happened that as they went on the way, a certain man said to Him, \u201cI will follow You, Lord, wherever You go!\u201d", "58": "And Jesus said to him, \u201cThe foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests. But the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.\u201d", "59": "But He said to another, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d But he said, \u201cLord, first let me go and bury my father.\u201d", "60": "And Jesus said to him, \u201cLet the dead bury their dead. But go and preach the Kingdom of God.\u201d", "61": "Then another said, \u201cI will follow You, Lord.

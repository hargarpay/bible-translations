{"1": "The elder, To the elect Lady and her children; whom I love in the truth; and not only me but also all who have known the truth", "2": "for the truth's sake; which dwells in us and shall be with us forever:", "3": "Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love.", "4": "I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, as per the commandment we have received from the Father.", "5": "And now I encourage you, Lady, (not as writing a new commandment to you, but the same which we had from the beginning) that we love one another.", "6": "And this is the love that we should walk in: His commandments. This commandment is: that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.", "7": "For many deceivers have entered into this world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an Antichrist.", "8": "Watch yourselves, so that we do not lose the things which we have done. But that we may receive a full reward.", "9": "Whoever transgresses, and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ, does not have God. The one who continues in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.", "10": "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, neither greet him nor receive him into your house.", "11": "For the one who greets him shares in his evil deeds. Although I had many things to write to you, I would rather not write with paper and ink. But I trust to come to you and speak mouth to mouth, so that our joy may be full.", "12": "The sons of your elect Sister greet you. Amen."}

{"1": "Therefore, be imitators of God, as beloved children.", "2": "And walk in love, just as Christ has loved us and has given Himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor to God.", "3": "But do not let fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness even be named among you (as is also becoming to saints),", "4": "nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse joking (which are not fitting); but rather the giving of thanks.", "5": "For this you know: that no fornicator, nor impure or covetous person, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God.", "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words. For the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.", "7": "Therefore, do not be companions with them.", "8": "For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light.", "9": "For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,", "10": "approving that which is pleasing to the Lord.", "11": "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. But rather, even expose them.", "12": "For it is shameful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.", "13": "But all things, when they are exposed by the light, are made visible. For it is light that makes all things visible.", "14": "Therefore it says, \u201cAwake, you who sleep. And stand up from the dead.

But that it should be holy and without blame.", "28": "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife, loves himself.", "29": "For no one ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord does the Church.", "30": "For we are members of his body, of His flesh and of His bones.", "31": "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cling to his wife. And the two shall be one flesh.", "32": "This is a great secret. But I speak concerning Christ and concerning the church.", "33": "Yet, let every one of you do the same. Let everyone love his wife, even as himself. And let the wife see that she fears her husband."}

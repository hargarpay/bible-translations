And whatever things they know naturally (as beasts which are without reason), in those things they corrupt themselves.", "11": "Woe to them! For they have followed the way of Cain and are cast away by the deceit of Balaam's wages, and perish in the rebellion of Korah!", "12": "These are reefs in your feasts of charity; feasting with you, shamelessly feeding themselves.

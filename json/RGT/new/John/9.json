{"1": "And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from his birth.", "2": "And His disciples asked Him, saying, \u201cMaster, who sinned - this man, or his parents - that he was born blind?\u201d", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cNeither this man nor his parents have sinned. But this is so that the works of God would be shown in him.", "4": "\u201cI must work the works of the One who sent Me, while it is day. The night comes, when no one can work.", "5": "\u201cAs long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u201d", "6": "As soon as He had thus spoken, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind with the clay.", "7": "And He said to him, \u201cGo. Wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent).\u201d Therefore, he went and washed, and came back seeing.", "8": "Now, the neighbors, and those who had seen him before, when he was blind, said, \u201cIs not this he who sat and begged?\u201d", "9": "Some said, \u201cThis is he.\u201d And others said, \u201cHe is like him.\u201d But he himself said, \u201cI am he!\u201d", "10": "Therefore they said to him, \u201cHow were your eyes opened?\u201d", "11": "He answered, and said, \u201cThe Man who is called 'Jesus' made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash'. So, I went and washed, and received sight.\u201d", "12": "Then they said to him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said, \u201cI cannot tell.\u201d", "13": "They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.", "14": "And it was the Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.", "15": "Then, again, the Pharisees also asked him how he had received sight. And he said to them, \u201cHe laid clay upon my eyes. And I washed. And now I see.\u201d", "16": "Then some of the Pharisees said, \u201cThis Man is not of God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.\u201d Others said, \u201cHow can a Man who is a sinner do such miracles?\u201d And there was a dissension among them.", "17": "Then they spoke to the blind again, \u201cWhat do you say about Him, since He has opened your eyes?\u201d And he said, \u201cHe is a Prophet.\u201d", "18": "Then the Jews did not believe him (that he had been blind and received his sight) until they had called the parents of him who had received sight.", "19": "And they asked them, saying, \u201cIs this your son, whom you say was born blind? How, then, does he now see?\u201d", "20": "His parents answered them, and said, \u201cWe know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.", "21": "\u201cBut by what means he now sees we do not know. Or, who has opened his eyes we cannot tell. He is old enough. Ask him. He shall answer for himself.\u201d", "22": "His parents spoke these words because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already ordained that if anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.", "23": "That is why his parents said, 'He is old enough. Ask him.'", "24": "Then again they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, \u201cGive glory to God. We know that this Man is a sinner.\u201d", "25": "Then he answered, and said, \u201cWhether He is a sinner or not, I cannot tell. One thing I know: that I was blind, and now I see!\u201d", "26": "Then they said to him again, \u201cWhat did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d", "27": "He answered them, \u201cI have told you already, and you have not heard it. Why would you hear it again? Do you also wish to be His disciples?", "28": "Then they reviled him, and said, \u201cYou be His disciple! We will be Moses' disciples!", "29": "\u201cWe know that God spoke with Moses. But we do not know from where this Man is.\u201d", "30": "The man answered, and said to them, \u201cDoubtless, this is a wondrous thing; that you do not know from where He is, and yet He has opened my eyes.", "31": "\u201cNow we know that God does not hear sinners. But if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does His will, He does hear him.", "32": "\u201cSince the world began it has been unheard of for anyone to open the eyes of one born blind.", "33": "\u201cIf this Man were not of God, He could have done nothing.\u201d", "34": "\u201cThey answered, and said to him, \u201cYou were born entirely in sin, and do you teach us?\u201d So, they cast him out.", "35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when He had found him, He said to him, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of God?\u201d", "36": "He answered, and said, \u201cWho is He, Lord, that I might believe in Him?\u201d", "37": "And Jesus said to him, \u201cYou have both seen Him, and it is He who is talking with you.\u201d", "38": "Then he said, \u201cLord, I believe!\u201d and worshiped Him.", "39": "And Jesus said, \u201cFor judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see, might see; and that those who see, might be made blind.\u201d", "40": "And some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things, and said to Him, \u201cAre we blind also?\u201d", "41": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, 'We see.' Therefore, your sin remains."}

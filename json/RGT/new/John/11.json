If someone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.", "10": "\u201cBut if someone walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.\u201d", "11": "He spoke these things. And afterward, He said to them, \u201cOur friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go to wake him up.\u201d", "12": "Then His disciples said, \u201cLord, if he sleeps, he shall heal.\u201d", "13": "However, Jesus spoke of his death. But they thought that He had spoken of the natural sleep.", "14": "Then Jesus said to them plainly, \u201cLazarus is dead.", "15": "\u201cAnd I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d", "16": "Then said Thomas (who is called Didymus) to his fellow disciples, \u201cLet us also go, that we may die with Him.\u201d", "17": "Then Jesus came and found that he had already been in the grave four days.", "18": "(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.)", "19": "And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them for their brother.", "20": "Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him.

And Pilate said to them, \u201cBehold the Man!\u201d", "6": "Then, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried, saying, \u201cCrucify, crucify Him!\u201d Pilate said to them, \u201cTake Him and crucify Him! For I find no fault in Him!\u201d", "7": "The Jews answered Him, \u201cWe have a law! And by our law, He ought to die.

Don't you know that I have power to crucify You, and have power to free You?", "11": "Jesus answered, \u201cYou could have no power at all against Me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore, the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.", "12": "From then on, Pilate sought to free Him.

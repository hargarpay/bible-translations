{"1": "And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of words, or of wisdom, showing to you the testimony of God.", "2": "For I decided not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.", "3": "And I was among you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.", "4": "Neither my word nor my preaching was in the enticing speech of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.", "5": "That your faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.", "6": "Rather, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, which come to nothing,", "7": "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God predetermined to our glory before the world,", "8": "and which none of the princes of this world have known. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.", "9": "But as it is written, 'The things which neither eye has seen, nor ear has heard, nor have come into man's heart, are those which God has prepared for those who love Him.'", "10": "But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit. For the spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.", "11": "For what man knows the things of a man, except the spirit of a man, which is in him? So also, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.", "12": "Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit, Who is from God, that we might know the things that are given to us from God,", "13": "of which things we also speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but those which the holy Ghost teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.", "14": "But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him, nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.", "15": "But he who is spiritual, discerns all things. Yet, he himself is judged by no one.", "16": "For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he might instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ."}

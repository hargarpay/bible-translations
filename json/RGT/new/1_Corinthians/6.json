{"1": "Do any of you dare, when having business against another, to be judged by the unjust, and not by the Saints?", "2": "Do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world? If the world then shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?", "3": "Do you not know that we shall judge the angels? How much more so things that pertain to this life?", "4": "If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set those up who are least-esteemed in the Church.", "5": "I speak this to your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you? No, not one, who can judge between his brothers?", "6": "But a brother goes to law with a brother, and then before unbelievers!", "7": "Therefore, it is now a total defeat for you, that you go to law with one another. Rather, why do you not suffer wrong? Rather, why do you not sustain harm?", "8": "But, you yourselves do wrong, and do harm, and that to your brothers!", "9": "Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor homosexuals,", "10": "nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of God.", "11": "And such were some of you. But you are washed. But you are sanctified. But you are justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.", "12": "All things are lawful to me. But all things are not profitable. I may do all things, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.", "13": "Foods for the belly, and the belly for the foods. But God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.", "14": "And God has also raised up the Lord, and shall raise us up, by His power.", "15": "Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!", "16": "Do you not know that he who couples himself with a prostitute is one body? For two, says He, shall be one flesh.", "17": "But the one who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.", "18": "Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body. But the one who commits fornication, sins against his own body.", "19": "Do you not know that your body is the temple of the holy Ghost, Who is in you, Whom you have from God? And you are not your own.", "20": "For you are bought for a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, for they are God's."}

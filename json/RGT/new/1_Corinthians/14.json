{"1": "Pursue love, and desire spiritual things, more so that you may prophesy.", "2": "For the one who speaks in a tongue, speaks not to men, but to God. For no one hears. But in the spirit he speaks secret things.", "3": "But the one who prophesies, speaks to men for edification, and exhortation, and comfort.", "4": "The one who speaks in a tongue, edifies himself. But the one who prophesies, edifies the Church.", "5": "Now, I would prefer that you all spoke in tongues, even more so that you prophesied. For greater is the one who prophesies, than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the Church may receive edification.", "6": "And now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I benefit you, unless I speak to you by either revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?", "7": "Just as things without life give a sound, whether a pipe or a harp, how shall it be known what is piped or harped unless a distinction is made between the sounds?", "8": "And also if the trumpet gives a uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to battle?", "9": "So likewise you, by the tongue, unless you utter words that are understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For you shall speak into the air.", "10": "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them without significance.", "11": "Unless, then, I know the miraculous power of the voice, I shall be to him who speaks a Barbarian, and he who speaks, shall be to me a Barbarian.", "12": "Even so, since you covet spiritual things, seek that you may excel at the edifying of the Church.", "13": "Therefore, let him who speaks a tongue, pray that he may interpret.", "14": "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is without fruit.", "15": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit. but I will sing with the understanding also.", "16": "Or else, when you bless with the spirit, how shall the one who fills the place of the unlearned say, 'Amen', at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not know what you say?", "17": "For truly you give thanks well, but the other is not edified.", "18": "I thank my God I speak languages more than you all.", "19": "Yet I would rather speak five words in my own understanding while also instructing others in the Church, than speak ten thousand words in a tongue.", "20": "Brothers, do not be children in understanding, but concerning wickedness be children; in understanding be of a ripe age.", "21": "In the Law it is written, \u201c'By men of other tongues, and by other languages, will I speak to this people. Yet so shall they not hear me', says the Lord.\u201d", "22": "Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to those who do not believe. And prophesying is not for unbelievers, but for believers.", "23": "If therefore, when the whole Church comes together as one, and all speak tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned, or those who do not believe, will they not say that you are out of your wits?", "24": "But if all prophesy, and there comes in one who does not believe, or one unlearned, he is rebuked by all and is examined by all.", "25": "And so are the secrets of his heart made manifest. And so he will fall down on his face and worship God, and say plainly that God is in you indeed.", "26": "What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a Psalm, has doctrine, has a tongue, has revelation, has interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.", "27": "If anyone speaks a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most, by three, and each in turn. And let one interpret.", "28": "But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the Church. And let him speak to himself, and to God.", "29": "Let the Prophets speak, two or three, and let the others judge.", "30": "And if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent.", "31": "For you may all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn, and all may be encouraged.", "32": "And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.", "33": "For God is not of confusion, but of peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.", "34": "Let your women keep silent in the Churches. For it is not permitted for them to speak, but to be in submission, as also the Law says.", "35": "And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for women to speak in the Church.", "36": "Did the word of God come out from you? Or did it come to you only?", "37": "If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.", "38": "But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.", "39": "Therefore, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.", "40": "Let all things be done properly, and with order."}

{"1": "Moreover brothers, I declare to you the Gospel which I preached to you, which you have also received, and wherein you continue,", "2": "And whereby you are saved, if you keep in memory the word which I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.", "3": "For first of all, I delivered to you that which I received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures.", "4": "And that He was buried, and that He arose the third day, according to the Scriptures.", "5": "And that He was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve.", "6": "After that, He was seen by more than five hundred brothers at once, of whom many remain to this time, and some also are asleep.", "7": "After that, He was seen by James, then by all the Apostles.", "8": "And last of all he was seen also by me, as by one born at the wrong time.", "9": "For I am the least of the Apostles, who is not fit to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.", "10": "But by the grace of God I am that I am. And His grace which is in me, was not in vain. But I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.", "11": "Therefore, whether it was me or them, so we preach and so have you believed.", "12": "Now if it is preached that Christ is risen from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?", "13": "For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.", "14": "And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain.", "15": "And we are found also false witnesses of God. For we have testified of God, that He has raised up Christ, Whom He has not raised up, if it be so that the dead are not raised.", "16": "For if the dead are not raised, then Christ is not raised.", "17": "And if Christ is not raised, your faith is vain. You are still in your sins.", "18": "And so those who are asleep in Christ, have perished.", "19": "If it is only in this life that we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.", "20": "But now Christ has been raised from the dead and made the firstfruits of those who slept.", "21": "For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead.", "22": "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.", "23": "Yet, each in his own order: the Firstfruits, Christ; afterward, those who are of Christ, at His coming.", "24": "Then, the end, when He has delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He has abolished all rule, and all authority and power.", "25": "For He must reign till He has put all His enemies under His feet.", "26": "The last enemy that shall be ended, is death.", "27": "For He has subjected all things under His feet. (And when He says that all things are subjected, it is obvious that He is excepted, Who subjected all things under Himself.)", "28": "And when all things shall be subjected to Him, then shall the Son also, Himself, be subject to Him, Who subjected all things under Him, so that God may be all in all.", "29": "Or else what shall they do who are baptized for dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they baptized for dead?", "30": "Why are we also in danger every hour?", "31": "By your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.", "32": "If, after the habit of man, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead are not raised up?  Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.", "33": "Do not be deceived. Bad company corrupts good morals.", "34": "Awake to righteousness, and do not sin. For some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.", "35": "But someone will say, \u201cHow are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come forth?\u201d", "36": "O fool. That which you sow does not come alive unless it dies.", "37": "And that which you sow, you do not sow the body that shall be, but bare corn as it falls, of wheat, or of some other.", "38": "But God gives it a body at His pleasure, even to every seed his own body.", "39": "All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.", "40": "There are also heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.", "41": "There is another glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For one star differs from another star in glory.", "42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption and is raised in incorruption.", "43": "It is sown in dishonor and is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness and is raised in power.", "44": "It is sown a natural body and is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.", "45": "As it is also written, \u201cThe first man Adam was made a living soul.\u201d And the last Adam was made a life-giving spirit.", "46": "But that which is spiritual was not first; but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.", "47": "The first man is of the earth, earthly. The second Man is the Lord from heaven.", "48": "As is the earthly, such are those who are earthly. And as is the heavenly, such are those also who are heavenly.", "49": "And as we have borne the image of the earthly, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly.", "50": "This I say, brothers: that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.", "51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,", "52": "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall blow, and the dead shall be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed.", "53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on immortality.", "54": "So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, \u201cDeath is swallowed up into victory.\u201d", "55": "O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?", "56": "The sting of death is sin. And the strength of sin is the Law.", "57": "But thanks be to God, Who has given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.", "58": "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, abundant always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."}

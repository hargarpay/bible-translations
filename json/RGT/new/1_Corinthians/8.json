{"1": "And concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.", "2": "Now, if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.", "3": "But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.", "4": "Therefore, concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.", "5": "For though there are those that are called gods, whether in Heaven or on Earth (as there are many gods, and many lords.)", "6": "Yet to us there is but one God, the Father (from Whom are all things, and we are in him), and one Lord Jesus Christ, (through Whom are all things, and we are through him).", "7": "But not everyone has that knowledge. For some, being conscience of the idol until now, eat as though sacrificing to an idol. And so, their conscience, being weak, is defiled.", "8": "But food does not make us commendable to God. For we are neither more so if we eat it, nor less so if we do not eat it.", "9": "But take heed, lest by any means this power of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.", "10": "For if anyone sees you, who has knowledge, sit at table in the idols' temple, shall not his conscience, which is weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?", "11": "And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died.", "12": "Now when you sin so against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.", "13": "So if food offends my brother, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, that I may not offend my brother."}

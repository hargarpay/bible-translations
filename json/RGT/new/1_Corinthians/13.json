{"1": "Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and do not have love, I am as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.", "2": "And though I may have the gift of prophecy, and know all secrets and all knowledge; indeed, if I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and do not have love, I am nothing.", "3": "And though I feed the poor with all my goods, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing.", "4": "Love is patient. Love is kind. Love does not envy. Love does not boast and is not puffed up,", "5": "It is not rude. It is not selfish. It is not provoked to anger. It thinks no evil:", "6": "It does not rejoice in injustice but rejoices in the truth.", "7": "It bears all things: It believes all things. It hopes all things. It endures all things.", "8": "Love never fails; even though prophecies are ended, languages cease, and knowledge fades away.", "9": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.", "10": "But when That which is perfect comes, then that which is in part shall be abolished.", "11": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things.", "12": "For now we see through a glass darkly. But then shall we see face to face. Now I know in part. But then shall I know just as I also am known.", "13": "And yet remain faith, hope, love; these three. But the greatest of these is love."}

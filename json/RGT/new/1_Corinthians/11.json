{"1": "Be followers of me, just as I am of Christ.", "2": "Now brothers, I praise you, that you remember all my things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.", "3": "But I would have you know that Christ is the head of every man. And the head of the woman, man. And the head of Christ, God.", "4": "Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his head.", "5": "Every woman who prays or prophesies bareheaded dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.", "6": "Therefore, if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. And if it is shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.", "7": "For a man ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.", "8": "For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man.", "9": "For the man was not created for the woman's sake, but the woman for the man's sake.", "10": "Because of this ought the woman to have power upon her head, because of the angels.", "11": "Nevertheless, neither is the man separate from the woman, nor the woman separate from the man, in the Lord.", "12": "For as the woman is from the man, so is the man also by the woman. But all things are from God.", "13": "Judge in yourselves, is it proper that a woman pray to God uncovered?", "14": "Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it dishonors him?", "15": "But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her. For her hair is given her for a covering.", "16": "But if anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.", "17": "Now in this message I do not praise: that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.", "18": "For first of all, I hear that there are divisions among you when you come together in the church. And in part I believe it.", "19": "For there must also be heresies among you, so that those who are approved might be known among you.", "20": "Therefore, when you come together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.", "21": "For everyone, when he eats, takes his own supper beforehand. And one is hungry and another is drunk.", "22": "What!? Do you not have houses in which to eat and to drink? Or do you despise the Church of God and shame those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.", "23": "For I have received from the Lord that which I have also delivered to you; that the Lord Jesus, in the night when he was betrayed, took bread.", "24": "And when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, 'Take. Eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me.'", "25": "Also, in the same way, when He had eaten, He took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the New Testament in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.", "26": "For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death till He comes.", "27": "Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be liable to the body and blood of the Lord.", "28": "Let every man therefore examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup.", "29": "For whoever eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks his own damnation, not discerning the Lord's body.", "30": "For this reason, many among you are weak, and sick, and many sleep.", "31": "For if we were to judge ourselves, we would not be judged.", "32": "But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, because we would not be condemned with the world.", "33": "Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.", "34": "And if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you do not come together to condemnation. I will set other things in order when I come."}

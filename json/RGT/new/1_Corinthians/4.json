{"1": "Let a man so think of us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.", "2": "And as for the rest, it is required of the stewards that everyone be found faithful.", "3": "As for me, however, it is my least concern to be examined by you, or by mankind. I do not even examine myself.", "4": "For though I am aware of nothing against myself, I am not thereby justified. But the One who judges me is the Lord.", "5": "Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, Who will enlighten things that are hidden in darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every man have praise of God.", "6": "Now these things, brothers, I have figuratively applied to my own self and Apollos, for your sakes, that you might learn by us; that no one presumes above that which is written, that no one is puffed up over another.", "7": "For who separates you? And what do you have, that you have not received? If you have received it, why do you boast as though you had not received it?", "8": "Now you are full. Now you are made rich. You reign as kings without us. And I would that you did reign, so that we also might reign with you.", "9": "For I think that God has set us forth, the last Apostles, as men appointed to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, and to the Angels, and to men.", "10": "We are fools for Christ's sake; and you, wise in Christ. We are weak, and you strong. You honorable, and we despised.", "11": "Unto this hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;", "12": "and labor, working with our own hands. We are reviled, and we bless. We are persecuted. We suffer it.", "13": "We are slandered, and we pray. We are made as the filth of the world, the scum of all things, unto this time.", "14": "I do not write these things to shame you. But as my beloved children, I admonish you.", "15": "For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you, through the Gospel.", "16": "Therefore, I encourage you, be followers of me.", "17": "For this cause have I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every Church.", "18": "Now, some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.", "19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the words of those who are puffed up, but the power.", "20": "For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.", "21": "What is your will? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of meekness?"}

Also, no one can say that Jesus is the Lord, except by the Holy Ghost.", "4": "Now, there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.", "5": "And there are diversities of services, but the same Lord.", "6": "And there are diversities of operations, but God is the same Who works all in all.", "7": "Yet the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each, for the profit of all.", "8": "For by the Spirit, the word of wisdom is given to one; and to another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;", "9": "and to another, faith by the same Spirit; and to another, the gifts of healing, by the same Spirit;", "10": "and to another, the operations of miracles; and to another, prophecy; and to another, the discerning of spirits; and to another, diversities of tongues; and to another, the interpretation of tongues.", "11": "Yet, in all these things works one and the same Spirit, distributing to everyone personally, as he will.", "12": "For as the body is one yet has many members; and all the members of the body, though they be many, are one body; even so is Christ.", "13": "For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body - whether Jews or Greeks, whether slave or free - and have all been made to drink of one Spirit.", "14": "For the body is also not one member, but many.", "15": "If the foot would say, 'Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body', is it therefore not of the body?", "16": "And if the ear would say, 'Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body', is it therefore not of the body?", "17": "If the whole body were an eye, where then the hearing? And if the whole were hearing, where then the smelling?", "18": "But now, God has placed the members, every one of them in the body, at His own pleasure.", "19": "For if they were all one member, where is the body?", "20": "But indeed, there are now many members, yet one body.", "21": "Now the eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have no need of you.' Nor again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'", "22": "Yea, but it is much rather those members of the body which seem to be weaker which are necessary.", "23": "And upon those members of the body which we think most dishonorable, we place more honor. And those of us who are indecent are more presentable.", "24": "For the presentable of us have no need. But God has blended the body together, and has given more honor to that which lacked,", "25": "lest there should be any division in the body. So that the members should have the same care one for another.", "26": "Therefore, if one member suffers, all suffer with it. If one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.", "27": "Now you are the body of Christ, and particular members.", "28": "And God has ordained some in the Church: first Apostles, second Prophets, third teachers, then those who do miracles, after that, the gifts of healing, helping, administration, kinds of tongues.", "29": "Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all teachers?", "30": "Are all doers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?", "31": "But desire the better gifts. And still I will show you a more excellent way."}

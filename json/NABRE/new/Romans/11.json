{"1": "The Remnant of Israel.[a] 1\u00a0I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Of course not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. ", "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? ", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.\u201d ", "4": "But what is God's response to him? \u201cI have left for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal.\u201d ", "5": "So also at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. ", "6": "But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. ", "7": "What then? What Israel was seeking it did not attain, but the elect attained it; the rest were hardened, ", "8": "as it is written: \u201cGod gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day.\u201d", "9": "And David says: \u201cLet their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;", "10": "let their eyes grow dim so that they may not see, and keep their backs bent forever.\u201d", "11": "The Gentiles' Salvation. 11\u00a0[b]Hence I ask, did they stumble so as to fall? Of course not! But through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make them jealous. ", "12": "Now if their transgression is enrichment for the world, and if their diminished number is enrichment for the Gentiles, how much more their full number.", "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I glory in my ministry ", "14": "in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of them. ", "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? ", "16": "[c]If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.", "17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place and have come to share in the rich root of the olive tree, ", "18": "do not boast against the branches. If you do boast, consider that you do not support the root; the root supports you. ", "19": "Indeed you will say, \u201cBranches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u201d ", "20": "That is so. They were broken off because of unbelief, but you are there because of faith. So do not become haughty, but stand in awe. ", "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, [perhaps] he will not spare you either. ", "22": "See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness to you, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off. ", "23": "And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. ", "24": "For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated one, how much more will they who belong to it by nature be grafted back into their own olive tree. God's Irrevocable Call.[d] ", "25": "I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not become wise [in] your own estimation: a hardening has come upon Israel in part, until the full number of the Gentiles comes in, ", "26": "and thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \u201cThe deliverer will come out of Zion, he will turn away godlessness from Jacob;", "27": "and this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\u201d", "28": "In respect to the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but in respect to election, they are beloved because of the patriarchs. ", "29": "For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.", "30": "Triumph of God's Mercy. 30\u00a0[e]Just as you once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience, ", "31": "so they have now disobeyed in order that, by virtue of the mercy shown to you, they too may [now] receive mercy.

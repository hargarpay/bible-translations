", "4": "Once more Pilate went out and said to them, \u201cLook, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.\u201d ", "5": "So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, \u201cBehold, the man!\u201d ", "6": "When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, \u201cCrucify him, crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them, \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\u201d ", "7": "[b]The Jews answered, \u201cWe have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\u201d ", "8": "Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid, ", "9": "and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Jesus did not answer him.

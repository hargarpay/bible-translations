A sower went out to sow. ", "4": "And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it up. ", "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. ", "6": "And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots.

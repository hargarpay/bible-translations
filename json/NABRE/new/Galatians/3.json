{"1": "Justification by Faith.[a] 1\u00a0O stupid[b] Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? ", "2": "I want to learn only this from you: did you receive the Spirit from works of the law, or from faith in what you heard?[c] ", "3": "Are you so stupid? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?[d] ", "4": "Did you experience so many things[e] in vain?\u2014if indeed it was in vain. ", "5": "Does, then, the one who supplies the Spirit to you and works mighty deeds among you do so from works of the law or from faith in what you heard? ", "6": "Thus Abraham \u201cbelieved God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\u201d[f]", "7": "[g]Realize then that it is those who have faith who are children of Abraham. ", "8": "Scripture, which saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, foretold the good news to Abraham, saying, \u201cThrough you shall all the nations be blessed.\u201d ", "9": "Consequently, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham who had faith. ", "10": "[h]For all who depend on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, \u201cCursed be everyone who does not persevere in doing all the things written in the book of the law.\u201d ", "11": "And that no one is justified before God by the law is clear, for \u201cthe one who is righteous by faith will live.\u201d ", "12": "But the law does not depend on faith; rather, \u201cthe one who does these things will live by them.\u201d ", "13": "Christ ransomed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, \u201cCursed be everyone who hangs on a tree,\u201d ", "14": "that the blessing of Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.", "15": "The Law Did Not Nullify the Promise. 15\u00a0[i]Brothers, in human terms I say that no one can annul or amend even a human will once ratified. ", "16": "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant.[j] It does not say, \u201cAnd to descendants,\u201d as referring to many, but as referring to one, \u201cAnd to your descendant,\u201d who is Christ. ", "17": "This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward,[k] does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to cancel the promise. ", "18": "For if the inheritance comes from the law, it is no longer from a promise; but God bestowed it on Abraham through a promise.[l]", "19": "[m]Why, then, the law? It was added for transgressions, until the descendant[n] came to whom the promise had been made; it was promulgated by angels at the hand of a mediator. ", "20": "Now there is no mediator when only one party is involved, and God is one. ", "21": "Is the law then opposed to the promises [of God]? Of course not! For if a law had been given that could bring life, then righteousness would in reality come from the law. ", "22": "But scripture confined all things under the power of sin, that through faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe. What Faith Has Brought Us.[o] ", "23": "Before faith came, we were held in custody under law, confined for the faith that was to be revealed. ", "24": "Consequently, the law was our disciplinarian[p] for Christ, that we might be justified by faith. ", "25": "But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a disciplinarian. ", "26": "For through faith you are all children of God[q] in Christ Jesus. ", "27": "[r]For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.[s] ", "28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free person, there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. ", "29": "And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendant, heirs according to the promise."}

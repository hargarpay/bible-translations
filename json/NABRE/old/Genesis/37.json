", "3": "Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons, for he was the child of his old age; and he had made him a long ornamented tunic.[c] ", "4": "When his brothers saw that their father loved him best of all his brothers, they hated him so much that they could not say a kind word to him.", "5": "[d]Once Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers, they hated him even more. ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cListen to this dream I had. ", "7": "There we were, binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf rose to an upright position, and your sheaves formed a ring around my sheaf and bowed down to it.\u201d ", "8": "His brothers said to him, \u201cAre you really going to make yourself king over us? Will you rule over us?\u201d So they hated him all the more because of his dreams and his reports.", "9": "Then he had another dream, and told it to his brothers. \u201cLook, I had another dream,\u201d he said; \u201cthis time, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.\u201d ", "10": "When he told it to his father and his brothers, his father reproved him and asked, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this dream of yours? Can it be that I and your mother and your brothers are to come and bow to the ground before you?\u201d ", "11": "So his brothers were furious at him but his father kept the matter in mind.", "12": "One day, when his brothers had gone to pasture their father's flocks at Shechem, ", "13": "Israel said to Joseph, \u201cAre your brothers not tending our flocks at Shechem?

The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.", "25": "Then they sat down to eat.

{"1": "The Dreams Interpreted. 1\u00a0[a]Some time afterward, the royal cupbearer and baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. ", "2": "Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, ", "3": "and he put them in custody in the house of the chief steward, the same jail where Joseph was confined. ", "4": "The chief steward assigned Joseph to them, and he became their attendant. After they had been in custody for some time, ", "5": "the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt who were confined in the jail both had dreams on the same night, each his own dream and each dream with its own meaning. ", "6": "When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked disturbed. ", "7": "So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in custody in his master's house, \u201cWhy do you look so troubled today?\u201d ", "8": "They answered him, \u201cWe have had dreams, but there is no one to interpret them.\u201d Joseph said to them, \u201cDo interpretations not come from God? Please tell me the dreams.\u201d", "9": "Then the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. \u201cIn my dream,\u201d he said, \u201cI saw a vine in front of me, ", "10": "and on the vine were three branches. It had barely budded when its blossoms came out, and its clusters ripened into grapes.

", "2": "But his sobs were so loud that the Egyptians heard him, and so the news reached Pharaoh's house. ", "3": "\u201cI am Joseph,\u201d he said to his brothers. \u201cIs my father still alive?\u201d But his brothers could give him no answer, so dumbfounded were they at him.", "4": "\u201cCome closer to me,\u201d Joseph told his brothers. When they had done so, he said: \u201cI am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. ", "5": "But now do not be distressed, and do not be angry with yourselves for having sold me here. It was really for the sake of saving lives that God sent me here ahead of you. ", "6": "The famine has been in the land for two years now, and for five more years cultivation will yield no harvest. ", "7": "God, therefore, sent me on ahead of you to ensure for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance.

", "13": "Tell my father all about my high position in Egypt and all that you have seen. But hurry and bring my father down here.\u201d ", "14": "Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept on his shoulder. ", "15": "Joseph then kissed all his brothers and wept over them; and only then were his brothers able to talk with him.", "16": "The news reached Pharaoh's house: \u201cJoseph's brothers have come.\u201d Pharaoh and his officials were pleased. ", "17": "So Pharaoh told Joseph: \u201cSay to your brothers: 'This is what you shall do: Load up your animals and go without delay to the land of Canaan.

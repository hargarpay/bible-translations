", "3": "Then the Lord said to Jacob: Return to the land of your ancestors, where you were born, and I will be with you.", "4": "So Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where his flock was. ", "5": "There he said to them: \u201cI have noticed that your father's attitude toward me is not as it was in the past; but the God of my father has been with me. ", "6": "You know well that with all my strength I served your father; ", "7": "yet your father cheated me and changed my wages ten times. God, however, did not let him do me any harm. ", "8": "Whenever your father said, 'The speckled animals will be your wages,' the entire flock would bear speckled young; whenever he said, 'The streaked animals will be your wages,' the entire flock would bear streaked young. ", "9": "So God took away your father's livestock and gave it to me.

", "11": "In the dream God's angel said to me, 'Jacob!' and I replied, 'Here I am!' ", "12": "Then he said: 'Look up and see. All the he-goats that are mating are streaked, speckled and mottled, for I have seen all the things that Laban has been doing to you. ", "13": "I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a sacred pillar and made a vow to me. Get up now! Leave this land and return to the land of your birth.'\u201d", "14": "Rachel and Leah answered him: \u201cDo we still have an heir's portion in our father's house? ", "15": "Are we not regarded by him as outsiders?[b] He not only sold us; he has even used up the money that he got for us! ", "16": "All the wealth that God took away from our father really belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.\u201d ", "17": "Jacob proceeded to put his children and wives on camels, ", "18": "and he drove off all his livestock and all the property he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.", "19": "Now Laban was away shearing his sheep, and Rachel had stolen her father's household images.[c] ", "20": "Jacob had hoodwinked[d] Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was going to flee.

", "23": "Taking his kinsmen with him, he pursued him for seven days[e] until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.

I would have sent you off with joyful singing to the sound of tambourines and harps. ", "28": "You did not even allow me a parting kiss to my daughters and grandchildren! Now what you have done makes no sense. ", "29": "I have it in my power to harm all of you; but last night the God of your father said to me, 'Take care not to say anything to Jacob!' ", "30": "Granted that you had to leave because you were longing for your father's house, why did you steal my gods?\u201d ", "31": "Jacob replied to Laban, \u201cI was frightened at the thought that you might take your daughters away from me by force. ", "32": "As for your gods, the one you find them with shall not remain alive! If, with our kinsmen looking on, you identify anything here as belonging to you, take it.\u201d Jacob had no idea that Rachel had stolen the household images.", "33": "Laban then went in and searched Jacob's tent and Leah's tent, as well as the tents of the two maidservants; but he did not find them. Leaving Leah's tent, he went into Rachel's. ", "34": "[g]Meanwhile Rachel had taken the household images, put them inside the camel's saddlebag, and seated herself upon them. When Laban had rummaged through her whole tent without finding them, ", "35": "she said to her father, \u201cDo not let my lord be angry that I cannot rise in your presence; I am having my period.\u201d So, despite his search, he did not find the household images.", "36": "Jacob, now angered, confronted Laban and demanded, \u201cWhat crime or offense have I committed that you should hound me? ", "37": "Now that you have rummaged through all my things, what have you found from your household belongings?

", "41": "Of the twenty years that I have now spent in your household, I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, while you changed my wages ten times. ", "42": "If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. But God saw my plight and the fruits of my toil, and last night he reproached you.\u201d", "43": "[i]Laban replied to Jacob: \u201cThe daughters are mine, their children are mine, and the flocks are mine; everything you see belongs to me. What can I do now for my own daughters and for the children they have borne? ", "44": "[j]Come, now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and it will be a treaty between you and me.\u201d", "45": "Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a sacred pillar. ", "46": "Jacob said to his kinsmen, \u201cGather stones.\u201d So they got stones and made a mound; and they ate there at the mound.

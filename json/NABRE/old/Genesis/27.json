{"1": "Jacob's Deception.[a] 1\u00a0When Isaac was so old that his eyesight had failed him, he called his older son Esau and said to him, \u201cMy son!\u201d \u201cHere I am!\u201d he replied. ", "2": "Isaac then said, \u201cNow I have grown old. I do not know when I might die. ", "3": "So now take your hunting gear\u2014your quiver and bow\u2014and go out into the open country to hunt some game for me. ", "4": "Then prepare for me a dish in the way I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you[b] before I die.\u201d", "5": "Rebekah had been listening while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau. So when Esau went out into the open country to hunt some game for his father, ", "6": "Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \u201cListen! I heard your father tell your brother Esau, ", "7": "'Bring me some game and prepare a dish for me to eat, that I may bless you with the Lord's approval before I die.' ", "8": "Now, my son, obey me in what I am about to order you. ", "9": "Go to the flock and get me two choice young goats so that with these I might prepare a dish for your father in the way he likes. ", "10": "Then bring it to your father to eat, that he may bless you before he dies.\u201d ", "11": "But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, \u201cBut my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth-skinned! ", "12": "Suppose my father feels me? He will think I am making fun of him, and I will bring on myself a curse instead of a blessing.\u201d ", "13": "His mother, however, replied: \u201cLet any curse against you, my son, fall on me! Just obey me. Go and get me the young goats.\u201d", "14": "So Jacob went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared a dish in the way his father liked. ", "15": "Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older son Esau that she had in the house, and gave them to her younger son Jacob to wear; ", "16": "and with the goatskins she covered up his hands and the hairless part of his neck. ", "17": "Then she gave her son Jacob the dish and the bread she had prepared.", "18": "Going to his father, Jacob said, \u201cFather!\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d replied Isaac. \u201cWhich of my sons are you?\u201d ", "19": "Jacob answered his father: \u201cI am Esau, your firstborn. I did as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.\u201d ", "20": "But Isaac said to his son, \u201cHow did you get it so quickly, my son?\u201d He answered, \u201cThe Lord, your God, directed me.\u201d ", "21": "Isaac then said to Jacob, \u201cCome closer, my son, that I may feel you, to learn whether you really are my son Esau or not.\u201d ", "22": "So Jacob moved up closer to his father. When Isaac felt him, he said, \u201cAlthough the voice is Jacob's, the hands are Esau's.\u201d ", "23": "(He failed to identify him because his hands were hairy, like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.) ", "24": "Again Isaac said, \u201cAre you really my son Esau?\u201d And Jacob said, \u201cI am.\u201d ", "25": "Then Isaac said, \u201cServe me, my son, and let me eat of the game so that I may bless you.\u201d Jacob served it to him, and Isaac ate; he brought him wine, and he drank. ", "26": "Finally his father Isaac said to him, \u201cCome closer, my son, and kiss me.\u201d ", "27": "As Jacob went up to kiss him, Isaac smelled the fragrance of his clothes. With that, he blessed him, saying, \u201cAh, the fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of a field that the Lord has blessed!", "28": "May God give to you of the dew of the heavens And of the fertility of the earth abundance of grain and wine.", "29": "May peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you; Be master of your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be those who bless you.\u201d", "30": "Jacob had scarcely left his father after Isaac had finished blessing him, when his brother Esau came back from his hunt. ", "31": "Then he too prepared a dish, and bringing it to his father, he said, \u201cLet my father sit up and eat some of his son's game, that you may then give me your blessing.\u201d ", "32": "His father Isaac asked him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d He said, \u201cI am your son, your firstborn son, Esau.\u201d ", "33": "Isaac trembled greatly. \u201cWho was it, then,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all just before you came, and I blessed him. Now he is blessed!\u201d ", "34": "As he heard his father's words, Esau burst into loud, bitter sobbing and said, \u201cFather, bless me too!\u201d ", "35": "When Isaac said, \u201cYour brother came here by a ruse and carried off your blessing,\u201d ", "36": "Esau exclaimed, \u201cHe is well named Jacob, is he not! He has supplanted me[c] twice! First he took away my right as firstborn, and now he has taken away my blessing.\u201d Then he said, \u201cHave you not saved a blessing for me?\u201d ", "37": "Isaac replied to Esau: \u201cI have already appointed him your master, and I have assigned to him all his kindred as his servants; besides, I have sustained him with grain and wine. What then can I do for you, my son?\u201d ", "38": "But Esau said to his father, \u201cHave you only one blessing, father? Bless me too, father!\u201d and Esau wept aloud. ", "39": "His father Isaac said in response: \u201cSee, far from the fertile earth will be your dwelling; far from the dew of the heavens above!", "40": "By your sword you will live, and your brother you will serve; But when you become restless, you will throw off his yoke from your neck.\u201d", "41": "Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. Esau said to himself, \u201cLet the time of mourning for my father come, so that I may kill my brother Jacob.\u201d ", "42": "When Rebekah got news of what her older son Esau had in mind, she summoned her younger son Jacob and said to him: \u201cListen! Your brother Esau intends to get his revenge by killing you. ", "43": "So now, my son, obey me: flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran, ", "44": "and stay with him a while until your brother's fury subsides\u2014 ", "45": "until your brother's anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in a single day?\u201d", "46": "Jacob Sent to Laban. 46\u00a0Rebekah said to Isaac: \u201cI am disgusted with life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob also should marry a Hittite woman, a native of the land, like these women, why should I live?\u201d"}

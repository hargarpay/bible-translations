{"1": "Final Test.[a] 1\u00a0Then Joseph commanded his steward: \u201cFill the men's bags with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his bag. ", "2": "In the mouth of the youngest one's bag put also my silver goblet, together with the money for his grain.\u201d The steward did as Joseph said. ", "3": "At daybreak the men and their donkeys were sent off. ", "4": "They had not gone far out of the city when Joseph said to his steward: \u201cGo at once after the men! When you overtake them, say to them, 'Why did you repay good with evil? Why did you steal my silver goblet? ", "5": "Is it not the very one from which my master drinks and which he uses for divination?[b] What you have done is wrong.'\u201d", "6": "When the steward overtook them and repeated these words to them, ", "7": "they said to him: \u201cWhy does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! ", "8": "We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found in the mouths of our bags. How could we steal silver or gold from your master's house? ", "9": "If any of your servants is found to have the goblet, he shall die, and as for the rest of us, we shall become my lord's slaves.\u201d ", "10": "But he replied, \u201cNow what you propose is fair enough, but only the one who is found to have it shall become my slave, and the rest of you can go free.\u201d ", "11": "Then each of them quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it; ", "12": "and when a search was made, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest, the goblet turned up in Benjamin's bag.

How can we plead or how try to prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt.[c] Here we are, then, the slaves of my lord\u2014the rest of us no less than the one in whose possession the goblet was found.\u201d ", "17": "Joseph said, \u201cFar be it from me to act thus! Only the one in whose possession the goblet was found shall become my slave; the rest of you may go back unharmed to your father.\u201d", "18": "Judah then stepped up to him and said: \u201cI beg you, my lord, let your servant appeal to my lord, and do not become angry with your servant, for you are the equal of Pharaoh.

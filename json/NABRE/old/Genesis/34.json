", "4": "Shechem said to his father Hamor, \u201cGet me this young woman for a wife.\u201d", "5": "Meanwhile, Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah; but since his sons were out in the field with his livestock, Jacob kept quiet until they came home. ", "6": "Now Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to discuss the matter with Jacob, ", "7": "just as Jacob's sons were coming in from the field.

", "15": "Only on this condition will we agree to that: that you become like us by having every male among you circumcised. ", "16": "Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters in marriage; we will settle among you and become one people. ", "17": "But if you do not listen to us and be circumcised, we will take our daughter and go.\u201d", "18": "Their proposal pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.

I have so few men that, if these people unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be wiped out.\u201d ", "31": "But they retorted, \u201cShould our sister be treated like a prostitute?\u201d"}

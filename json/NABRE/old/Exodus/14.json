The wilderness has closed in on them.\u201d ", "4": "I will so harden Pharaoh's heart that he will pursue them. Thus I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. This the Israelites did. ", "5": "When it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart about the people. \u201cWhat in the world have we done!\u201d they said. \u201cWe have released Israel from our service!\u201d ", "6": "So Pharaoh harnessed his chariots and took his army with him. ", "7": "He took six hundred select chariots and all the chariots of Egypt, with officers[b] on all of them. ", "8": "The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites while they were going out in triumph. ", "9": "The Egyptians pursued them\u2014all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, his horsemen,[c] and his army\u2014and caught up with them as they lay encamped by the sea, at Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.", "10": "Crossing the Red Sea. 10\u00a0Now Pharaoh was near when the Israelites looked up and saw that the Egyptians had set out after them. Greatly frightened, the Israelites cried out to the Lord. ", "11": "To Moses they said, \u201cWere there no burial places in Egypt that you brought us to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt? ", "12": "Did we not tell you this in Egypt, when we said, 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? Far better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.\u201d ", "13": "But Moses answered the people, \u201cDo not fear! Stand your ground and see the victory the Lord will win for you today. For these Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.

And the column of cloud, moving from in front of them, took up its place behind them, ", "20": "so that it came between the Egyptian army and that of Israel. And when it became dark, the cloud illumined the night; and so the rival camps did not come any closer together all night long.[e] ", "21": "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind all night long and turned the sea into dry ground. The waters were split, ", "22": "so that the Israelites entered into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water as a wall to their right and to their left.", "23": "Rout of the Egyptians. 23\u00a0The Egyptians followed in pursuit after them\u2014all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen\u2014into the midst of the sea.

The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward it when the Lord cast the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. ", "28": "As the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the horsemen. Of all Pharaoh's army which had followed the Israelites into the sea, not even one escaped. ", "29": "But the Israelites had walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water as a wall to their right and to their left.

When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore ", "31": "and saw the great power that the Lord had shown against Egypt, the people feared the Lord. They believed in the Lord and in Moses his servant."}

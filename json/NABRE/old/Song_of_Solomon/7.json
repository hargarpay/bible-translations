W How can you gaze upon the Shulammite as at the dance of the two camps?", "2": "M How beautiful are your feet in sandals,[b] O noble daughter! Your curving thighs like jewels, the product of skilled hands.", "3": "Your valley,[c] a round bowl that should never lack mixed wine. Your belly, a mound of wheat, encircled with lilies.", "4": "Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.", "5": "Your neck like a tower of ivory; your eyes, pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose like the tower of Lebanon that looks toward Damascus.[d]", "6": "Your head rises upon you like Carmel;[e] your hair is like purple; a king is caught in its locks.", "7": "How beautiful you are, how fair, my love, daughter of delights!", "8": "Your very form resembles a date-palm,[f] and your breasts, clusters.", "9": "I thought, \u201cLet me climb the date-palm!

Let us go out to the fields, let us pass the night among the henna.", "13": "Let us go early to the vineyards, and see if the vines are in bloom, If the buds have opened, if the pomegranates have blossomed; There will I give you my love.", "14": "The mandrakes[i] give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all choice fruits; Fruits both fresh and dried, my lover, have I kept in store for you."}

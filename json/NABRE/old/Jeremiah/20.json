{"1": "Now the priest Pashhur, son of Immer, chief officer in the house of the Lord,[a] heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. ", "2": "So he struck the prophet and put him in the stocks at the upper Gate of Benjamin in the house of the Lord. ", "3": "The next morning, after Pashhur had released Jeremiah from the stocks, the prophet said to him: \u201cInstead of Pashhur, the Lord names you 'Terror on every side.'[b] ", "4": "For thus says the Lord: Indeed, I will hand you over to terror, you and all your friends. Your own eyes shall see them fall by the sword of their enemies. All Judah I will hand over to the power of the king of Babylon,[c] who shall take them captive to Babylon or strike them down with the sword. ", "5": "All the wealth of this city, all its resources and its valuables, all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I will hand over to their enemies, who will plunder it and carry it away to Babylon. ", "6": "You, Pashhur, and all the members of your household shall go into exile. To Babylon you shall go; there you shall die and be buried, you and all your friends, because you have prophesied lies to them.\u201d", "7": "You seduced me,[d] Lord, and I let myself be seduced; you were too strong for me, and you prevailed. All day long I am an object of laughter; everyone mocks me.", "8": "Whenever I speak, I must cry out, violence and outrage I proclaim; The word of the Lord has brought me reproach and derision all day long.", "9": "I say I will not mention him, I will no longer speak in his name. But then it is as if fire is burning in my heart, imprisoned in my bones; I grow weary holding back, I cannot!", "10": "Yes, I hear the whisperings of many: \u201cTerror on every side! Denounce! let us denounce him!\u201d All those who were my friends are on the watch for any misstep of mine. \u201cPerhaps he can be tricked; then we will prevail, and take our revenge on him.\u201d", "11": "But the Lord is with me, like a mighty champion: my persecutors will stumble, they will not prevail. In their failure they will be put to utter shame, to lasting, unforgettable confusion.", "12": "Lord of hosts, you test the just, you see mind and heart, Let me see the vengeance you take on them, for to you I have entrusted my cause.", "13": "Sing to the Lord, praise the Lord, For he has rescued the life of the poor from the power of the evildoers!", "14": "Cursed be the day[e] on which I was born! May the day my mother gave me birth never be blessed!", "15": "Cursed be the one who brought the news to my father, \u201cA child, a son, has been born to you!\u201d filling him with great joy.", "16": "Let that man be like the cities which the Lord relentlessly overthrew; Let him hear war cries in the morning, battle alarms at noonday,", "17": "because he did not kill me in the womb! Then my mother would have been my grave, her womb confining me forever.", "18": "Why did I come forth from the womb, to see sorrow and pain, to end my days in shame?"}

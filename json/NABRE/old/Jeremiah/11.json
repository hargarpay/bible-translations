Then you shall be my people, and I will be your God. ", "5": "Thus I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, the one you have today. \u201cAmen, Lord,\u201d I answered.", "6": "Then the Lord said to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and obey them. ", "7": "I warned your ancestors unceasingly from the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt even to this day: obey my voice. ", "8": "But they did not listen or obey. They each walked in the stubbornness of their evil hearts, till I brought upon them all the threats of this covenant which they had failed to observe as I commanded them.", "9": "A conspiracy has been found, the Lord said to me, among the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ", "10": "They have returned to the crimes of their ancestors who refused to obey my words.

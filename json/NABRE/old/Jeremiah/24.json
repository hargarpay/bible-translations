This was after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled from Jerusalem Jeconiah,[b] son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, the artisans and smiths, and brought them to Babylon. ", "2": "One basket contained excellent figs, those that ripen early. But the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten. ", "3": "Then the Lord said to me: What do you see, Jeremiah? \u201cFigs,\u201d I replied; \u201cthe good ones are very good, but the bad ones very bad, so bad they cannot be eaten.\u201d ", "4": "Thereupon this word of the Lord came to me: ", "5": "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, I will also regard with favor Judah's exiles whom I sent away from this place into the land of the Chaldeans. ", "6": "I will look after them for good and bring them back to this land, to build them up, not tear them down; to plant them, not uproot them.

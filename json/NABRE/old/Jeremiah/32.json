", "4": "Zedekiah, king of Judah, shall not escape the hands of the Chaldeans: he shall indeed be handed over to the king of Babylon. He shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. ", "5": "He shall take Zedekiah to Babylon. There he shall remain, until I attend to him\u2014oracle of the Lord. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you cannot win!\u201d", "6": "[c]Jeremiah said, This word came to me from the Lord: ", "7": "Hanamel, son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you with the offer: \u201cPurchase my field in Anathoth, since you, as nearest relative, have the first right of purchase.\u201d[d] ", "8": "And, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard and said, \u201cPlease purchase my field in Anathoth, in the territory of Benjamin; as nearest relative, you have the first right of possession\u2014purchase it for yourself.\u201d Then I knew this was the word of the Lord.

", "23": "They went in and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice. They did not live by your law; they did not do anything you commanded them to do. Then you made all this evil fall upon them.

What you threatened has happened\u2014you can see it for yourself.

", "33": "They turned their backs to me, not their faces; though I taught them persistently, they would not listen or accept correction. ", "34": "Instead they set up their abominations in the house which bears my name in order to defile it.

Today they lie in ruins uninhabited, ", "3": "because of the evil they did to provoke me, going after other gods, offering incense and serving other gods they did not know, neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors. ", "4": "Though I repeatedly sent you all my servants the prophets, saying: \u201cYou must not commit this abominable deed I hate,\u201d ", "5": "they did not listen or incline their ears in order to turn from their evil, no longer offering incense to other gods. ", "6": "Therefore the fury of my anger poured forth and kindled fire in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, to turn them into the ruined wasteland they are today.", "7": "Now thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why inflict so great an evil upon yourselves, cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant, not leaving yourselves even a remnant?

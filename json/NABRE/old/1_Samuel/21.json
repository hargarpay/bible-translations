Give me five loaves, or whatever you can find.\u201d ", "5": "[b]But the priest replied to David, \u201cI have no ordinary bread on hand, only holy bread; if the men have abstained from women, you may eat some of that.\u201d ", "6": "David answered the priest: \u201cWe have indeed stayed away from women. In the past whenever I went out on a campaign, all the young men were consecrated\u2014even for an ordinary campaign.

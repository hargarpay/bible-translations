I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for from among his sons I have decided on a king.[a] ", "2": "But Samuel replied: \u201cHow can I go? Saul will hear of it and kill me.\u201d To this the Lord answered: Take a heifer along and say, \u201cI have come to sacrifice to the Lord.\u201d ", "3": "Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I myself will tell you what to do; you are to anoint for me the one I point out to you.", "4": "Samuel Anoints David. 4\u00a0Samuel did as the Lord had commanded him.

I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. So purify yourselves and celebrate with me today.\u201d He also had Jesse and his sons purify themselves and invited them to the sacrifice. ", "6": "As they came, he looked at Eliab and thought, \u201cSurely the anointed is here before the Lord.\u201d ", "7": "But the Lord said to Samuel: Do not judge from his appearance or from his lofty stature, because I have rejected him. God does not see as a mortal, who sees the appearance. The Lord looks into the heart.

", "15": "So the servants of Saul said to him: \u201cLook! An evil spirit from God is tormenting you. ", "16": "If your lordship will order it, we, your servants here attending to you, will look for a man skilled in playing the harp. When the evil spirit from God comes upon you, he will play and you will feel better.\u201d ", "17": "Saul then told his servants, \u201cFind me a good harpist and bring him to me.\u201d ", "18": "One of the servants spoke up: \u201cI have observed that a son of Jesse of Bethlehem is a skillful harpist. He is also a brave warrior, an able speaker, and a handsome young man.

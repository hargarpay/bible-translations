", "2": "As the Philistine lords were marching their units of a hundred and a thousand, David and his warriors were marching in the rear guard with Achish. ", "3": "The Philistine commanders asked, \u201cWhat are those Hebrews doing here?\u201d Achish answered them: \u201cWhy, that is David, the officer of Saul, king of Israel. He has been with me for a year or two, and from the day he came over to me until now I have never found fault in him.\u201d ", "4": "But the Philistine commanders were angered at this and said to him: \u201cSend that man back! Let him return to the place you picked out for him. He must not go down into battle with us; during the battle he might become our enemy. For how else can he win back his master's favor, if not at the expense of our soldiers?

But the Philistine commanders are saying, 'He must not go with us into battle.' ", "10": "So the first thing tomorrow, you and your lord's servants who came with you, go to the place I picked out for you. Do not take to heart their worthless remarks; for you have been valuable in my service. But make an early morning start, as soon as it grows light, and be on your way.\u201d ", "11": "So David and his warriors left early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went on up to Jezreel."}

Not finding them there, they continued through the land of Shaalim without success. They also went through the land of Benjamin, but they failed to find the animals. ", "5": "When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, \u201cCome, let us turn back, lest my father forget about the donkeys and become anxious about us.\u201d ", "6": "The servant replied, \u201cListen! There is a man of God in this city, a man held in high esteem; everything he says comes true. Let us go there now! Perhaps he can advise us about the journey we have undertaken.\u201d ", "7": "But Saul said to his servant, \u201cIf we go, what can we offer the man? The food in our bags has run out; we have no present to give the man of God. What else do we have?\u201d ", "8": "Again the servant answered Saul, \u201cI have a quarter shekel of silver.[a] If I give that to the man of God, he will advise us about the journey.\u201d ", "9": "(In former times in Israel, anyone who went to consult God used to say, \u201cCome, let us go to the seer.\u201d For the one who is now called prophet was formerly called seer.)

Hurry now; just today he came to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.[b] ", "13": "When you enter the city, you may reach him before he goes up to the high place to eat.

Go up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me today. In the morning, before letting you go, I will tell you everything on your mind.

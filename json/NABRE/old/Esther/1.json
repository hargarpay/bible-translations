{"1": "Dream of Mordecai. 1\u00a0In the second year of the reign of Ahasuerus the great, on the first day of Nisan, Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream.[a] 2\u00a0[b]He was a Jew residing in the city of Susa, a prominent man who served at the king's court, 3\u00a0and one of the captives whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken from Jerusalem with Jeconiah, king of Judah. This was his dream.[c] There was noise and tumult, thunder and earthquake\u2014confusion upon the earth. 5\u00a0Two great dragons advanced, both poised for combat. They uttered a mighty cry, 6\u00a0and at their cry every nation prepared for war, to fight against the nation of the just. 7\u00a0It was a dark and gloomy day. Tribulation and distress, evil and great confusion, lay upon the earth. 8\u00a0The whole nation of the just was shaken with fear at the evils to come upon them, and they expected to perish. 9\u00a0Then they cried out to God, and from their crying there arose, as though from a tiny spring, a mighty river, a flood of water. 10\u00a0The light of the sun broke forth; the lowly were exalted and they devoured the boastful. Having seen this dream and what God intended to do, Mordecai awoke. He kept it in mind, and tried in every way, until night, to understand its meaning. Mordecai Thwarts an Assassination.[d] 12\u00a0Mordecai lodged in the courtyard with Bigthan and Teresh, two eunuchs of the king who guarded the courtyard. 13\u00a0He overheard them plotting, investigated their plans, and discovered that they were preparing to assassinate King Ahasuerus. So he informed the king about them. 14\u00a0The king had the two eunuchs questioned and, upon their confession, put to death. 15\u00a0Then the king had these things recorded; Mordecai, too, put them into writing. 16\u00a0The king also appointed Mordecai to serve at the court, and rewarded him for his actions. Haman, however, son of Hammedatha, a Bougean,[e] who was held in high honor by the king, sought to harm Mordecai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.

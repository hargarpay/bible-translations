In the morning light you carry it out for it lies within your power.", "2": "[b]You covet fields, and seize them; houses, and take them; You cheat owners of their houses, people of their inheritance.", "3": "Therefore thus says the Lord: Look, I am planning against this family an evil from which you cannot free your necks; Nor shall you walk with head held high, for it will be an evil time.", "4": "On that day you shall be mocked, and there will be bitter lament: \u201cOur ruin is complete, our fields are divided among our captors, The fields of my people are measured out, and no one can get them back!\u201d[c]", "5": "Thus you shall have no one in the assembly of the Lord to allot to you a share of land.", "6": "[d]\u201cDo not preach,\u201d they preach, \u201cno one should preach of these things!

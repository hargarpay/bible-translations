", "3": "But Jonah made ready to flee to Tarshish,[c] away from the Lord. He went down to Joppa, found a ship going to Tarshish, paid the fare, and went down in it to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.", "4": "The Lord, however, hurled a great wind upon the sea, and the storm was so great that the ship was about to break up. ", "5": "Then the sailors were afraid and each one cried to his god. To lighten the ship for themselves, they threw its cargo into the sea. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down into the hold of the ship, and lay there fast asleep. ", "6": "The captain approached him and said, \u201cWhat are you doing asleep? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps this god will be mindful of us so that we will not perish.\u201d", "7": "Then they said to one another, \u201cCome, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come to us.\u201d So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the dense forest is cut down!", "3": "Listen! the wailing of shepherds, their glory has been destroyed. Listen! the roaring of young lions, the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed. The Shepherd Narrative.[a] ", "4": "Thus says the Lord, my God: Shepherd the flock to be slaughtered. ", "5": "For they who buy them slay them and are not held accountable; while those who sell them say, \u201cBlessed be the Lord, I have become rich!\u201d Even their own shepherds will not pity them. ", "6": "For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the earth\u2014oracle of the Lord.\u2014Yes, I will deliver them into each other's power, or into the power of their kings; they will crush the earth, and I will not deliver it out of their power.", "7": "So I shepherded the flock to be slaughtered for the merchants of the flock. I took two staffs: one I called Delight, and the other Union. Thus I shepherded the flock. ", "8": "In a single month, I did away with the three shepherds, for I wearied of them, and they disdained me. ", "9": "\u201cI will not shepherd you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhoever is to die shall die; whoever is to be done away with shall be done away with; and those who are left shall devour one another's flesh.\u201d", "10": "Then I took my staff Delight and snapped it in two, breaking my covenant which I had made with all peoples.

So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the treasury in the house of the Lord. ", "14": "Then I snapped in two my second staff, Union, breaking the kinship between Judah and Israel.", "15": "The Lord said to me: This time take the gear of a foolish shepherd. ", "16": "For I am raising up a shepherd in the land who will take no note of those that disappear, nor seek the strays, nor heal the injured, nor feed the exhausted; but he will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs!", "17": "Ah! my worthless shepherd who forsakes the flock! May the sword fall upon his arm and upon his right eye; His arm will surely wither, and his right eye surely go blind!"}

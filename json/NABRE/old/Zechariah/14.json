", "2": "And I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle: The city will be taken, houses will be plundered, women raped; half the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city. ", "3": "Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, fighting as on a day of battle. ", "4": "On that day God's feet will stand[b] on the Mount of Olives, which is opposite Jerusalem to the east. The Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west by a very deep valley, and half of the mountain will move to the north and half of it to the south. ", "5": "You will flee by the valley between the mountains, for the valley between the mountains will reach to Azal. Thus you will flee as you fled because of the earthquake[c] in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord, my God, will come, and all his holy ones with him.", "6": "Jerusalem Restored. 6\u00a0On that day there will no longer be cold or frost.

", "10": "All the land will turn into a plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, which will stand exalted in its place\u2014from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses. ", "11": "The city will be inhabited; never again will it be doomed. Jerusalem will dwell securely.", "12": "The Fate of Jerusalem's Foes. 12\u00a0And this will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples that have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. ", "13": "On that day a great panic from the Lord will be upon them. They will seize each other's hands, and their hands will be raised against each other.

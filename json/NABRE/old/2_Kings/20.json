", "4": "Before Isaiah had left the central courtyard, the word of the Lord came to him: ", "5": "Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: \u201cThus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Now I am healing you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.", "6": "I will add to your life fifteen years. I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will be a shield to this city for my own sake and the sake of David my servant.\u201d", "7": "Then Isaiah said, \u201cBring a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil for his recovery.\u201d ", "8": "Hezekiah asked Isaiah, \u201cWhat is the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?\u201d ", "9": "Isaiah replied, \u201cThis will be the sign for you from the Lord that he will carry out the word he has spoken: Shall the shadow go forward or back ten steps?\u201d ", "10": "\u201cIt is easy for the shadow to advance ten steps,\u201d Hezekiah answered. \u201cRather, let it go back ten steps.\u201d ", "11": "So Isaiah the prophet invoked the Lord. He made the shadow go back the ten steps it had descended on the staircase to the terrace of Ahaz.", "12": "At that time, Berodach-baladan,[a] son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah when he heard that he had been ill.

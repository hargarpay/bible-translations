{"1": "The Widow's Oil. 1\u00a0A certain woman, the widow of one of the guild prophets, cried out to Elisha: \u201cMy husband, your servant, is dead. You know that he revered the Lord, yet now his creditor has come to take my two children into servitude.\u201d[a] ", "2": "Elisha answered her, \u201cWhat am I to do for you? Tell me what you have in the house.\u201d She replied, \u201cThis servant of yours has nothing in the house but a jug of oil.\u201d ", "3": "He said, \u201cGo out, borrow vessels from all your neighbors\u2014as many empty vessels as you can. ", "4": "Then come back and close the door on yourself and your children; pour the oil into all the vessels, and as each is filled, set it aside.\u201d ", "5": "So she went out. She closed the door on herself and her children and, as they handed her the vessels, she would pour in oil. ", "6": "When all the vessels were filled, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another vessel.\u201d He answered, \u201cThere is none left.\u201d And then the oil stopped. ", "7": "She went and told the man of God, who said, \u201cGo sell the oil to pay off your creditor; with what remains, you and your children can live.\u201d", "8": "Elisha Raises the Shunammite's Son. 8\u00a0One day Elisha came to Shunem, where there was a woman of influence, who pressed him to dine with her. Afterward, whenever he passed by, he would stop there to dine. ", "9": "So she said to her husband, \u201cI know that he is a holy man of God. Since he visits us often, ", "10": "let us arrange a little room on the roof and furnish it for him with a bed, table, chair, and lamp, so that when he comes to us he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "One day Elisha arrived and stayed in the room overnight. ", "12": "Then he said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cCall this Shunammite woman.\u201d He did so, and when she stood before Elisha, ", "13": "he told Gehazi, \u201cSay to her, 'You have troubled yourself greatly for us; what can we do for you? Can we say a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army?'\u201d She replied, \u201cI am living among my own people.\u201d[b] ", "14": "Later Elisha asked, \u201cWhat can we do for her?\u201d Gehazi answered, \u201cShe has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d ", "15": "Elisha said, \u201cCall her.\u201d He did so, and when she stood at the door, ", "16": "Elisha promised, \u201cThis time next year you will be cradling a baby son.\u201d She said, \u201cMy lord, you are a man of God; do not deceive your servant.\u201d ", "17": "Yet the woman conceived, and by the same time the following year she had given birth to a son, as Elisha had promised; ", "18": "and the child grew up healthy. One day the boy went out to his father among the reapers. ", "19": "He said to his father, \u201cMy head! My head!\u201d And his father said to the servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d ", "20": "The servant picked him up and carried him to his mother; he sat in her lap until noon, and then died. ", "21": "She went upstairs and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Closing the door on him, she went out ", "22": "and called to her husband, \u201cLet me have one of the servants and a donkey. I must go quickly to the man of God, and I will be back.\u201d ", "23": "He asked, \u201cWhy are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the sabbath.\u201d But she said, \u201cIt is all right.\u201d ", "24": "When the donkey was saddled, she said to her servant, \u201cLead on! Do not stop my donkey unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "She kept going till she reached the man of God on Mount Carmel. When he saw her at a distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi: \u201cThere is the Shunammite! ", "26": "Hurry to meet her, and ask if everything is all right with her, with her husband, and with the boy.\u201d \u201cEverything is all right,\u201d she replied. ", "27": "But when she reached the man of God on the mountain, she clasped his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the man of God said: \u201cLet her alone, she is in bitter anguish; the Lord hid it from me and did not let me know.\u201d ", "28": "She said, \u201cDid I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, 'Do not mislead me'?\u201d ", "29": "He said to Gehazi, \u201cGet ready for a journey. Take my staff with you and be off; if you meet anyone, give no greeting,[c] and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff upon the boy.\u201d ", "30": "But the boy's mother cried out: \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not release you.\u201d So he started back with her.", "31": "Meanwhile, Gehazi had gone on ahead and had laid the staff upon the boy, but there was no sound, no response. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, \u201cThe boy has not awakened.\u201d ", "32": "When Elisha reached the house, he found the boy dead, lying on the bed. ", "33": "He went in, closed the door on them both, and prayed to the Lord. ", "34": "Then he lay upon the child on the bed, placing his mouth upon the child's mouth, his eyes upon the eyes, and his hands upon the hands. As Elisha stretched himself over the child, the boy's flesh became warm. ", "35": "He arose, paced up and down the room, and then once more stretched himself over him, and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. ", "36": "Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite.\u201d He called her, and she came to him, and Elisha said to her, \u201cTake your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came in and fell at his feet in homage; then she took her son and left.", "38": "The Poisoned Stew. 38\u00a0When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. Once, when the guild prophets were seated before him, he said to his servant, \u201cPut the large pot on, and make some vegetable stew for the guild prophets.\u201d ", "39": "Someone went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine, from which he picked a sackful of poisonous wild gourds. On his return he cut them up into the pot of vegetable stew without anybody's knowing it. ", "40": "The stew was served, but when they began to eat it, they cried, \u201cMan of God, there is death in the pot!\u201d And they could not eat it. ", "41": "He said, \u201cBring some meal.\u201d He threw it into the pot and said, \u201cServe it to the people to eat.\u201d And there was no longer anything harmful in the pot.", "42": "The Barley Loaves. 42\u00a0A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing the man of God twenty barley loaves made from the first fruits, and fresh grain in the ear. Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people to eat.\u201d ", "43": "But his servant objected, \u201cHow can I set this before a hundred?\u201d Elisha again said, \u201cGive it to the people to eat, for thus says the Lord: You will eat and have some left over.\u201d ", "44": "He set it before them, and when they had eaten, they had some left over, according to the word of the Lord."}

", "3": "So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath-haaraloth.[a] ", "4": "This was the reason for the circumcision: Of all the people who had come out of Egypt, every male of military age had died in the wilderness during the journey after they came out of Egypt. ", "5": "Though all the men who came out were circumcised, none of those born in the wilderness during the journey after the departure from Egypt were circumcised. ", "6": "Now the Israelites wandered forty years in the wilderness, until all the warriors among the people that came forth from Egypt died off because they had not listened to the voice of the Lord. For the Lord swore that he would not let them see the land he had sworn to their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

They chose provisions for a journey, making use of old sacks for their donkeys, and old wineskins, torn and mended. ", "5": "They wore old, patched sandals and shabby garments; and all the bread they took was dry and crumbly. ", "6": "Thus they journeyed to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, where they said to him and to the Israelites, \u201cWe have come from a far-off land; now, make a covenant with us.\u201d ", "7": "But the Israelites replied to the Hivites,[a] \u201cYou may be living in land that is ours. How, then, can we make a covenant with you?\u201d ", "8": "But they answered Joshua, \u201cWe are your servants.\u201d Then Joshua asked them, \u201cWho are you? Where do you come from?\u201d ", "9": "They answered him, \u201cYour servants have come from a far-off land, because of the fame of the Lord, your God.

{"1": "[a]Oracle on Tyre: Wail, ships of Tarshish, for your port is destroyed; From the land of the Kittim[b] the news reaches them.", "2": "Silence! you who dwell on the coast, you merchants of Sidon, Whose messengers crossed the sea", "3": "over the deep waters, Whose revenue was the grain of Shihor,[c] the harvest of the Nile, you who were the merchant among the nations.", "4": "Be ashamed, Sidon, fortress on the sea, for the sea[d] has spoken, \u201cI have not been in labor, nor given birth, nor raised young men, nor reared young women.\u201d", "5": "When the report reaches Egypt they shall be in anguish at the report about Tyre.", "6": "Pass over to Tarshish,[e] wail, you who dwell on the coast!", "7": "Is this your exultant city, whose origin is from old, Whose feet have taken her to dwell in distant lands?", "8": "Who has planned such a thing against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, Whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the earth's honored men?", "9": "The Lord of hosts has planned it, to disgrace the height of all beauty, to degrade all the honored of the earth.", "10": "Cross to your own land, ship of Tarshish; the harbor is no more.", "11": "His hand he stretches out over the sea, he shakes kingdoms; The Lord commanded the destruction of Canaan's strongholds:[f]", "12": "Crushed, you shall exult no more, virgin daughter Sidon.

At the end of seventy years, the song about the prostitute will be Tyre's song:", "16": "Take a harp, go about the city, forgotten prostitute; Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.", "17": "At the end of the seventy years the Lord shall visit Tyre. She shall return to her hire and serve as prostitute[i] with all the world's kingdoms on the face of the earth. ", "18": "But her merchandise and her hire shall be sacred to the Lord. It shall not be stored up or laid away; instead, her merchandise shall belong to those who dwell before the Lord, to eat their fill and clothe themselves in choice attire."}

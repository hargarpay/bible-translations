{"1": "The wilderness and the parched land will exult; the Arabah will rejoice and bloom;", "2": "Like the crocus it shall bloom abundantly, and rejoice with joyful song. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; They will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.", "3": "Strengthen hands that are feeble, make firm knees that are weak,", "4": "Say to the fearful of heart: Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God, he comes with vindication; With divine recompense he comes to save you.", "5": "Then the eyes of the blind shall see, and the ears of the deaf be opened;", "6": "Then the lame shall leap like a stag, and the mute tongue sing for joy. For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the Arabah.", "7": "The burning sands will become pools, and the thirsty ground, springs of water; The abode where jackals crouch will be a marsh for the reed and papyrus.", "8": "A highway will be there, called the holy way; No one unclean may pass over it, but it will be for his people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray on it.", "9": "No lion shall be there, nor any beast of prey approach, nor be found. But there the redeemed shall walk,", "10": "And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and enter Zion singing, crowned with everlasting joy; They meet with joy and gladness, sorrow and mourning flee away."}

{"1": "Raise a glad cry, you barren one[a] who never bore a child, break forth in jubilant song, you who have never been in labor, For more numerous are the children of the deserted wife than the children of her who has a husband, says the Lord.", "2": "Enlarge the space for your tent, spread out your tent cloths unsparingly; lengthen your ropes and make firm your pegs.", "3": "For you shall spread abroad to the right and left; your descendants shall dispossess the nations and shall people the deserted cities.[b]", "4": "[c]Do not fear, you shall not be put to shame; do not be discouraged, you shall not be disgraced. For the shame of your youth you shall forget, the reproach of your widowhood no longer remember.", "5": "For your husband is your Maker; the Lord of hosts is his name, Your redeemer,[d] the Holy One of Israel, called God of all the earth.", "6": "The Lord calls you back, like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, A wife married in youth and then cast off, says your God.", "7": "For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great tenderness I will take you back.", "8": "In an outburst of wrath, for a moment I hid my face from you; But with enduring love I take pity on you, says the Lord, your redeemer.", "9": "This is for me like the days of Noah: As I swore then that the waters of Noah should never again flood the earth, So I have sworn now not to be angry with you, or to rebuke you.", "10": "Though the mountains fall away and the hills be shaken, My love shall never fall away from you nor my covenant of peace[e] be shaken, says the Lord, who has mercy on you.", "11": "O afflicted one,[f] storm-battered and unconsoled, I lay your pavements in carnelians, your foundations in sapphires;", "12": "I will make your battlements of rubies, your gates of jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.", "13": "All your children shall be taught by the Lord; great shall be the peace of your children.", "14": "In justice shall you be established, far from oppression, you shall not fear, from destruction, it cannot come near.", "15": "If there be an attack, it is not my doing; whoever attacks shall fall before you.", "16": "See, I have created the smith who blows on the burning coals and forges weapons as his work; It is I also who have created the destroyer to work havoc.", "17": "Every weapon fashioned against you shall fail; every tongue that brings you to trial you shall prove false. This is the lot of the servants of the Lord, their vindication from me\u2014oracle of the Lord."}

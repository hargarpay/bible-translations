They have forsaken the Lord, spurned the Holy One of Israel, apostatized,", "5": "Why[e] would you yet be struck, that you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint.", "6": "From the sole of the foot to the head there is no sound spot in it; Just bruise and welt and oozing wound, not drained, or bandaged, or eased with salve.", "7": "Your country is waste, your cities burnt with fire; Your land\u2014before your eyes strangers devour it, a waste, like the devastation of Sodom.[f]", "8": "And daughter Zion[g] is left like a hut in a vineyard, Like a shed in a melon patch, like a city blockaded.", "9": "If the Lord of hosts[h] had not left us a small remnant, We would have become as Sodom, would have resembled Gomorrah.", "10": "[i]Hear the word of the Lord, princes of Sodom!

Your hands are full of blood![j]", "16": "Wash yourselves clean! Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes; cease doing evil;", "17": "learn to do good. Make justice your aim: redress the wronged, hear the orphan's plea, defend the widow.", "18": "Come now, let us set things right,[k] says the Lord: Though your sins be like scarlet, they may become white as snow; Though they be red like crimson, they may become white as wool.", "19": "If you are willing, and obey, you shall eat the good things of the land;", "20": "But if you refuse and resist, you shall be eaten by the sword: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken!", "21": "How she has become a prostitute, the faithful city,[l] so upright! Justice used to lodge within her, but now, murderers.", "22": "Your silver is turned to dross, your wine is mixed with water.", "23": "Your princes are rebels and comrades of thieves; Each one of them loves a bribe and looks for gifts.

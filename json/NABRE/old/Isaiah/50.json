{"1": "Thus says the Lord: Where is the bill of divorce with which I dismissed your mother?[a] Or to which of my creditors have I sold you? It was for your sins you were sold, for your rebellions your mother was dismissed.", "2": "Why was no one there when I came? Why did no one answer when I called?[b] Is my hand too short to ransom? Have I not the strength to deliver? See, with my rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into wilderness; Their fish rot for lack of water, and die of thirst.", "3": "I clothe the heavens in black, and make sackcloth their covering.", "4": "[c]The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue, That I might know how to answer the weary a word that will waken them. Morning after morning he wakens my ear to hear as disciples do;", "5": "The Lord God opened my ear; I did not refuse, did not turn away.[d]", "6": "I gave my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who tore out my beard;[e] My face I did not hide from insults and spitting.", "7": "The Lord God is my help, therefore I am not disgraced; Therefore I have set my face like flint, knowing that I shall not be put to shame.", "8": "He who declares my innocence is near. Who will oppose me? Let us appear together. Who will dispute my right? Let them confront me.", "9": "See, the Lord God is my help; who will declare me guilty? See, they will all wear out like a garment, consumed by moths.", "10": "Who among you fears the Lord,[f] heeds his servant's voice? Whoever walk in darkness, without any light, Yet trust in the name of the Lord and rely upon their God!", "11": "All you who kindle flames and set flares alight, Walk by the light of your own fire and by the flares you have burnt! This is your fate from my hand: you shall lie down in a place of torment."}

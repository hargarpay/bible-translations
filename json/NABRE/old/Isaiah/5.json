{"1": "Now let me sing of my friend, my beloved's song about his vineyard. My friend had a vineyard on a fertile hillside;", "2": "He spaded it, cleared it of stones, and planted the choicest vines; Within it he built a watchtower, and hewed out a wine press. Then he waited for the crop of grapes, but it yielded rotten grapes.", "3": "Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem, people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard:", "4": "What more could be done for my vineyard that I did not do? Why, when I waited for the crop of grapes, did it yield rotten grapes?", "5": "Now, I will let you know what I am going to do to my vineyard: Take away its hedge, give it to grazing, break through its wall, let it be trampled![b]", "6": "Yes, I will make it a ruin: it shall not be pruned or hoed, but will be overgrown with thorns and briers; I will command the clouds not to rain upon it.", "7": "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, the people of Judah, his cherished plant; He waited for judgment, but see, bloodshed! for justice, but hark, the outcry![c]", "8": "[e]Ah! Those who join house to house, who connect field with field, Until no space remains, and you alone dwell in the midst of the land!", "9": "In my hearing the Lord of hosts has sworn: Many houses shall be in ruins, houses large and fine, with nobody living there.", "10": "Ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath,[f] And a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.", "11": "[g]Ah! Those who rise early in the morning in pursuit of strong drink, lingering late inflamed by wine,", "12": "Banqueting on wine with harp and lyre, timbrel and flute, But the deed of the Lord they do not regard, the work of his hands they do not see!", "13": "Therefore my people go into exile for lack of understanding, Its nobles starving, its masses parched with thirst.", "14": "Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat and opens its mouth beyond measure; Down into it go nobility and masses, tumult and revelry.", "15": "All shall be abased, each one brought low, and the eyes of the haughty lowered,", "16": "But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted by judgment, by justice the Holy God shown holy.", "17": "Lambs shall graze as at pasture, young goats shall eat in the ruins of the rich.", "18": "Ah! Those who tug at guilt with cords of perversity, and at sin as if with cart ropes!", "19": "[h]Who say, \u201cLet him make haste, let him speed his work, that we may see it; On with the plan of the Holy One of Israel! let it come to pass, that we may know it!\u201d", "20": "Ah! Those who call evil good, and good evil, who change darkness to light, and light into darkness, who change bitter to sweet, and sweet into bitter!", "21": "Ah! Those who are wise in their own eyes, prudent in their own view!", "22": "Ah! Those who are champions at drinking wine, masters at mixing drink!", "23": "Those who acquit the guilty for bribes, and deprive the innocent of justice!", "24": "Therefore, as the tongue of fire licks up stubble, as dry grass shrivels in the flame, Their root shall rot and their blossom scatter like dust; For they have rejected the instruction of the Lord of hosts, and scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel.", "25": "[i]Therefore the wrath of the Lord blazes against his people, he stretches out his hand to strike them; The mountains quake, their corpses shall be like refuse in the streets. For all this, his wrath is not turned back, his hand is still outstretched.", "26": "He will raise a signal to a far-off nation, and whistle for it from the ends of the earth. Then speedily and promptly they will come.", "27": "None among them is weary, none stumbles, none will slumber, none will sleep. None with waist belt loose, none with sandal thong broken.", "28": "Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent, The hooves of their horses like flint, and their chariot wheels like the whirlwind.", "29": "They roar like the lion, like young lions, they roar; They growl and seize the prey, they carry it off and none can rescue.", "30": "They will growl over it, on that day, like the growling of the sea, Look to the land\u2014 darkness closing in, the light dark with clouds!"}

Through the distressed and troubled land[d] of the lioness and roaring lion, of the viper and flying saraph, They carry their riches on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels To a people good for nothing,", "7": "to Egypt whose help is futile and vain. Therefore I call her \u201cRahab[e] Sit-still.\u201d", "8": "[f]Now come, write it on a tablet they can keep, inscribe it on a scroll; That in time to come it may be an eternal witness.", "9": "For this is a rebellious people, deceitful children, Children who refuse to listen to the instruction of the Lord;", "10": "Who say to the seers, \u201cDo not see\u201d; to the prophets,[g] \u201cDo not prophesy truth for us; speak smooth things to us, see visions that deceive!", "11": "Turn aside from the way!

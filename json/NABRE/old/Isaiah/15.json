{"1": "Oracle on Moab: Laid waste in a night, Ar of Moab is destroyed; Laid waste in a night, Kir of Moab is destroyed.", "2": "Daughter Dibon has gone up to the high places to weep; Over Nebo and over Medeba Moab is wailing. Every head is shaved, every beard sheared off.[b]", "3": "In the streets they wear sackcloth, and on the rooftops; In the squares everyone wails, streaming with tears.", "4": "Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, they are heard as far as Jahaz. At this the loins of Moab tremble, his soul quivers within him;", "5": "My heart cries out for Moab, his fugitives reach Zoar, Eglath-shelishiyah: The ascent of Luhith they ascend weeping; On the way to Horonaim they utter rending cries;", "6": "The waters of Nimrim have become a waste, The grass is withered, new growth is gone, nothing is green.", "7": "So now whatever they have acquired or stored away they carry across the Wadi of the Poplars.", "8": "The cry has gone round the territory of Moab; As far as Eglaim his wailing, even at Beer-elim his wailing.", "9": "[c]The waters of Dimon are filled with blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon: Lions for those who are fleeing from Moab and for those who remain in the land!"}

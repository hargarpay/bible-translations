", "2": "He removed the illicit altars and the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the asherahs. ", "3": "He told Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to observe the law and the commandment. ", "4": "He removed the high places and incense stands from all the cities of Judah, and under him the kingdom had peace. ", "5": "He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had peace and no war was waged against him during these years, because the Lord had given him rest. ", "6": "He said to Judah: \u201cLet us build these cities and surround them with walls, towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, for we have sought the Lord, our God; we sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.\u201d So they built and prospered.

", "14": "They also attacked the tents of the cattle-herders and carried off a great number of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem."}

The field she entered to glean after the harvesters happened to be the section belonging to Boaz, of the clan of Elimelech. ", "4": "[c]Soon, along came Boaz from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, \u201cThe Lord be with you,\u201d and they replied, \u201cThe Lord bless you.\u201d ", "5": "Boaz asked the young man overseeing his harvesters, \u201cWhose young woman is this?\u201d ", "6": "The young man overseeing the harvesters answered, \u201cShe is the young Moabite who came back with Naomi from the plateau of Moab. ", "7": "[d]She said, 'I would like to gather the gleanings into sheaves after the harvesters.' Ever since she came this morning she has remained here until now, with scarcely a moment's rest.\u201d", "8": "Boaz then spoke to Ruth, \u201cListen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in anyone else's field; you are not to leave here. Stay here with my young women. ", "9": "Watch to see which field is to be harvested, and follow them. Have I not commanded the young men to do you no harm?

May you receive a full reward from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.\u201d ", "13": "She said, \u201cMay I prove worthy of your favor, my lord. You have comforted me. You have spoken to the heart of your servant[e]\u2014and I am not even one of your servants!\u201d ", "14": "At mealtime Boaz said to her, \u201cCome here and have something to eat; dip your bread in the sauce.\u201d Then as she sat near the harvesters, he handed her some roasted grain and she ate her fill and had some left over.

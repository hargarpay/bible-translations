", "5": "His wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, \u201cWhy are you so sullen that you will not eat?\u201d ", "6": "He answered her, \u201cBecause I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Sell me your vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in exchange.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'\u201d ", "7": "Jezebel his wife said to him, \u201cWhat a king of Israel you are! Get up! Eat and be cheerful.

Be strong and be a man! ", "3": "Keep the mandate of the Lord, your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, commands, ordinances, and decrees as they are written in the law of Moses, that you may succeed in whatever you do, and wherever you turn, ", "4": "and that the Lord may fulfill the word he spoke concerning me: If your sons so conduct themselves that they walk before me in faithfulness with their whole heart and soul, there shall never be wanting someone of your line on the throne of Israel.", "5": "[a]\u201cYou yourself know what Joab, son of Zeruiah, did to me\u2014what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner, son of Ner, and Amasa, son of Jether: he killed them and brought the blood of war into a time of peace, and put the blood of war on the belt about his waist and the sandal on his foot. ", "6": "Act with all the wisdom you possess; do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. ", "7": "But be true to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and have them among those who eat at your table. For they were loyal to me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom. ", "8": "You also have with you Shimei, son of Gera, the Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me bitterly the day I was going to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord: 'I will not kill you by the sword.' ", "9": "But you must not let him go unpunished. You are wise; you will know what to do to send his gray head down to Sheol in blood.\u201d", "10": "David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David.

But the kingship passed me by and went to my brother; by the Lord's will it went to him. ", "16": "But now there is one favor I would ask of you. Do not refuse me.\u201d And she said, \u201cSpeak on.\u201d ", "17": "[c]He said, \u201cPlease ask King Solomon, who will not refuse you, to give me Abishag the Shunamite to be my wife.\u201d ", "18": "Bathsheba replied, \u201cVery well, I will speak to the king for you.\u201d", "19": "Then Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, and the king stood up to meet her and paid her homage.

Do not refuse me.\u201d The king said to her, \u201cAsk it, my mother, for I will not refuse you.\u201d ", "21": "So she said, \u201cLet Abishag the Shunamite be given to your brother Adonijah to be his wife.\u201d ", "22": "King Solomon answered his mother, \u201cAnd why do you ask that Abishag the Shunamite be given to Adonijah? Ask the kingship for him as well, for he is my older brother! Ask for him, for Abiathar the priest, for Joab, son of Zeruiah!\u201d ", "23": "And King Solomon swore by the Lord: \u201cMay God do thus to me and more, if Adonijah has not spoken this word at the cost of his life. ", "24": "And now, as the Lord lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father and made for me a house as he promised, this day shall Adonijah be put to death.\u201d ", "25": "Then King Solomon sent Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, who struck him dead.", "26": "The king said to Abiathar the priest: \u201cGo to your estate in Anathoth. Though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father and shared in all the hardships my father endured.\u201d[d] ", "27": "So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from the office of priest of the Lord, thus fulfilling the word the Lord had spoken in Shiloh against the house of Eli.", "28": "When the news came to Joab, since he had sided with Adonijah, though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the Lord and clung to the horns of the altar.

I will die here.\u201d Benaiah reported to the king, \u201cThis is what Joab said to me in reply.\u201d ", "31": "The king answered him: \u201cDo as he has said. Strike him down and bury him, and remove from me and from my father's house the blood which Joab shed without provocation. ", "32": "The Lord will bring blood upon his own head, because he struck down two men better and more just than himself, and slew them with the sword without my father David's knowledge: Abner, son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa, son of Jether, commander of Judah's army. ", "33": "Their blood will be upon the head of Joab and his descendants. But upon David and his descendants, upon his house and his throne, there shall be peace forever from the Lord.\u201d ", "34": "Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, went back, struck him down and killed him; he was buried in his house in the wilderness. ", "35": "The king appointed Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, over the army in his place; Zadok the priest the king put in place of Abiathar.", "36": "Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him: \u201cBuild yourself a house in Jerusalem and stay there. Do not go anywhere else. ", "37": "For the day you leave, and cross the Wadi Kidron, be certain you shall surely die. Your blood shall be upon your own head.\u201d ", "38": "Shimei answered the king: \u201cI accept.

And you answered, 'I accept and obey.'[e] ", "43": "Why, then, have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the command that I gave you?\u201d ", "44": "And the king said to Shimei: \u201cIn your heart you know very well the evil that you did to David my father. Now the Lord is bringing your own evil upon your head.

And the royal power was established in Solomon's hand."}

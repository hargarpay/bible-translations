When they grew up the sons of the wife had driven Jephthah away, saying to him, \u201cYou shall inherit nothing in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman.\u201d ", "3": "So Jephthah had fled from his brothers and taken up residence in the land of Tob. Worthless men had joined company with him, and went out with him on raids.", "4": "Some time later, the Ammonites went to war with Israel. ", "5": "As soon as the Ammonites were at war with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob. ", "6": "\u201cCome,\u201d they said to Jephthah, \u201cbe our commander so that we can fight the Ammonites.\u201d ", "7": "\u201cAre you not the ones who hated me and drove me from my father's house?\u201d Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, \u201cWhy do you come to me now, when you are in distress?\u201d ", "8": "The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cThis is the reason we have come back to you now: if you go with us to fight against the Ammonites, you shall be the leader of all of the inhabitants of Gilead.\u201d ", "9": "Jephthah answered the elders of Gilead, \u201cIf you bring me back to fight against the Ammonites and the Lord delivers them up to me, I will be your leader.\u201d ", "10": "The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cThe Lord is witness between us that we will do as you say.\u201d ", "11": "So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the army made him their leader and commander. Jephthah gave all his orders in the presence of the Lord in Mizpah.", "12": "Then he sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites to say, \u201cWhat do you have against me that you come to fight with me in my land?\u201d ", "13": "The king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, \u201cIsrael took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the Jordan when they came up from Egypt. Now restore it peaceably.\u201d", "14": "Again Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, ", "15": "saying to him, \u201cThis is what Jephthah says: 'Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.

", "17": "Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom saying, \u201cLet me pass through your land.\u201d But the king of Edom did not give consent. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he too was unwilling. So Israel remained in Kadesh. ", "18": "Then they went through the wilderness, and bypassing the land of Edom and the land of Moab, they arrived east of the land of Moab and encamped across the Arnon. Thus they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab. ", "19": "Then Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon, who was king of Heshbon. Israel said to him, \u201cLet me pass through your land to my own place.\u201d ", "20": "But Sihon refused to let Israel pass through his territory. He gathered all his soldiers, and they encamped at Jahaz and fought Israel.

", "22": "They occupied all of the Amorite territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the wilderness to the Jordan. ", "23": "Now, then, it was the Lord, the God of Israel, who dispossessed the Amorites for his people, Israel. And you are going to dispossess them? ", "24": "Should you not take possession of that which your god Chemosh[a] gave you to possess, and should we not take possession of all that the Lord, our God, has dispossessed for us? ", "25": "Now, then, are you any better than Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or make war against them? ", "26": "Israel has dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, Aroer and its villages, and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon for three hundred years. Why did you not recover them during that time? ", "27": "As for me, I have not sinned against you, but you wrong me by making war against me. Let the Lord, who is judge, decide this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites!'\u201d ", "28": "But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to the message Jephthah sent him.", "29": "Jephthah's Vow. 29\u00a0The spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah. He passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and through Mizpah of Gilead as well, and from Mizpah of Gilead he crossed over against the Ammonites.

", "33": "He inflicted a very severe defeat on them from Aroer to the approach of Minnith\u2014twenty cities in all\u2014and as far as Abel-keramin. So the Ammonites were brought into subjection by the Israelites.

She was his only child: he had neither son nor daughter besides her. ", "35": "When he saw her, he tore his garments and said, \u201cAh, my daughter! You have struck me down and brought calamity upon me.

Do nothing for two months, that I and my companions may go wander in the mountains to weep for my virginity.\u201d ", "38": "\u201cGo,\u201d he replied, and sent her away for two months. So she departed with her companions and wept for her virginity in the mountains. ", "39": "At the end of the two months she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She had not had relations with any man. It became a custom in Israel ", "40": "for Israelite women to go yearly to mourn the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days of the year."}

", "2": "The people of Gaza were told, \u201cSamson has come here,\u201d and they surrounded him with an ambush at the city gate all night long. And all the night they waited, saying, \u201cAt morning light we will kill him.\u201d ", "3": "Samson lay there until midnight. Then he rose at midnight, seized the doors of the city gate and the two gateposts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He hoisted them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the ridge opposite Hebron.", "4": "Samson and Delilah. 4\u00a0After that he fell in love with a woman in the Wadi Sorek whose name was Delilah. ", "5": "The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said, \u201cTrick him and find out where he gets his great strength, and how we may overcome and bind him so as to make him helpless. Then for our part, we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.\u201d", "6": "So Delilah said to Samson, \u201cTell me where you get your great strength and how you may be bound so as to be made helpless.\u201d ", "7": "\u201cIf they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not dried,\u201d Samson answered her, \u201cI shall grow weaker and be like anyone else.\u201d ", "8": "So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not dried, and she bound him with them. ", "9": "She had men lying in wait in the room, and she said to him, \u201cThe Philistines are upon you, Samson!\u201d But he snapped the bowstrings as a thread of tow is snapped by a whiff of flame; and his strength remained unexplained.", "10": "Delilah said to Samson, \u201cYou have mocked me and told me lies. Now tell me how you may be bound.\u201d ", "11": "\u201cIf they bind me tight with new ropes, with which no work has been done,\u201d he answered her, \u201cI shall grow weaker and be like anyone else.\u201d ", "12": "So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them. Then she said to him, \u201cThe Philistines are upon you, Samson!\u201d For there were men lying in wait in the room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread.", "13": "Delilah said to Samson again, \u201cUp to now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you may be bound.\u201d He said to her, \u201cIf you weave the seven locks of my hair into the web and fasten them with the pin, I shall grow weaker and be like anyone else.\u201d ", "14": "So when he went to bed, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web, and fastened them with the pin. Then she said, \u201cThe Philistines are upon you, Samson!\u201d Awakening from his sleep, he pulled out both the loom and the web.", "15": "Then she said to him, \u201cHow can you say 'I love you' when your heart is not mine? Three times already you have mocked me, and not told me where you get your great strength!\u201d ", "16": "She pressed him continually and pestered him till he was deathly weary of it. ", "17": "So he told her all that was in his heart and said, \u201cNo razor has touched my head, for I have been a nazirite for God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I shall grow weaker and be like anyone else.\u201d ", "18": "When Delilah realized that he had told her all that was in his heart, she summoned the lords of the Philistines, saying, \u201cCome up this time, for he has told me all that is in his heart.\u201d So the lords of the Philistines came to her and brought the money with them. ", "19": "She put him to sleep on her lap, and called for a man who shaved off the seven locks of his hair. He immediately became helpless, for his strength had left him.[a] ", "20": "When she said \u201cThe Philistines are upon you, Samson!\u201d he woke from his sleep and thought, \u201cI will go out as I have done time and again and shake myself free.\u201d He did not realize that the Lord had left him. ", "21": "But the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. Then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze fetters, and he was put to grinding grain in the prison. ", "22": "But the hair of his head began to grow as soon as it was shaved.", "23": "The Death of Samson. 23\u00a0The lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon[b] and to celebrate. They said, \u201cOur god has delivered Samson our enemy into our power.\u201d ", "24": "When the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, \u201cOur god has delivered into our power our enemy, the ravager of our land, the one who has multiplied our slain.\u201d", "25": "When their spirits were high, they said, \u201cCall Samson that he may amuse us.\u201d So they called Samson from the prison, and he provided amusement for them. They made him stand between the columns, ", "26": "and Samson said to the attendant who was holding his hand, \u201cPut me where I may touch the columns that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.\u201d ", "27": "The temple was full of men and women: all the lords of the Philistines were there, and from the roof about three thousand men and women looked on as Samson provided amusement. ", "28": "Samson cried out to the Lord and said, \u201cLord God, remember me! Strengthen me only this once that I may avenge myself on the Philistines at one blow for my two eyes.\u201d ", "29": "Samson grasped the two middle columns on which the temple rested and braced himself against them, one at his right, the other at his left. ", "30": "Then saying, \u201cLet me die with the Philistines!\u201d Samson pushed hard, and the temple fell upon the lords and all the people who were in it. Those he killed by his dying were more than those he had killed during his lifetime.", "31": "His kinsmen and all his father's house went down and bore him up for burial in the grave of Manoah his father between Zorah and Eshtaol. He had judged Israel for twenty years."}

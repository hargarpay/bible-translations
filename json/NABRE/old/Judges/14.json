Get her for me as a wife.\u201d ", "3": "His father and mother said to him, \u201cIs there no woman among your kinsfolk or among all your people, that you must go and take a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?\u201d But Samson answered his father, \u201cGet her for me, for she is the one I want.\u201d ", "4": "Now his father and mother did not know that this had been brought about by the Lord, who was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines;[a] for at that time they ruled over Israel.", "5": "So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother. When he turned aside to the vineyards of Timnah, a young lion came roaring out toward him. ", "6": "But the spirit of the Lord rushed upon Samson, and he tore the lion apart barehanded, as one tears a young goat. Without telling his father or mother what he had done, ", "7": "he went down and spoke to the woman. He liked her. ", "8": "Later, when he came back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the remains of the lion, and there was a swarm of bees in the lion's carcass, and honey.

{"1": "[a]It shall come to pass I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.", "2": "Even upon your male and female servants, in those days, I will pour out my spirit.", "3": "I will set signs in the heavens and on the earth, blood, fire, and columns of smoke;", "4": "The sun will darken, the moon turn blood-red, Before the day of the Lord arrives, that great and terrible day.", "5": "Then everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will escape harm. For on Mount Zion there will be a remnant, as the Lord has said, And in Jerusalem survivors whom the Lord will summon."}

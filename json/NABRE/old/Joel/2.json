Nothing like it has ever happened in ages past, nor will the future hold anything like it, even to the most distant generations.", "3": "Before it,[c] fire devours, behind it flame scorches. The land before it is like the garden of Eden, and behind it, a desolate wilderness; from it nothing escapes.", "4": "Their appearance is that of horses; like war horses they run.", "5": "Like the rumble of chariots they hurtle across mountaintops; Like the crackling of fiery flames devouring stubble; Like a massive army in battle formation.", "6": "Before them peoples tremble, every face turns pale.", "7": "Like warriors they run, like soldiers they scale walls, Each advancing in line, without swerving from the course.", "8": "No one crowds the other; each advances in its own track; They plunge through the weapons; they are not checked.", "9": "They charge the city, they run upon the wall, they climb into the houses; Through the windows they enter like thieves.", "10": "Before them the earth trembles; the heavens shake; Sun and moon are darkened, and the stars withhold their brightness.", "11": "The Lord raises his voice at the head of his army; How immense is his host! How numerous those who carry out his command! How great is the day of the Lord! Utterly terrifying!

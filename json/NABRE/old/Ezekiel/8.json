The spirit lifted me up[c] between earth and heaven and brought me in divine vision to Jerusalem to the entrance of the inner gate facing north where the statue of jealousy that provokes jealousy stood. ", "4": "There I saw the glory of the God of Israel, like the vision I had seen in the plain. ", "5": "He said to me: Son of man, lift your eyes to the north! I looked to the north and there in the entry north of the altar gate was this statue of jealousy. ", "6": "He asked, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? Do you see the great abominations that the house of Israel is practicing here, so that I must depart from my sanctuary? You shall see even greater abominations!", "7": "Then he brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and there I saw a hole in the wall. ", "8": "Son of man, he ordered, dig through the wall. I dug through the wall\u2014there was a doorway. ", "9": "Go in, he said to me, and see the evil abominations they are doing here.

She made her lair among young lions, to raise her cubs;", "3": "One cub she raised up, a young lion he became; He learned to tear apart prey, he devoured people.", "4": "Nations heard about him; in their pit he was caught; They took him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.[b]", "5": "When she realized she had waited in vain, she lost hope. She took another of her cubs, and made him a young lion.", "6": "He prowled among the lions, became a young lion; He learned to tear apart prey, he devoured people.", "7": "He ravaged their strongholds, laid waste their cities. The earth and everything in it were terrified at the sound of his roar.", "8": "Nations laid out against him snares all around; They spread their net for him, in their pit he was caught.", "9": "They put him in fetters and took him away to the king of Babylon, So his roar would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.", "10": "Your mother was like a leafy vine[c] planted by water, Fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.", "11": "One strong branch grew into a royal scepter. So tall it towered among the clouds, conspicuous in height, with dense foliage.", "12": "But she was torn out in fury and flung to the ground; The east wind withered her up, her fruit was plucked away; Her strongest branch dried up, fire devoured it.", "13": "Now she is planted in a wilderness, in a dry, parched land.", "14": "Fire flashed from her branch, and devoured her shoots; Now she does not have a strong branch, a royal scepter! This is a lamentation and serves as a lamentation."}

", "4": "If they hear the trumpet but do not take the warning and a sword attacks and kills them, their blood will be on their own heads. ", "5": "They heard the trumpet blast but ignored the warning; their blood is on them. If they had heeded the warning, they could have escaped with their lives. ", "6": "If, however, the sentinel sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the sword attacks and takes someone's life, his life will be taken for his own sin, but I will hold the sentinel responsible for his blood.", "7": "You, son of man\u2014I have appointed you as a sentinel for the house of Israel; when you hear a word from my mouth, you must warn them for me.

No, the just cannot save their lives on the day they sin.

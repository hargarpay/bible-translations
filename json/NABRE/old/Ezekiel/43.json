", "3": "The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like the vision I had seen by the river Chebar\u2014I fell on my face. ", "4": "The glory of the Lord entered the temple by way of the gate facing east. ", "5": "Then the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court. And there the glory of the Lord filled the temple! ", "6": "I heard someone speaking to me from the temple, but the man was standing beside me. ", "7": "The voice said to me: Son of man, do you see the place for my throne, and the place for the soles of my feet? Here I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel, neither they nor their kings, will never again defile my holy name, with their prostitutions and the corpses of their kings at their death. ", "8": "When they placed their threshold against my threshold[a] and their doorpost next to mine, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by the abominations they committed, and I devoured them in my wrath. ", "9": "From now on, let them put their prostitution and the corpses of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.", "10": "The Law of the Temple. 10\u00a0As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel so they are ashamed for their sins. Let them measure its layout. ", "11": "If they are ashamed for all they have done, tell them about the layout and design of the temple, its exits and entrances, with all its regulations and instructions; write it down for them to see, that they may carefully observe all its laws and statutes.

This is the law for the temple.", "13": "The Altar. 13\u00a0These were the dimensions of the altar[b] in cubits, a cubit being one cubit plus a handbreadth. The channel was one cubit deep by one cubit wide, and its rim had a lip one span wide all around it. The height of the altar itself was as follows: ", "14": "from the channel at floor level up to the lower ledge was two cubits, with the ledge one cubit wide; from the lower ledge to the upper ledge, four cubits, with the ledge one cubit wide.

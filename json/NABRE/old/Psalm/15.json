{"1": "A psalm of David. Lord, who may abide in your tent?[b] Who may dwell on your holy mountain?", "2": "Whoever walks without blame, doing what is right, speaking truth from the heart;", "3": "Who does not slander with his tongue, does no harm to a friend, never defames a neighbor;", "4": "Who disdains the wicked, but honors those who fear the Lord; Who keeps an oath despite the cost,", "5": "lends no money at interest,[c] accepts no bribe against the innocent. Whoever acts like this shall never be shaken."}

{"1": "A psalm. A song for the dedication of the Temple.[b] Of David.", "2": "I praise you, Lord, for you raised me up and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.", "3": "O Lord, my God, I cried out to you for help and you healed[c] me.", "4": "Lord, you brought my soul up from Sheol; you let me live, from going down to the pit.[d]", "5": "Sing praise to the Lord, you faithful; give thanks to his holy memory.", "6": "For his anger lasts but a moment; his favor a lifetime. At dusk weeping comes for the night; but at dawn there is rejoicing.", "7": "Complacent,[e] I once said, \u201cI shall never be shaken.\u201d", "8": "Lord, you showed me favor, established for me mountains of virtue. But when you hid your face I was struck with terror.", "9": "To you, Lord, I cried out; with the Lord I pleaded for mercy:", "10": "[f]\u201cWhat gain is there from my lifeblood, from my going down to the grave? Does dust give you thanks or declare your faithfulness?", "11": "Hear, O Lord, have mercy on me; Lord, be my helper.\u201d", "12": "You changed my mourning into dancing; you took off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness.", "13": "So that my glory may praise you and not be silent. O Lord, my God, forever will I give you thanks."}

{"1": "A psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd;[b] there is nothing I lack.", "2": "In green pastures he makes me lie down; to still waters he leads me;", "3": "he restores my soul. He guides me along right paths[c] for the sake of his name.", "4": "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff comfort me.", "5": "[d]You set a table before me in front of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.", "6": "Indeed, goodness and mercy[e] will pursue me all the days of my life; I will dwell in the house of the Lord for endless days."}

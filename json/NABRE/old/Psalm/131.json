{"1": "A song of ascents. Of David. Lord, my heart is not proud; nor are my eyes haughty. I do not busy myself with great matters, with things too sublime for me.", "2": "Rather, I have stilled my soul, Like a weaned child to its mother, weaned is my soul.", "3": "Israel, hope in the Lord, now and forever."}

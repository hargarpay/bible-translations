{"1": "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the way[b] of sinners, nor sit in company with scoffers.", "2": "Rather, the law of the Lord[c] is his joy; and on his law he meditates day and night.", "3": "He is like a tree planted near streams of water, that yields its fruit in season; Its leaves never wither; whatever he does prospers.", "4": "But not so are the wicked,[d] not so! They are like chaff driven by the wind.", "5": "Therefore the wicked will not arise at the judgment, nor will sinners in the assembly of the just.", "6": "Because the Lord knows the way of the just, but the way of the wicked leads to ruin."}

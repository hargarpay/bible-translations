{"1": "A psalm of David. The Lord says to my lord:[b] \u201cSit at my right hand, while I make your enemies your footstool.\u201d", "2": "The scepter of your might: the Lord extends your strong scepter from Zion. Have dominion over your enemies!", "3": "Yours is princely power from the day of your birth. In holy splendor before the daystar, like dew I begot you.", "4": "The Lord has sworn and will not waver: \u201cYou are a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.\u201d[c]", "5": "At your right hand is the Lord, who crushes kings on the day of his wrath,", "6": "Who judges nations, heaps up corpses, crushes heads across the wide earth,", "7": "[d]Who drinks from the brook by the wayside and thus holds high his head."}

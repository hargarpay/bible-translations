{"1": "A psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.", "2": "They have left the corpses of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of those devoted to you for the beasts of the earth.", "3": "They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and no one is left to do the burying.", "4": "We have become the reproach of our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.", "5": "How long, Lord? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealous anger keep burning like fire?", "6": "Pour out your wrath on nations that do not recognize you, on kingdoms that do not call on your name,", "7": "For they have devoured Jacob, laid waste his dwelling place.", "8": "Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let your compassion move quickly ahead of us, for we have been brought very low.", "9": "Help us, God our savior, on account of the glory of your name. Deliver us, pardon our sins for your name's sake.", "10": "Why should the nations say, \u201cWhere is their God?\u201d Before our eyes make known to the nations that you avenge the blood of your servants which has been poured out.", "11": "Let the groaning of the imprisoned come in before you; in accord with the greatness of your arm preserve those doomed to die.", "12": "Turn back sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors the insult with which they insulted you, Lord.", "13": "Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise."}

Lord, I call to you; hasten to me; listen to my plea when I call.", "2": "Let my prayer be incense[b] before you; my uplifted hands an evening offering.", "3": "Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, keep watch over the door of my lips.", "4": "Do not let my heart incline to evil, to perform deeds in wickedness. On the delicacies of evildoers let me not feast.", "5": "[c]Let a righteous person strike me; it is mercy if he reproves me. Do not withhold oil from my head while my prayer opposes their evil deeds.", "6": "May their leaders be cast over the cliff, so that they hear that my speeches are pleasing.", "7": "Like the plowing and breaking up of the earth, our bones are strewn at the mouth of Sheol.", "8": "For my eyes are upon you, O Lord, my Lord; in you I take refuge; do not take away my soul.", "9": "Guard me from the trap they have set for me, from the snares of evildoers.", "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while only I pass over them safely."}

{"1": "Oracle[a] concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.", "2": "[b]A jealous and avenging God[c] is the Lord, an avenger is the Lord, full of wrath; The Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries, and rages against his enemies;", "3": "The Lord is slow to anger, yet great in power; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. In stormwind[d] and tempest he comes, and clouds are the dust at his feet;", "4": "He roars at the sea and leaves it dry, and all the rivers he dries up. Laid low are Bashan and Carmel, and the bloom of Lebanon withers;[e]", "5": "The mountains quake before him, and the hills dissolve; The earth is laid waste before him, the world and all who dwell in it.", "6": "[f]Before his wrath, who can stand firm, and who can face his blazing anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and boulders break apart before him.", "7": "The Lord is good to those who wait for him, a refuge on the day of distress, Taking care of those who look to him for protection,", "8": "when the flood rages; He makes an end of his opponents, and pursues his enemies into darkness.", "9": "What do you plot against the Lord, the one about to bring total destruction? No opponent rises a second time!", "10": "[g]Like a thorny thicket, they are tangled, and like drunkards, they are drunk; like dry stubble, they are utterly consumed.", "11": "From you has come one plotting evil against the Lord, one giving sinister counsel.[h]", "12": "Thus says the Lord: though fully intact and so numerous, they[i] shall be mown down and disappear. Though I have humbled you, I will humble you no more.", "13": "Now I will break his yoke off of you, and tear off your bonds.", "14": "The Lord has commanded regarding you:[j] no descendant will again bear your name; From the house of your gods I will abolish the carved and the molten image; I will make your grave a dung heap."}

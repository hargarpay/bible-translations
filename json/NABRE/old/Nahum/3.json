The bloody city, all lies, Full of plunder, whose looting never stops!", "2": "The crack of the whip, the rumbling of wheels; Horses galloping, chariots bounding,", "3": "Cavalry charging, the flash of the sword, the gleam of the spear; A multitude of slain, a mass of corpses, Endless bodies to stumble upon!", "4": "For the many debaucheries of the prostitute, a charming mistress of witchcraft, Who enslaved nations with her prostitution, and peoples by her witchcraft:", "5": "[a]I now come against you\u2014 oracle of the Lord of hosts\u2014 and I will lift your skirt above your face; I will show your nakedness to the nations, to the kingdoms your shame!", "6": "I will cast filth upon you, disgrace you and make you a spectacle;", "7": "Until everyone who sees you runs from you saying, \u201cNineveh is destroyed; who can pity her? Where can I find any to console you?\u201d", "8": "Are you better than No-amon[b] that was set among the Nile's canals, Surrounded by waters, with the river for her rampart and water for her wall?", "9": "Ethiopia was her strength, and Egypt without end; Put[c] and the Libyans were her allies.", "10": "Yet even she became an exile, and went into captivity; Even her little ones were dashed to pieces at the corner of every street; For her nobles they cast lots, and all her great ones were put into chains.", "11": "You, too, will drink of this; you will be overcome; You, too, will seek a refuge from the foe.", "12": "But all your fortresses are fig trees, bearing early figs;[d] When shaken, they fall into the devourer's mouth.", "13": "Indeed your troops are women in your midst; To your foes are open wide the gates of your land, fire has consumed their bars.", "14": "Draw water for the siege,[e] strengthen your fortresses; Go down into the mud and tread the clay, take hold of the brick mold!", "15": "There the fire will consume you, the sword will cut you down; it will consume you like the grasshoppers. Multiply like the grasshoppers, multiply like the locusts!", "16": "You have made your traders[f] more numerous than the stars of the heavens; like grasshoppers that shed their skins and fly away.", "17": "Your sentries are like locusts, and your scribes like locust swarms Gathered on the rubble fences on a cold day! Yet when the sun rises, they vanish, and no one knows where they have gone.", "18": "Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria, your nobles have gone to rest; Your people are scattered upon the mountains, with none to gather them.", "19": "There is no healing for your hurt, your wound is fatal. All who hear this news of you clap their hands over you; For who has not suffered under your endless malice?"}

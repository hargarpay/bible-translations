{"1": "At this moment on the mountains the footsteps of one bearing good news, of one announcing peace! Celebrate your feasts, Judah, fulfill your vows! For never again will destroyers invade you;[a] they are completely cut off.", "2": "One who scatters has come up against you;[b] guard the rampart, Watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!", "3": "[c]The Lord will restore the vine of Jacob, the honor of Israel, Because ravagers have ravaged them and ruined their branches.", "4": "The shields of his warriors are crimsoned, the soldiers clad in scarlet; Like fire are the trappings of the chariots on the day he prepares for war; the cavalry is agitated!", "5": "The chariots dash madly through the streets and wheel in the squares, Looking like torches, bolting like lightning.", "6": "His picked troops are called, ranks break at their charge; To the wall they rush, their screen[d] is set up.", "7": "The river gates[e] are opened, the palace is washed away.", "8": "The mistress is led forth captive, and her maidservants[f] led away, Moaning like doves, beating their breasts.", "9": "Nineveh is like a pool whose waters escape; \u201cStop! Stop!\u201d but none turns back.", "10": "\u201cPlunder the silver, plunder the gold!\u201d There is no end to the treasure, to wealth in every precious thing!", "11": "Emptiness, desolation, waste; melting hearts and trembling knees, Churning in every stomach, every face turning pale!", "12": "Where is the lionesses' den, the young lions' cave, Where the lion[g] went in and out, and the cub, with no one to disturb them?", "13": "The lion tore apart enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses; He filled his lairs with prey, and his dens with torn flesh.", "14": "I now come against you\u2014 oracle of the Lord of hosts\u2014 I will consume your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions; Your preying on the land I will bring to an end, the cry of your lionesses will be heard no more."}

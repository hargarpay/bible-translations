{"1": "[a]When Israel was a child I loved him, out of Egypt[b] I called my son.", "2": "The more I called them, the farther they went from me, Sacrificing to the Baals and burning incense to idols.", "3": "Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, who took them in my arms; but they did not know that I cared for them.", "4": "I drew them with human cords, with bands of love;[c] I fostered them like those who raise an infant to their cheeks; I bent down to feed them.", "5": "He shall return to the land of Egypt, Assyria shall be his king, because they have refused to repent.", "6": "The sword shall rage in his cities: it shall destroy his diviners, and devour them because of their schemings.", "7": "My people have their mind set on apostasy; though they call on God in unison, he shall not raise them up.", "8": "How could I give you up, Ephraim, or deliver you up, Israel? How could I treat you as Admah, or make you like Zeboiim?[d] My heart is overwhelmed, my pity is stirred.", "9": "I will not give vent to my blazing anger, I will not destroy Ephraim again; For I am God and not a man, the Holy One present among you; I will not come in wrath.", "10": "They shall follow the Lord, who roars like a lion; When he roars, his children shall come frightened from the west,", "11": "Out of Egypt they shall come trembling, like birds, like doves, from the land of Assyria; And I will resettle them in their homes, oracle of the Lord."}

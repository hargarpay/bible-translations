{"1": "When I would have restored the fortunes of my people, when I would have healed Israel, The guilt of Ephraim was revealed, the wickedness of Samaria: They practiced falsehood. Thieves break in, bandits roam outside.", "2": "Yet they do not call to mind that I remember all their wickedness. Now their crimes surround them, present to my sight.", "3": "With their wickedness they make the king rejoice, the princes too, with their treacherous deeds.", "4": "They are all adulterers,[b] like a blazing oven, Which the baker quits stoking, after the dough's kneading until its rising.", "5": "On the day of our king, they made the princes sick with poisoned wine; he extended his hand to the scoffers.", "6": "For they draw near in ambush with their hearts like an oven. All the night their anger sleeps; in the morning it flares like a blazing fire.", "7": "They are all heated like ovens, and consume their rulers. All their kings have fallen; none of them calls upon me.", "8": "Ephraim is mixed with the nations,[c] Ephraim is an unturned cake.", "9": "Strangers have consumed his strength, but he does not know it; Gray hairs are strewn on his head, but he takes no notice of it.", "10": "The arrogance of Israel bears witness against him; yet they do not return to the Lord, their God, nor seek him, despite all this.", "11": "Ephraim is like a dove, silly and senseless; They call upon Egypt, they go to Assyria.", "12": "When they go I will spread my net around them, like birds in the air I will bring them down. I will chastise them when I hear of their assembly.", "13": "Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Ruin to them, for they have rebelled against me! Though I wished to redeem them, they spoke lies against me.", "14": "They have not cried to me from their hearts when they wailed upon their beds; For wheat and wine they lacerated themselves;[d] they rebelled against me.", "15": "Though I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they devised evil against me.", "16": "They have again become useless, they have been like a treacherous bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongues; thus they shall be mocked in the land of Egypt."}

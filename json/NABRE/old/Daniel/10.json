The revelation was certain: a great war;[b] he understood this from the vision. ", "2": "In those days, I, Daniel, mourned three full weeks. ", "3": "I ate no savory food, took no meat or wine, and did not anoint myself at all until the end of the three weeks.", "4": "On the twenty-fourth day of the first month[c] I was on the bank of the great river, the Tigris. ", "5": "As I looked up, I saw a man[d] dressed in linen with a belt of fine gold around his waist. ", "6": "His body was like chrysolite, his face shone like lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and feet looked like burnished bronze, and the sound of his voice was like the roar of a multitude. ", "7": "I alone, Daniel, saw the vision; but great fear seized those who were with me; they fled and hid themselves, although they did not see the vision. ", "8": "So I was left alone to see this great vision. No strength remained in me; I turned the color of death and was powerless.

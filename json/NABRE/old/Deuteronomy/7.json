Make no covenant with them and do not be gracious to them. ", "3": "You shall not intermarry with them, neither giving your daughters to their sons nor taking their daughters for your sons. ", "4": "For they would turn your sons from following me to serving other gods, and then the anger of the Lord would flare up against you and he would quickly destroy you.", "5": "But this is how you must deal with them: Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, chop down their asherahs,[a] and destroy their idols by fire. ", "6": "For you are a people holy to the Lord, your God; the Lord, your God, has chosen you from all the peoples on the face of the earth to be a people specially his own. ", "7": "It was not because you are more numerous than all the peoples that the Lord set his heart on you and chose you; for you are really the smallest of all peoples.

{"1": "Plots Against Nehemiah. 1\u00a0When it had been reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and our other enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and that there was no breach left in it (though up to that time I had not yet set up the doors in the gates), ", "2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: \u201cCome, let us hold council together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.\u201d They were planning to do me harm. ", "3": "I sent messengers to them with this reply: \u201cI am engaged in a great enterprise and am unable to come down. Why should the work stop, while I leave it to come down to you?\u201d ", "4": "Four times they sent me this same proposal, and each time I gave the same reply. ", "5": "Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent me the same message by one of his servants, who bore an unsealed letter ", "6": "containing this text: \u201cAmong the nations it has been reported\u2014Gashmu[a] is witness to this\u2014that you and the Jews are planning a rebellion; that for this reason you are rebuilding the wall; and that you are to be their king. ", "7": "Also, that you have set up prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim you king of Judah. Now, since matters like these will reach the ear of the king, come, let us hold council together.\u201d ", "8": "I sent him this answer: \u201cNothing of what you report is happening; rather, it is the invention of your own mind.\u201d ", "9": "They were all trying to intimidate us, thinking, \u201cThey will be discouraged from continuing with the work, and it will never be completed.\u201d But instead, I then redoubled my efforts.", "10": "I went to the house of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house, and he said: \u201cLet us meet in the house of God, inside the temple building; let us lock the doors of the temple. For they are coming to kill you\u2014by night they are coming to kill you.\u201d ", "11": "My answer was: \u201cA man like me take flight? Should a man like me enter the temple to save his life? I will not go!\u201d ", "12": "For on consideration, it was plain to me that God had not sent him; rather, because Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him, he voiced this prophecy concerning me, ", "13": "that I might act on it out of fear and commit this sin.

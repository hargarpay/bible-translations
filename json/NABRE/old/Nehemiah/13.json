", "6": "During all this time I had not been in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,[c] king of Babylon, I had gone back to the king. After a suitable period of time, however, I asked leave of the king ", "7": "and returned to Jerusalem, where I discovered the evil thing that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in setting aside for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. ", "8": "This displeased me very much, so I had all of Tobiah's household goods thrown outside the chamber. ", "9": "Then I gave orders to purify the chambers, and I brought back the vessels of the house of God, the grain offerings, and the incense.", "10": "I learned, too, that the portions due the Levites were no longer being given, so that the Levites and the singers who should have been carrying out the services had deserted to their own fields. ", "11": "I reprimanded the magistrates, demanding, \u201cWhy is the house of God neglected?\u201d Then I brought the Levites together and had them resume their stations.

", "13": "In charge of the storerooms I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah, one of the Levites, together with Hanan, son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, as their assistant; for they were considered trustworthy. It was their duty to make the distribution to their kinsmen. ", "14": "Remember this to my credit, my God! Do not forget the good deeds I have done for the house of my God and its services!", "15": "Sabbath Observance. 15\u00a0In those days I perceived that people in Judah were treading the wine presses on the sabbath; that they were bringing in sheaves of grain, loading them on their donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs, and every other kind of load, and bringing them to Jerusalem on the sabbath day. I warned them to sell none of these provisions.

Would you add to the wrath against Israel by once more profaning the sabbath?\u201d", "19": "When the shadows were falling on the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I ordered the doors to be closed and prohibited their reopening until after the sabbath.

If you keep this up, I will beat you!\u201d From that time on, they did not return on the sabbath.

I drove him from my presence. ", "29": "Remember against them, my God, how they defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites!", "30": "So I cleansed them of all foreign contamination. I established the various functions for the priests and Levites, so that each had an appointed task. ", "31": "I also provided for the procurement of wood at stated times and for the first fruits.

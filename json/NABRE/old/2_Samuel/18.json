{"1": "Preparation for Battle. 1\u00a0After mustering the troops he had with him, David placed officers in command of units of a thousand and units of a hundred. ", "2": "David then divided the troops three ways, a third under Joab, a third under Abishai, son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, \u201cI intend to go out with you myself.\u201d ", "3": "But they replied: \u201cYou must not come out with us. For if we flee, no one will care; even if half of us die, no one will care. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that we have you to help us from the city.\u201d ", "4": "The king said to them, \u201cI will do what you think best.\u201d So the king stood by the gate as all the soldiers marched out in units of a hundred and a thousand. ", "5": "But the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: \u201cBe gentle with young Absalom for my sake.\u201d All the soldiers heard as the king gave commands to the various leaders with regard to Absalom.", "6": "Defeat of Absalom's Forces. 6\u00a0David's army then took the field against Israel, and a battle was fought in the forest near Mahanaim. ", "7": "The forces of Israel were defeated by David's servants, and the casualties there that day were heavy\u2014twenty thousand men. ", "8": "The battle spread out over that entire region, and the forest consumed more combatants that day than did the sword.", "9": "Death of Absalom. 9\u00a0Absalom unexpectedly came up against David's servants. He was mounted on a mule, and, as the mule passed under the branches of a large oak tree, his hair caught fast in the tree. He hung between heaven and earth while the mule under him kept going. ", "10": "Someone saw this and reported to Joab, \u201cI saw Absalom hanging from an oak tree.\u201d ", "11": "Joab said to the man who told him this: \u201cIf you saw him, why did you not strike him to the ground on the spot? Then it would have been my duty to give you fifty pieces of silver and a belt.\u201d ", "12": "But the man replied to Joab: \u201cEven if I already held a thousand pieces of silver in my two hands, I would not lay a hand on the king's son, for in our hearing the king gave you and Abishai and Ittai a command: 'Protect the youth Absalom for my sake.' ", "13": "Had I been disloyal and killed him, it would all have come out before the king, and you would stand aloof.\u201d ", "14": "Joab replied, \u201cI will not waste time with you in this way.\u201d And taking three pikes in hand, he thrust for the heart of Absalom. He was still alive in the tree. ", "15": "When ten of Joab's young armor-bearers closed in on Absalom, and killed him with further blows, ", "16": "Joab then sounded the horn, and the soldiers turned back from the pursuit of the Israelites, because Joab called them to halt. ", "17": "They took Absalom and cast him into a deep pit in the forest, and built up a very large mound of stones over him. And all the Israelites fled to their own tents.", "18": "During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and set it up for himself in the King's Valley, for he said, \u201cI have no son to perpetuate my name.\u201d The pillar which he named for himself is called Absalom's Monument to the present day.", "19": "David Told of Absalom's Death. 19\u00a0Then Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, said, \u201cLet me run to take the good news to the king that the Lord has set him free from the power of his enemies.\u201d ", "20": "But Joab said to him: \u201cYou are not the man to bring the news today. On some other day you may take the good news, but today you would not be bringing good news, for in fact the king's son is dead.\u201d ", "21": "Then Joab said to a Cushite, \u201cGo, tell the king what you have seen.\u201d The Cushite bowed to Joab and ran off. ", "22": "But Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, said to Joab again, \u201cCome what may, permit me also to run after the Cushite.\u201d Joab replied: \u201cWhy do you want to run, my son? You will receive no reward.\u201d ", "23": "But he insisted, \u201cCome what may, I want to run.\u201d Joab said to him, \u201cRun.\u201d Ahimaaz took the way of the Jordan plain and outran the Cushite.", "24": "Now David was sitting between the two gates, and a lookout mounted to the roof of the gate above the city wall, where he looked out and saw a man running all alone. ", "25": "The lookout shouted to inform the king, who said, \u201cIf he is alone, he has good news to report.\u201d As he kept coming nearer, ", "26": "the lookout spied another runner. From his place atop the gate he cried out, \u201cThere is another man running by himself.\u201d And the king responded, \u201cHe, too, is bringing good news.\u201d ", "27": "Then the lookout said, \u201cI notice that the first one runs like Ahimaaz, son of Zadok.\u201d The king replied, \u201cHe is a good man; he comes with good news.\u201d ", "28": "Then Ahimaaz called out and greeted the king. With face to the ground he paid homage to the king and said, \u201cBlessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who rebelled against my lord the king.\u201d ", "29": "But the king asked, \u201cIs young Absalom safe?\u201d And Ahimaaz replied, \u201cI saw a great disturbance when the king's servant Joab sent your servant on, but I do not know what it was.\u201d ", "30": "The king said, \u201cStep aside and remain in attendance here.\u201d So he stepped aside and remained there. ", "31": "When the Cushite came in, he said, \u201cLet my lord the king receive the good news that this day the Lord has freed you from the power of all who rose up against you.\u201d ", "32": "But the king asked the Cushite, \u201cIs young Absalom all right?\u201d The Cushite replied, \u201cMay the enemies of my lord the king and all who rebel against you with evil intent be as that young man!\u201d"}

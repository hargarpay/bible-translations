{"1": "David and Ziba. 1\u00a0David went a little beyond the top and Ziba, the servant of Meribbaal, was there to meet him with saddled donkeys laden with two hundred loaves of bread, an ephah of cakes of pressed raisins, an ephah of summer fruits, and a skin of wine. ", "2": "The king said to Ziba, \u201cWhat are you doing with all this?\u201d Ziba replied: \u201cThe donkeys are for the king's household to ride on. The bread and summer fruits are for your servants to eat, and the wine to drink when they grow weary in the wilderness.\u201d ", "3": "Then the king said, \u201cAnd where is your lord's son?\u201d Ziba answered the king, \u201cHe is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore to me my father's kingdom.'\u201d ", "4": "The king therefore said to Ziba, \u201cSo! Everything Meribbaal had is yours.\u201d Then Ziba said: \u201cI pay you homage, my lord the king. May I find favor with you!\u201d", "5": "David and Shimei. 5\u00a0As King David was approaching Bahurim, there was a man coming out; he was of the same clan as the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei, son of Gera.

", "7": "Shimei was saying as he cursed: \u201cGet out! Get out! You man of blood, you scoundrel! ", "8": "The Lord has paid you back for all the blood shed from the family of Saul,[a] whom you replaced as king, and the Lord has handed over the kingdom to your son Absalom. And now look at you: you suffer ruin because you are a man of blood.\u201d ", "9": "Abishai, son of Zeruiah, said to the king: \u201cWhy should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.\u201d ", "10": "But the king replied: \u201cWhat business is it of mine or of yours, sons of Zeruiah, that he curses? Suppose the Lord has told him to curse David; who then will dare to say, 'Why are you doing this?'\u201d ", "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants: \u201cIf my own son, who came forth from my loins, is seeking my life, how much more might this Benjaminite do so!

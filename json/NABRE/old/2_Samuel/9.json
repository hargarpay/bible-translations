{"1": "David and Meribbaal. 1\u00a0David asked, \u201cIs there any survivor of Saul's house to whom I may show kindness for the sake of Jonathan?\u201d ", "2": "Now there was an official of the house of Saul named Ziba. He was summoned to David, and the king asked him, \u201cAre you Ziba?\u201d He replied, \u201cYour servant.\u201d ", "3": "Then the king asked, \u201cIs there any survivor of Saul's house to whom I may show God's kindness?\u201d Ziba answered the king, \u201cThere is still Jonathan's son, the one whose feet are crippled.\u201d ", "4": "The king asked him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d and Ziba answered the king, \u201cHe is in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.\u201d ", "5": "So King David sent for him and had him brought from the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, from Lodebar. ", "6": "When Meribbaal, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David, he fell face down in homage. David said, \u201cMeribbaal,\u201d and he answered, \u201cYour servant.\u201d ", "7": "\u201cDo not be afraid,\u201d David said to him, \u201cI will surely be kind to you for the sake of Jonathan your father. I will restore to you all the lands of Saul your grandfather, and you shall eat at my table always.\u201d ", "8": "Bowing low, he answered, \u201cWhat am I, your servant, that you should pay attention to a dead dog like me?\u201d ", "9": "The king then called Ziba, Saul's attendant, and said to him: \u201cAll that belonged to Saul and to his entire house, I am giving to your lord's son. ", "10": "You and your sons and servants must till the land for him. You shall bring in the produce, which shall be food for your lord's household to eat. But Meribbaal, your lord's son, shall always eat at my table.\u201d Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. ", "11": "Ziba answered the king, \u201cWhatever my lord the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do.\u201d And so Meribbaal ate at David's table like one of the king's sons.

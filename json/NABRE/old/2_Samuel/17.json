", "3": "Then I can bring back the rest of the people to you, as a bride returns to her husband. It is the death of only one man you are seeking; then all the people will be at peace.\u201d ", "4": "This plan sounded good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.", "5": "Counsel of Hushai. 5\u00a0Then Absalom said, \u201cNow call Hushai the Archite also; let us hear what he too has to say.\u201d ", "6": "When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him: \u201cThis is Ahithophel's plan. Shall we follow his plan? If not, give your own.\u201d ", "7": "Hushai replied to Absalom, \u201cThis time Ahithophel has not given good counsel.\u201d ", "8": "And he went on to say: \u201cYou know that your father and his men are warriors, and that they are as fierce as a bear in the wild robbed of her cubs. Moreover, since your father is a skilled fighter, he will not spend the night with the army. ", "9": "Even now he lies hidden in one of the caves or in one of his other places. And if some of our soldiers should fall at the first attack, whoever hears of it will say, 'Absalom's followers have been slaughtered.'

A maidservant was to come with information for them, and they in turn were to go and report to King David. They could not risk being seen entering the city, ", "18": "but an attendant did see them and informed Absalom.

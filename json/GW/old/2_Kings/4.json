{"1": "One of the wives of a disciple of the prophets called to Elisha, \u201cSir, my husband is dead! You know how he feared the Lord. Now a creditor has come to take my two children as slaves.\u201d", "2": "Elisha asked her, \u201cWhat should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?\u201d She answered, \u201cI have nothing in the house except a jar of olive oil.\u201d", "3": "Elisha said, \u201cBorrow many empty containers from all your neighbors. ", "4": "Then close the door behind you and your children, and pour oil into all those containers. When one is full, set it aside.\u201d", "5": "So she left him and closed the door behind her and her children. The children kept bringing containers to her, and she kept pouring. ", "6": "When the containers were full, she told her son, \u201cBring me another container.\u201d He told her, \u201cThere are no more containers.\u201d So the olive oil stopped flowing. ", "7": "She went and told the man of God. He said, \u201cSell the oil, and pay your debt. The rest is for you and your children.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha was traveling through Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She had invited him to eat with her. So whenever he was in the area, he stopped in to eat.", "9": "She told her husband, \u201cI know he's a holy man of God. And he regularly travels past our house. ", "10": "Let's make a small room on the roof and put a bed, table, chair, and lamp stand there for him. He can stay there whenever he comes to visit us.\u201d", "11": "One day he came to their house, went into the upstairs room, and rested there. ", "12": "He told his servant Gehazi, \u201cCall this Shunem woman.\u201d Gehazi called her, and she stood in front of him. ", "13": "Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cAsk her what we can do for her, since she has gone to a lot of trouble for us. Maybe she would like us to speak to the king or the commander of the army for her.\u201d She answered, \u201cI'm already living among my own people.\u201d", "14": "\u201cWhat should we do for her?\u201d Elisha asked. Gehazi answered, \u201cWell, she has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "Elisha said, \u201cCall her.\u201d So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. ", "16": "Elisha said, \u201cAt this time next spring, you will hold a baby boy in your arms.\u201d She answered, \u201cDon't say that, sir. Don't lie to me. You're a man of God.\u201d", "17": "But the woman became pregnant and had a son at that time next year, as Elisha had told her.", "18": "Several years later the boy went to his father, who was with the harvest workers. ", "19": "Suddenly, he said to his father, \u201cMy head! My head!\u201d The father told his servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d", "20": "The servant picked him up and brought him to his mother. The boy sat on her lap until noon, when he died. ", "21": "She took him upstairs and laid him on the bed of the man of God, left the room, and shut the door behind her. ", "22": "She called her husband and said, \u201cPlease send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys. I will go quickly to the man of God and come back again.\u201d", "23": "Her husband asked, \u201cWhy are you going to him today? It isn't a New Moon Festival or a day of rest\u2014a holy day.\u201d But she said goodbye to him.", "24": "She saddled the donkey. Then she told her servant, \u201cLead on. Don't slow down unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "So she came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her coming at a distance, he told his servant Gehazi, \u201cThere is the woman from Shunem. ", "26": "Run to meet her and ask her how she, her husband, and the boy are doing.\u201d \u201cEveryone's fine,\u201d she answered.", "27": "When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi went to push her away. But the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone. She is bitter. The Lord has hidden the reason from me. He hasn't told me.\u201d", "28": "The woman said, \u201cI didn't ask you for a son. I said, 'Don't raise my hopes.'\u201d", "29": "The man of God told Gehazi, \u201cPut on a belt, take my shepherd's staff in your hand, and go. Whenever you meet anyone, don't stop to greet him. If he greets you, don't stop to answer him. Lay my staff on the boy's face.\u201d", "30": "The boy's mother said, \u201cI solemnly swear, as the Lord and you live, I will not leave without you.\u201d So Elisha got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi went ahead of them and put the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or sign of life. So Gehazi came back to meet the man of God. Gehazi told him, \u201cThe boy didn't wake up.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha came to the house, the dead boy was lying on Elisha's bed. ", "33": "He went into the room, closed the door, and prayed to the Lord. ", "34": "Then he lay on the boy, putting his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on the boy's eyes, his hands on the boy's hands. He crouched over the boy's body, and it became warm. ", "35": "Elisha got up, walked across the room and came back, and then got back on the bed and crouched over him. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. ", "36": "Elisha called Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunem woman.\u201d Gehazi called her. When she came to him, he said, \u201cTake your son.\u201d", "37": "Then she immediately bowed at his feet. She took her son and left.", "38": "When Elisha went back to Gilgal, there was a famine in the country. One day, while the disciples of the prophets were meeting with him, he told his servant, \u201cPut a large pot on the fire, and cook some stew for the disciples of the prophets.\u201d", "39": "One of them went into the field to gather vegetables and found a wild vine. He filled his clothes with wild gourds. Then he cut them into the pot of stew without knowing what they were. ", "40": "They dished out the food for the men to eat. As they were eating the stew, they cried out, \u201cThere's death in the pot, man of God!\u201d So they couldn't eat it.", "41": "Elisha said, \u201cBring some flour.\u201d He threw it into the pot and said, \u201cDish it out for the people to eat.\u201d Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.", "42": "A man from Baal Shalisha brought bread made from the first harvested grain, 20 barley loaves, and fresh grain to the man of God. The man of God said, \u201cGive it to the people to eat.\u201d", "43": "But his servant asked, \u201cHow can I set this in front of a hundred people?\u201d \u201cGive it to the people to eat,\u201d the man of God said. \u201cThis is what the Lord says: They will eat and even have some left over.\u201d", "44": "The servant set it in front of them. They ate and had some left over, as the Lord had predicted."}

They said, 'Give us the man who killed his brother so that we can kill him because he took his brother's life. We're going to destroy the one who now would be the heir.'

It would be better for me if I were still there. Let me see the king now! If I'm guilty of a sin, he should kill me.\u201d", "33": "Joab went to the king and told him this. The king then called for Absalom, who came to the king and bowed down with his face touching the ground. And the king kissed Absalom."}

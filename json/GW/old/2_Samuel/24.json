That way I will know how many there are.\u201d", "3": "Joab responded to the king, \u201cMay the Lord your God multiply the people a hundred times over, and may Your Majesty live to see it. But why does Your Majesty wish to do this?\u201d", "4": "However, the king overruled Joab and the commanders of the army. So they left the king in order to count the people of Israel.

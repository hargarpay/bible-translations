{"1": "David called together the troops that were with him. He appointed commanders in charge of regiments and battalions. ", "2": "David put a third of the troops under Joab's command, another third under Joab's brother Abishai (Zeruiah's son), and the last third under Ittai from Gath. \u201cI am going into battle with you,\u201d the king said to the troops.", "3": "\u201cYou're not going with us,\u201d the troops said. \u201cIf we flee, they won't care about us, and if half of us die, they won't care either. But you're worth 10,000 of us. It's better for you to be ready to send us help from the city.\u201d", "4": "\u201cI'll do what you think best,\u201d the king responded. So the king stood by the gate while all the troops marched out by battalions and regiments.", "5": "The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, \u201cTreat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.\u201d All the troops heard him give all the commanders this order regarding Absalom.", "6": "So the troops went out to the country to fight Israel in the forest of Ephraim. ", "7": "There David's men defeated Israel's army, and the massacre was sizable that day\u201420,000 men. ", "8": "The fighting spread over the whole country. That day the woods devoured more people than the battle.", "9": "Absalom happened to come face to face with some of David's men. He was riding on a mule, and the mule went under the tangled branches of a large tree. Absalom's head became caught in the tree. So he was left hanging[a] in midair when the mule that was under him ran away. ", "10": "A man who saw this told Joab, \u201cI saw Absalom hanging in a tree.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWhat! You saw that!\u201d Joab said to the man who told him. \u201cWhy didn't you strike him to the ground? Then I would have felt obligated to give you four ounces of silver and a belt.\u201d", "12": "But the man told Joab, \u201cEven if I felt the weight of 25 pounds of silver in my hand, I wouldn't raise my hand against the king's son. We heard the order the king gave you, Abishai, and Ittai: 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.'", "13": "[b] 13\u00a0If I had done something treacherous to him, would you have stood by me? Like everything else, it wouldn't stay hidden from the king.\u201d", "14": "Then Joab said, \u201cI shouldn't waste time with you like this.\u201d He took three sharp sticks and plunged them into Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the tree. ", "15": "Then ten of Joab's armorbearers surrounded Absalom, attacked him, and killed him.", "16": "Joab blew the ram's horn to stop their fighting, and the troops returned from pursuing Israel. ", "17": "They took Absalom, threw him into a huge pit in the forest, and piled a large heap of stones over him. Meanwhile, all Israel fled and went back to their homes.", "18": "(While he was still living, Absalom had taken a rock and set it up for himself in the king's valley. He said, \u201cI have no son to keep the memory of my name alive.\u201d He called the rock by his name, and it is still called Absalom's Monument today.)", "19": "Then Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, said, \u201cLet me run and bring the king the good news that the Lord has freed him from his enemies.\u201d", "20": "But Joab told him, \u201cYou won't be the man carrying good news today. You can carry the news some other day. You must not deliver the news today because the king's son is dead.\u201d ", "21": "Then Joab said to a man from Sudan, \u201cGo, tell the king what you saw.\u201d The messenger bowed down with his face touching the ground in front of Joab and then ran off.", "22": "Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, spoke to Joab again, \u201cWhatever may happen, I also want to run after the Sudanese messenger.\u201d \u201cNow, son, why should you deliver the message?\u201d Joab asked. \u201cYou won't be rewarded for this news.\u201d", "23": "\u201cWhatever happens, I'd like to run,\u201d replied Ahimaaz. \u201cRun,\u201d Joab told him. So Ahimaaz ran along the valley road and got ahead of the Sudanese messenger.", "24": "David was sitting between the two gates while the watchman walked along the roof of the gate by the wall. As he looked, he saw a man running alone. ", "25": "The watchman called and alerted the king. \u201cIf he's alone,\u201d the king said, \u201che has good news to tell.\u201d The runner continued to come closer.", "26": "When the watchman saw another man running, the watchman called, \u201cThere's another man running alone.\u201d The king said, \u201cThis one is also bringing good news.\u201d", "27": "The watchman said, \u201cIt seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz, Zadok's son.\u201d \u201cHe's a good man,\u201d the king said. \u201cHe must be coming with good news.\u201d", "28": "Then Ahimaaz came up to the king, greeted him, and bowed down in front of him. Ahimaaz said, \u201cMay the Lord your God be praised. He has handed over the men who rebelled against Your Majesty.\u201d", "29": "\u201cIs the young man Absalom alright?\u201d the king asked. Ahimaaz answered, \u201cI saw a lot of confusion when Joab sent me away, but I didn't know what it meant.\u201d", "30": "\u201cStep aside, and stand here,\u201d the king said. He stepped aside and stood there.", "31": "Then the Sudanese messenger came. \u201cGood news for Your Majesty!\u201d he said. \u201cToday the Lord has freed you from all who turned against you.\u201d", "32": "\u201cIs the young man Absalom alright?\u201d the king asked. The Sudanese messenger answered, \u201cMay your enemies and all who turned against you be like that young man!\u201d[c]", "33": "The king was shaken by the news. He went to the room above the gate and cried. \u201cMy son Absalom!\u201d he said as he went. \u201cMy son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d"}

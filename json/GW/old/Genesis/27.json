I don't know when I'm going to die. ", "3": "Now take your hunting equipment, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open country and hunt some wild game for me.

Bring it to me to eat so that I will bless you before I die.\u201d", "5": "Rebekah was listening while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau. When Esau went into the open country to hunt for some wild game to bring back, ", "6": "Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \u201cI've just heard your father speaking to your brother Esau. ", "7": "He said, 'Bring me some wild game, and prepare a good-tasting meal for me to eat so that I will bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die.' ", "8": "Now listen to me, Son, and do what I tell you. ", "9": "Go to the flock, and get me two good young goats. I'll prepare them as a good-tasting meal for your father, just the way he likes it.

Then I'll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.\u201d", "13": "His mother responded, \u201cLet any curse on you fall on me, Son. Just obey me and go! Get me the young goats.\u201d", "14": "He went and got them and brought them to his mother. She prepared a good-tasting meal, just the way his father liked it.

May people bow down to you. Be the master of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed. May those who bless you be blessed.\u201d", "30": "Isaac finished blessing Jacob. Jacob had barely left when his brother Esau came in from hunting.

I ate it before you came in. I blessed him, and he will stay blessed.\u201d", "34": "When Esau heard these words from his father, he shouted out a very loud and bitter cry and said to his father, \u201cBless me too, Father!\u201d", "35": "Isaac said, \u201cYour brother came and deceived me and has taken away your blessing.\u201d", "36": "Esau said, \u201cIsn't that why he's named Jacob? He's cheated me twice already: He took my rights as firstborn, and now he's taken my blessing.\u201d So he asked, \u201cHaven't you saved a blessing for me?\u201d", "37": "Isaac answered Esau, \u201cI have made him your master, and I have made all his brothers serve him. I've provided fresh grain and new wine for him. What is left for me to do for you, Son?\u201d", "38": "Esau asked, \u201cDo you have only one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!\u201d And Esau sobbed loudly.", "39": "His father Isaac answered him, \u201cThe place where you live will lack the fertile fields of the earth and the dew from the sky above.", "40": "You will use your sword to live, and you will serve your brother. But eventually you will gain your freedom[b] and break his yoke[c] off your neck.\u201d", "41": "So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him. Esau said to himself, \u201cThe time to mourn for my father is near. Then I'll kill my brother Jacob.\u201d", "42": "When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, \u201cWatch out! Your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you.", "43": "[d] 43\u00a0So now, Son, obey me. Quick! Run away to my brother Laban in Haran. ", "44": "Stay with him awhile, until your brother's anger cools down. ", "45": "When your brother's anger is gone and he has forgotten what you did to him, I'll send for you and get you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?\u201d", "46": "Rebekah said to Isaac, \u201cI can't stand Hittite women! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like one of those from around here, I might as well die.\u201d"}

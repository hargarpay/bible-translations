{"1": "In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. The bottom of his robe filled the temple. ", "2": "Angels[a] were standing above him. Each had six wings: With two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. ", "3": "They called to each other and said, \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of Armies! The whole earth is filled with his glory.\u201d", "4": "Their voices shook the foundations of the doorposts, and the temple filled with smoke.", "5": "So I said, \u201cOh, no! I'm doomed. Every word that passes through my lips is sinful. I live among people with sinful lips. I have seen the king, the Lord of Armies!\u201d", "6": "Then one of the angels flew to me. In his hand was a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs. ", "7": "He touched my mouth with it and said, \u201cThis has touched your lips. Your guilt has been taken away, and your sin has been forgiven.\u201d", "8": "Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, \u201cWhom will I send? Who will go for us?\u201d I said, \u201cHere I am. Send me!\u201d", "9": "And he said, \u201cGo and tell these people, 'No matter how closely you listen, you'll never understand. No matter how closely you look, you'll never see.'", "10": "Make these people close-minded. Plug their ears. Shut their eyes. Otherwise, they may see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their minds, and return and be healed.\u201d", "11": "I asked, \u201cHow long, O Lord?\u201d And he replied, \u201cUntil the cities lie in ruins with no one living in them, the houses have no people, and the land is completely desolate.", "12": "The Lord will send his people far away, and a large area in the middle of the land will be abandoned.", "13": "Even if one out of ten people is left in it, the land will be burned again. When a sacred oak or an oak is cut down, a stump is left. The holy seed will be the land's stump.\u201d"}

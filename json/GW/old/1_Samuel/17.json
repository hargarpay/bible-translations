The head of his spear was made of 15 pounds of iron. The man who carried his shield walked ahead of him.", "8": "Goliath stood and called to the Israelites, \u201cWhy do you form a battle line? Am I not a Philistine, and aren't you Saul's servants? Choose a man, and let him come down to fight me. ", "9": "If he can fight me and kill me, then we will be your slaves. But if I overpower him and kill him, then you will be our slaves and serve us.\u201d ", "10": "The Philistine added, \u201cI challenge the Israelite battle line today.

Then Eliab became angry with David. \u201cWhy did you come here,\u201d he asked him, \u201cand with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how overconfident and headstrong you are. You came here just to see the battle.\u201d", "29": "\u201cWhat have I done now?\u201d David snapped at him. \u201cDidn't I merely ask a question?\u201d ", "30": "He turned to face another man and asked the same question, and the other soldiers gave him the same answer.", "31": "What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, who then sent for him.

With a sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. ", "41": "The Philistine, preceded by the man carrying his shield, was coming closer and closer to David. ", "42": "When the Philistine got a good look at David, he despised him. After all, David was a young man with a healthy complexion and good looks.", "43": "The Philistine asked David, \u201cAm I a dog that you come to attack me with sticks?\u201d So the Philistine called on his gods to curse David.

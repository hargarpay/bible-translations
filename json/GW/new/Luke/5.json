Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowd from the boat.", "4": "When he finished speaking, he told Simon, \u201cTake the boat into deep water, and lower your nets to catch some fish.\u201d", "5": "Simon answered, \u201cTeacher, we worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets.\u201d", "6": "After the men had done this, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear. ", "7": "So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. Their partners came and filled both boats until the boats nearly sank.", "8": "When Simon Peter saw this, he knelt in front of Jesus and said, \u201cLeave me, Lord! I'm a sinful person!\u201d ", "9": "Simon and everyone who was with him were amazed to see the large number of fish they had caught. ", "10": "James and John, who were Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners, were also amazed. Jesus told Simon, \u201cDon't be afraid.

He's dishonoring God! Who besides God can forgive sins?\u201d", "22": "Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, \u201cWhat are you thinking? ", "23": "Is it easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

Praising God, he went home.", "26": "Everyone was amazed and praised God. They were filled with awe and said, \u201cWe've seen things today we can hardly believe!\u201d", "27": "After that, Jesus left. He saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in a tax office. Jesus said to him, \u201cFollow me!\u201d ", "28": "So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.", "29": "Levi held a large reception at his home for Jesus. A huge crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.", "30": "The Pharisees and their experts in Moses' Teachings complained to Jesus' disciples. They asked, \u201cWhy do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\u201d", "31": "Jesus answered them, \u201cHealthy people don't need a doctor; those who are sick do. ", "32": "I've come to call sinners to change the way they think and act, not to call people who think they have God's approval.\u201d", "33": "They said to him, \u201cJohn's disciples frequently fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. But your disciples eat and drink.\u201d", "34": "Jesus asked them, \u201cCan you force wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them? ", "35": "The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. At that time they will fast.\u201d", "36": "He also used these illustrations: \u201cNo one tears a piece of cloth from a new coat to patch an old coat. Otherwise, the new cloth will tear the old. Besides, the patch from the new will not match the old. ", "37": "People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will make the skins burst.

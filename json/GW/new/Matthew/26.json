", "4": "They made plans to arrest Jesus in an underhanded way and to kill him. ", "5": "But they said, \u201cWe shouldn't arrest him during the festival, or else there may be a riot among the people.\u201d", "6": "Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon, a man who had suffered from a skin disease. ", "7": "While Jesus was sitting there, a woman went to him with a bottle of very expensive perfume and poured it on his head.", "8": "The disciples were irritated when they saw this. They asked, \u201cWhy did she waste it like this? ", "9": "It could have been sold for a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.\u201d", "10": "Since Jesus knew what was going on, he said to them, \u201cWhy are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me. ", "11": "You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me with you. ", "12": "She poured this perfume on my body before it is placed in a tomb.

He said to them, \u201cStay here while I go over there and pray.\u201d", "37": "He took Peter and Zebedee's two sons with him. He was beginning to feel deep anguish.

The one who is betraying me is near.\u201d", "47": "Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, arrived. A large crowd carrying swords and clubs was with him. They were from the chief priests and leaders of the people. ", "48": "Now, the traitor had given them a signal. He said, \u201cThe one I kiss is the man you want.

All who use a sword will be killed by a sword. ", "53": "Don't you think that I could call on my Father to send more than twelve legions of angels to help me now? ", "54": "How, then, are the Scriptures to be fulfilled that say this must happen?\u201d", "55": "At that time Jesus said to the crowd, \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? I used to sit teaching in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn't arrest me then.

", "61": "They stated, \u201cThis man said, 'I can tear down God's temple and rebuild it in three days.'\u201d", "62": "The chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, \u201cDon't you have any answer to what these men testify against you?\u201d", "63": "But Jesus was silent. Then the chief priest said to him, \u201cSwear an oath in front of the living God and tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?\u201d", "64": "Jesus answered him, \u201cYes, I am. But I alone can guarantee that from now on you will see the Son of Man in the honored position\u2014the one next to God the Father on the heavenly throne. He will be coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d", "65": "Then the chief priest tore his robes in horror and said, \u201cHe has dishonored God! Why do we need any more witnesses? You've just heard him dishonor God! ", "66": "What's your verdict?\u201d They answered, \u201cHe deserves the death penalty!\u201d", "67": "Then they spit in his face, hit him with their fists, and some of them slapped him. ", "68": "They said, \u201cYou Christ, if you're a prophet, tell us who hit you.\u201d", "69": "Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him and said, \u201cYou, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.\u201d", "70": "But Peter denied it in front of them all by saying, \u201cI don't know what you're talking about.\u201d", "71": "As he went to the entrance, another female servant saw him. She told those who were there, \u201cThis man was with Jesus from Nazareth.\u201d", "72": "Again Peter denied it and swore with an oath, \u201cI don't know the man!\u201d", "73": "After a little while the men standing there approached Peter and said, \u201cIt's obvious you're also one of them. Your accent gives you away!\u201d", "74": "Then Peter began to curse and swear with an oath, \u201cI don't know the man!\u201d Just then a rooster crowed. ", "75": "Peter remembered what Jesus had said: \u201cBefore a rooster crows, you will say three times that you don't know me.\u201d Then Peter went outside and cried bitterly."}

While Jesus was sitting there, a woman went to him. She had a bottle of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She opened the bottle and poured the perfume on his head.", "4": "Some who were there were irritated and said to one another, \u201cWhy was the perfume wasted like this? ", "5": "This perfume could have been sold for a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.\u201d So they said some very unkind things to her.", "6": "Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. ", "7": "You will always have the poor with you and can help them whenever you want. But you will not always have me with you. ", "8": "She did what she could. She came to pour perfume on my body before it is placed in a tomb.

", "11": "They were pleased to hear what Judas had to say and promised to give him money. So he kept looking for a chance to betray Jesus.", "12": "Killing the Passover lamb was customary on the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples asked Jesus, \u201cWhere do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?\u201d", "13": "He sent two of his disciples and told them, \u201cGo into the city. You will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him.

", "15": "He will take you upstairs and show you a large room. The room will be completely furnished. Get everything ready for us there.\u201d", "16": "The disciples left. They went into the city and found everything as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.", "17": "When evening came, Jesus arrived with the twelve apostles.", "18": "While they were at the table eating, Jesus said, \u201cI can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me!\u201d", "19": "Feeling hurt, they asked him one by one, \u201cYou don't mean me, do you?\u201d", "20": "He said to them, \u201cIt's one of you twelve, someone dipping his hand into the bowl with me. ", "21": "The Son of Man is going to die as the Scriptures say he will. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for that person if he had never been born.\u201d", "22": "While they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread, gave it to them, and said, \u201cTake this. This is my body.\u201d", "23": "Then he took a cup, spoke a prayer of thanksgiving, and gave the cup to them. They all drank from it.

Scripture says, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'", "28": "\u201cBut after I am brought back to life, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.\u201d", "29": "Peter said to him, \u201cEven if everyone else abandons you, I won't.\u201d", "30": "Jesus said to Peter, \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Tonight, before a rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don't know me.\u201d", "31": "But Peter said very strongly, \u201cEven if I have to die with you, I will never say that I don't know you.\u201d All the other disciples said the same thing.", "32": "Then they came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, \u201cStay here while I pray.\u201d", "33": "He took Peter, James, and John with him and began to feel distressed and anguished. ", "34": "He said to them, \u201cMy anguish is so great that I feel as if I'm dying. Wait here, and stay awake.\u201d", "35": "After walking a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible he might not have to suffer what was ahead of him.

He said to Peter, \u201cSimon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you stay awake for one hour? ", "38": "Stay awake, and pray that you won't be tempted. You want to do what's right, but you're weak.\u201d", "39": "He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before. ", "40": "He found them asleep because they couldn't keep their eyes open. They didn't even know what they should say to him.", "41": "He came back a third time and said to them, \u201cYou might as well sleep now. It's all over.[c] The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners. ", "42": "Get up! Let's go! The one who is betraying me is near.\u201d", "43": "Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, arrived. A crowd carrying swords and clubs was with him. They were from the chief priests, the experts in Moses' Teachings, and the leaders of the people. ", "44": "Now, the traitor had given them a signal. He said, \u201cThe one I kiss is the man you want. Arrest him, and guard him closely as you take him away.\u201d", "45": "Then Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, \u201cRabbi!\u201d and kissed him.", "46": "Some men took hold of Jesus and arrested him. ", "47": "One of those standing there pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the chief priest's servant.", "48": "Jesus asked them, \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? ", "49": "I used to teach in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn't arrest me then. But what the Scriptures say must come true.\u201d", "50": "Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away.", "51": "A certain young man was following Jesus. He had nothing on but a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him, ", "52": "but he left the linen sheet behind and ran away naked.", "53": "The men took Jesus to the chief priest. All the chief priests, the leaders, and the experts in Moses' Teachings had gathered together. ", "54": "Peter followed him at a distance and went into the chief priest's courtyard. He sat with the guards and warmed himself facing the glow of a fire.", "55": "The chief priests and the whole Jewish council were searching for some testimony against Jesus in order to execute him. But they couldn't find any. ", "56": "Many gave false testimony against him, but their statements did not agree.", "57": "Then some men stood up and gave false testimony against him. They said, ", "58": "\u201cWe heard him say, 'I'll tear down this temple made by humans, and in three days I'll build another temple, one not made by human hands.'\u201d ", "59": "But their testimony did not agree even on this point.", "60": "So the chief priest stood up in the center and asked Jesus, \u201cDon't you have any answer to what these men testify against you?\u201d", "61": "But he was silent. The chief priest asked him again, \u201cAre you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?\u201d", "62": "Jesus answered, \u201cYes, I am, and you will see the Son of Man in the honored position\u2014the one next to God the Father on the heavenly throne. He will be coming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d", "63": "The chief priest tore his clothes in horror and said, \u201cWhy do we need any more witnesses? ", "64": "You've heard him dishonor God! What's your verdict?\u201d All of them condemned him with the death sentence. ", "65": "Some of them began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him with their fists. They said to him, \u201cProphesy!\u201d Even the guards took him and slapped him.", "66": "Peter was in the courtyard. One of the chief priest's female servants ", "67": "saw Peter warming himself. She looked at him and said, \u201cYou, too, were with Jesus from Nazareth!\u201d", "68": "But Peter denied it by saying, \u201cI don't know him, and I don't understand what you're talking about.\u201d He went to the entrance. Then a rooster crowed.[d]", "69": "The servant saw him. Once again she said to those who were standing around, \u201cThis man is one of them!\u201d ", "70": "Peter again denied it. After a little while the men standing there said to Peter again, \u201cIt's obvious you're one of them. You're a Galilean!\u201d", "71": "Then Peter began to curse and swear with an oath, \u201cI don't know this man you're talking about!\u201d ", "72": "Just then a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered that Jesus said to him, \u201cBefore a rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don't know me.\u201d Then Peter began to cry very hard."}

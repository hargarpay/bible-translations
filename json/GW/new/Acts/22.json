My education was in the strict laws handed down by our ancestors. I was as devoted to God as all of you are today. ", "4": "I persecuted people who followed the way of Christ: I tied up men and women and put them into prison until they were executed. ", "5": "The chief priest and the entire council of our leaders can prove that I did this. In fact, they even gave me letters to take to the Jewish community in the city of Damascus.

Why are you persecuting me?'", "8": "\u201cI answered, 'Who are you, sir?' \u201cThe person told me, 'I'm Jesus from Nazareth, the one you're persecuting.'", "9": "\u201cThe men who were with me saw the light but didn't understand what the person who was speaking to me said.", "10": "\u201cThen I asked, 'What do you want me to do, Lord?' \u201cThe Lord told me, 'Get up! Go into the city of Damascus, and you'll be told everything I've arranged for you to do.'", "11": "\u201cI was blind because the light had been so bright.

I approved of his death and guarded the coats of those who were murdering him.'", "21": "\u201cBut the Lord told me, 'Go! I'll send you on a mission. You'll go far away to people who aren't Jewish.'\u201d", "22": "Up to that point the mob listened. Then they began to shout, \u201cKill him! The world doesn't need a man like this.

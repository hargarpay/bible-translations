They have the Lord's glory, the pledges,[a] Moses' Teachings, the true worship, and the promises. ", "5": "The Messiah is descended from their ancestors according to his human nature. The Messiah is God over everything, forever blessed. Amen.", "6": "Now it is not as though God's word has failed. Clearly, not everyone descended from Israel is part of Israel ", "7": "or a descendant of Abraham. However, as Scripture says, \u201cThrough Isaac your descendants will carry on your name.\u201d ", "8": "This means that children born by natural descent from Abraham are not necessarily God's children. Instead, children born by the promise are considered Abraham's descendants.", "9": "For example, this is what the promise said, \u201cI will come back at the right time, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d ", "10": "The same thing happened to Rebekah. Rebekah became pregnant by our ancestor Isaac. ", "11": "Before the children had been born or had done anything good or bad, Rebekah was told that the older child would serve the younger one.

That's unthinkable! ", "15": "For example, God said to Moses, \u201cI will be kind to anyone I want to. I will be merciful to anyone I want to.\u201d ", "16": "Therefore, God's choice does not depend on a person's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.", "17": "For example, Scripture says to Pharaoh, \u201cI put you here for this reason: to demonstrate my power through you and to spread my name throughout the earth.\u201d ", "18": "Therefore, if God wants to be kind to anyone, he will be. If he wants to make someone stubborn, he will.", "19": "You may ask me, \u201cWhy does God still find fault with anyone?

He can make something for a special occasion or something for everyday use from the same lump of clay.", "22": "If God wants to demonstrate his anger and reveal his power, he can do it.

{"1": "Therefore let us fear, while there[a] remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of it. ", "2": "For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us[b], just as those also did, but the message they heard[c] did not benefit them, because they[d] were not united with those who heard it in faith. ", "3": "For we who have believed enter into rest,[e] just as he has said, \u201cAs I swore in my anger, 'They will never enter[f] into my rest.'\u201d[g] And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.

{"1": "Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who when I am present in person[a] am humble among you, but when I[b] am absent am bold toward you\u2014", "2": "now I ask when I[c] am present that I will not need to be bold with the confidence with which I propose to show boldness toward some who consider us as behaving according to the flesh. ", "3": "For although we[d] are living in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh, ", "4": "for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses, tearing down arguments ", "5": "and all pride that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. ", "6": "And we are ready[e] to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is completed.", "7": "You are looking at things according to appearance. If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ's, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself is, so also are we.

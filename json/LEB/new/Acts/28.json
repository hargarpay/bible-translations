", "2": "And the local inhabitants showed extraordinary[b] kindness to us, for they lit a fire and[c] welcomed us all, because of the rain that had begun and because of the cold. ", "3": "And when[d] Paul had gathered a large number of sticks and was placing them[e] on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and[f] fastened itself on his hand. ", "4": "And when the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying[g] to one another, \u201cDoubtless this man is a murderer whom, although he[h] was rescued from the sea, Justice[i] has not permitted to live!\u201d ", "5": "He, in turn, shook off the creature into the fire and[j] suffered no harm. ", "6": "But they were expecting that he was going to swell up[k] or suddenly to fall down dead. So after[l] they had waited for a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and[m] began saying[n] that he was a god.", "7": "Now in the regions around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island, named[o] Publius, who welcomed us and[p] entertained us[q] hospitably for three days. ", "8": "And it happened that the father of Publius was lying down, afflicted with fever and dysentery. Paul went[r] to him[s] and after[t] praying, he placed his[u] hands on him and[v] healed him.

", "10": "They also honored us with many honors, and when we[x] were putting out to sea, they gave us[y] the things we needed.[z]", "11": "Now after three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian one with the twin gods Castor and Pollux as its insignia.[aa] ", "12": "And putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there three days. ", "13": "From there we got underway[ab] and[ac] arrived at Rhegium, and after one day a south wind came up and[ad] on the second day we came to Puteoli, ", "14": "where we found brothers, and[ae] were implored to stay with them seven days. And in this way we came to Rome. ", "15": "And from there the brothers, when they[af] heard the news about us, came to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns. When he[ag] saw them, Paul gave thanks to God and[ah] took courage. ", "16": "And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.", "17": "Now it happened that after three days, he called together those who were the most prominent of the Jews. And when[ai] they had assembled, he said to them, \u201cMen and brothers, although[aj] I had done nothing against our[ak] people or the customs of our fathers, from Jerusalem I was delivered as a prisoner into the hands of the Romans, ", "18": "who, when they[al] had examined me, were wanting to release me,[am] because there was no basis for an accusation worthy of death with me.

", "24": "And some were convinced by[au] what was said, but others refused to believe. ", "25": "So being in disagreement with one another, they began to leave after[av] Paul made one statement: \u201cThe Holy Spirit spoke rightly through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, ", "26": "saying, 'Go to this people and say, \u201cYou will keep on hearing[aw] and will never understand, and you will keep on seeing[ax] and will never perceive.", "27": "For the heart of this people has become dull, and with their[ay] ears they hear with difficulty, and they have shut their eyes, lest they see with their[az] eyes, and hear with their[ba] ears, and understand with their[bb] heart, and turn, and I would heal them.\u201d'[bc]", "28": "Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They also will listen!\u201d[bd]", "30": "So he stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him, ", "31": "proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance."}

", "3": "Paul wanted this one to go with him, and he took him[b] and[c] circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek. ", "4": "And as they went through the towns, they passed on to them to observe the rules that had been decided by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. ", "5": "So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were growing in number every day.", "6": "And they traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in Asia.[d] ", "7": "And when they[e] came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. ", "8": "So going through Mysia, they went down to Troas. ", "9": "And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: a certain Macedonian man was standing there and imploring him and saying, \u201cCome over to Macedonia and[f] help us!\u201d ", "10": "And when he had seen the vision, we wanted at once to go away to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.", "11": "So putting out to sea from Troas, we sailed a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis, ", "12": "and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. And we were staying in this city for some days. ", "13": "And on the day of the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate beside the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and[g] spoke to the women assembled there.

", "30": "And he brought them outside and[ai] said, \u201cSirs, what must I do so that I can be saved?\u201d ", "31": "And they said, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household!\u201d ", "32": "And they spoke the message of the Lord to him, together with all those in his house.

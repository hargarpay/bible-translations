", "4": "Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself was about to go there[c] in a short time. ", "5": "So he said, \u201cLet those among you who are prominent go down with me,[d] and[e] if there is any wrong in the man, let them bring charges against him.\u201d", "6": "And after he[f] had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and[g] gave orders for Paul to be brought. ", "7": "And when[h] he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges that they were not able to prove, ", "8": "while[i] Paul said in his defense, \u201cNeither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned with reference to anything!\u201d ", "9": "But Festus, because he[j] wanted to do a favor for the Jews, answered and[k] said to Paul, \u201cAre you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me there concerning these things?\u201d ", "10": "But Paul said, \u201cI am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well. ", "11": "If then I am doing wrong[l] and have done anything deserving death, I am not trying to avoid[m] dying. But if there is nothing true of the things which these people are accusing me, no one can give me up to them.

{"1": "And it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland regions and[a] came[b] to Ephesus and found some disciples. ", "2": "And he said to them, \u201cDid you receive the Holy Spirit when you[c] believed?\u201d And they said to him, \u201cBut we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit!\u201d ", "3": "And he said, \u201cInto what then were you baptized?\u201d And they said, \u201cInto the baptism of John.\u201d ", "4": "And Paul said, \u201cJohn baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the one who was to come after him\u2014that is, in Jesus.\u201d ", "5": "And when they[d] heard this,[e] they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. ", "6": "And when[f] Paul laid hands[g] on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they began to speak[h] in tongues and to prophesy.

", "10": "And this took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia[n] heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.", "11": "And God was performing extraordinary[o] miracles by the hands of Paul, ", "12": "so that even handkerchiefs or work aprons that had touched his skin[p] were carried away to those who were sick, and their[q] diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.[r] ", "13": "But some itinerant Jewish exorcists also attempted to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, \u201cI adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches!\u201d ", "14": "(Now seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.)

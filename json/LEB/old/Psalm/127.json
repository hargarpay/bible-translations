Unless Yahweh guards a city, a guard watches in vain.", "2": "It is in vain for you who rise early and sit late, eating the bread of anxious toil, when thus he[b] provides[c] for his beloved in his sleep.[d]", "3": "Look, children[e] are the heritage[f] of Yahweh; the fruit of the womb is a reward.", "4": "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children[g] of one's youth.", "5": "Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them.[h] They shall not be put to shame when they speak with enemies at the gate."}

{"1": "Who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?", "2": "For[a] he went[b] up like a shoot before him, and like a root from dry ground. He had no form and no majesty that[c] we should see him, and no appearance that[d] we should take pleasure in him.", "3": "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering, and acquainted with[e] sickness, and like one from whom others hide their faces,[f] he was despised, and we did not hold him in high regard.", "4": "However, he was the one who lifted up our sicknesses, and he carried our pain, yet[g] we ourselves assumed him stricken, struck down by God and afflicted.", "5": "But[h] he was pierced[i] because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the chastisement for[j] our peace[k] was upon him, and by his wounds[l] we were healed.[m]", "6": "All of us have wandered about like sheep; we each have turned to his own way; and Yahweh let fall on him the iniquity of us all.", "7": "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet[n] he did not open his mouth; he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep is dumb before its shearers, so[o] he did not open his mouth.", "8": "He was taken by restraint of justice, and who concerned himself with his generation? For he was cut off from the land of the living; he received a blow because of the transgression of my people.", "9": "He made[p] his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.", "10": "Yet[q] Yahweh was pleased to crush him; he made him sick.[r] If she[s] places[t] his life a guilt offering,[u] he will see offspring. He will prolong days, and the will of Yahweh will succeed in his hand.", "11": "From the trouble of his life[v] he will see;[w] he will be satisfied. In his knowledge, the righteous one, my servant, shall declare many righteous,[x] and he is the one who will bear their iniquities.", "12": "Therefore, I will divide to him a portion among the many,[y] and with the strong ones he will divide bounty, because[z] he poured his life out to death and was counted with the transgressors; and[aa] he was the one who bore the sin of many and will intercede for the transgressors."}

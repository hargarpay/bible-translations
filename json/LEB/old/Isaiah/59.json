{"1": "Look! The hand of Yahweh is not too short to save,[a] and his ear is not too dull to hear.[b]", "2": "Rather, your iniquities have been barriers[c] between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, from hearing.", "3": "For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, your tongue speaks wickedness.", "4": "There is nobody who pleads with[d] justice, and there is nobody who judges with honesty. They rely on nothing and speak vanity. They conceive trouble and beget iniquity;", "5": "they hatch viper eggs, and they weave a spider web. One who eats their eggs dies, and that which is pressed is hatched as a serpent.", "6": "Their webs cannot become clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds[e] of violence are in their hands.", "7": "Their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and destruction are in their highways.", "8": "They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their firm paths. They have made their paths crooked for themselves; everyone who walks[f] in it knows no peace.", "9": "Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We wait for light, but[g] look! there is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.", "10": "We grope like the blind along a wall, and we grope as without[h] eyes. We stumble at noon as in the twilight; among the strong we are like the dead.", "11": "We all groan like bears, and we coo mutteringly like doves. We wait for justice, but[i] there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.", "12": "For our transgressions are numerous before you, and our sins testify[j] against us. Indeed, our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities:", "13": "transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following[k] our God; speaking oppression and falsehood, conceiving and uttering words of deception from the heart.", "14": "And justice is pushed back, and righteousness stands afar; for truth stumbles in the public square, and straightforwardness is unable to enter,", "15": "and truth is missing, and he who turns aside from evil is plundered. And Yahweh saw, and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice", "16": "And he saw that there was no man, and he was appalled that there was no one who intercedes, so[l] his arm came to assist him, and his righteousness was what[m] sustained him.", "17": "And he put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head, and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and he wrapped himself in zeal as in a robe.", "18": "According to deeds, so he will repay; wrath to his enemies, requital to those who are his enemies.[n] He will repay requital to the coastlands.", "19": "So[o] they shall fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the sunrise, for he will come like a narrow stream; the wind of Yahweh drives it on.", "20": "\u201cAnd a redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn away from transgression,\u201d declares[p] Yahweh.", "21": "\u201cAnd as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh: my spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have placed in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, or[q] from the mouths[r] of your children,[s] or[t] from the mouths[u] of your children's children,\u201d[v] says Yahweh, \u201cfrom now on and forever.\u201d"}

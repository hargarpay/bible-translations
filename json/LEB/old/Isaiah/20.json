{"1": "In the year the commander-in-chief came[a] to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and he took it, ", "2": "at that time, Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, \u201cGo and loosen the sackcloth from your loins, and take off your sandals[b] from your feet,\u201d and he had done so, walking naked and barefoot.", "3": "Then[c] Yahweh said, \u201cJust as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush, ", "4": "so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives[d] of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks,[e] the shame of Egypt.", "5": "And they shall be dismayed, and they shall be ashamed because of Cush, their hope, and because of Egypt, their pride.", "6": "And the inhabitant[f] of the coastland will say this on that day: 'Look! This is our hope to whom we fled for help, to be delivered from[g] the king of Assyria, and how shall we escape?'\u201d"}

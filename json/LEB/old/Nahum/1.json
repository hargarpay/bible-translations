{"1": "The oracle concerning Nineveh\u2014 the scroll of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:", "2": "Yahweh is a jealous God and avenging; Yahweh is avenging and full of wrath.[a] Yahweh takes vengeance against his enemies; he rages against his adversaries.", "3": "Yahweh is slow to anger but great in power; he will certainly not allow the guilty to go unpunished. He marches[b] in storm wind and in gale; storm clouds are the dust of his feet.", "4": "He rebukes the sea and he dries up the rivers; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither;[c] the blossom of Lebanon languishes.", "5": "Mountains quake before him; the hills shake apart.[d] The earth heaves before him\u2014 the world and all her inhabitants.", "6": "His indignation\u2014who can stand before it? Who can endure his fierce anger?[e] His wrath is poured out like fire; rocks are shattered before[f] him.", "7": "Yahweh is good\u2014a refuge in the day of distress; he knows those who take refuge in him.", "8": "But with a rushing torrent he will bring Nineveh to an end; he will chase his enemies into darkness.", "9": "What[g] do you plot against Yahweh? He will completely destroy it;[h] trouble will not rise up a second time!", "10": "For like entangled thorns, and like their drink which is drunk, they will be consumed like fully dry chaff.", "11": "From you goes out one who plots evil against Yahweh, one who plans wickedness.", "12": "Yahweh says this: \u201cEven though they are powerful and likewise many, even so they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you,[i] I will afflict you[j] no longer.", "13": "And now, I will break his yoke from upon you; I will snap your bonds.\u201d", "14": "Yahweh has commanded concerning you: \u201cYour name will no longer be sown. I will cut off the idols and images[k] from the temple[l] of your gods; I will send you to the grave[m] because you are worthless.\u201d", "15": "[n] Look! On the mountains! The feet of the one who brings good tidings, the one who proclaims peace! \u201cCelebrate a festival, O Judah, Fulfill your vows! For he will not invade you again; the wicked one is cut off completely!\u201d"}

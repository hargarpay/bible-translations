", "2": "And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens[b] were closed, and the rain from the heavens[c] was restrained. ", "3": "And the waters receded from the earth gradually,[d] and the waters abated at the end of one hundred and fifty days.

", "9": "But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the earth.

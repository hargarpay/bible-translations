", "2": "The Philistines lined up for the battle to meet Israel, and the battle was prolonged[a] until Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who[b] killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.[c] ", "3": "When the army[d] came back to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, \u201cWhy has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to us from Shiloh so that it may come into our midst and deliver[e] us from the hand of our enemies.\u201d ", "4": "So the army sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts who sits between the cherubim.

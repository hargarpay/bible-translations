", "2": "And then[b] one day when Eli was lying in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow weak so that he was not able to see) ", "3": "and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple[c] of Yahweh where the ark of God was. ", "4": "Then Yahweh called out to Samuel and he said, \u201cHere I am!\u201d ", "5": "And he ran to Eli and said, \u201cHere I am, because you called me.\u201d But he said, \u201cI did not call you. Go back and lie down.\u201d So he went and lay down.

If he calls[d] to you, then you must say, 'Speak Yahweh, because your servant is listening.'\u201d So Samuel went and lay down in his place.", "10": "Then Yahweh came and stood there and called out as before,[e] \u201cSamuel! Samuel!\u201d And Samuel said, \u201cSpeak, because your servant is listening.\u201d ", "11": "So Yahweh said to Samuel, \u201cLook, I am doing something in Israel which will cause[f] the two ears of everyone who hears it to tingle.

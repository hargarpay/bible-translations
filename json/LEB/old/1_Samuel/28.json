And Saul had expelled the mediums[c] and the soothsayers from the land.) ", "4": "Then the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem, so Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa. ", "5": "When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. ", "6": "And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim[d] or by the prophets. ", "7": "So Saul said to his servants, \u201cSearch for me a woman who is a medium[e] so that I may go to her and inquire of her.\u201d His servants said to him, \u201cLook there is a woman who is a medium in Endor.\u201d ", "8": "So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went with two of his men.[f] And they came to the woman by night and he said, \u201cPlease consult a spirit for me through the ritual pit,[g] and bring up for me the one whom I tell you.\u201d ", "9": "But the woman said to him, \u201cLook, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums[h] and the soothsayers from the land! Why are you setting a trap for my life to kill me?\u201d ", "10": "Then Saul swore to her by Yahweh, \u201cAs Yahweh lives,[i] you will not be punished[j] for this thing.\u201d ", "11": "So the woman asked, \u201cWhom shall I bring up for you?\u201d He said, \u201cBring up Samuel for me.\u201d ", "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saul, \u201cWhy did you deceive me? You are Saul!\u201d ", "13": "The king said to her, \u201cDo not be afraid! What do you see?\u201d And the woman said to Saul, \u201cI see a god[k] coming up from the ground!\u201d ", "14": "Then he said to her, \u201cWhat is his appearance?\u201d She said, \u201cAn old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.\u201d[l] Then Saul realized that it was Samuel, and he knelt with his face to the ground and bowed down.", "15": "Then Samuel said to Saul, \u201cWhy have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\u201d And Saul said, \u201cI am in distress![m] For the Philistines are about to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not by the prophets[n] or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do.\u201d ", "16": "Then Samuel said, \u201cWhy do you ask me, since Yahweh has turned away from you and has become your enemy? ", "17": "Yahweh has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David. ", "18": "Because you did not obey[o] Yahweh and did not carry out the fierce anger of his wrath[p] against Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you today.

", "22": "So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and you eat so that you will have strength[u] in you when you go on your[v] way.\u201d ", "23": "But he refused and said, \u201cI will not eat!\u201d However, his servants urged him, and the woman also. So he listened to what they said,[w] and he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. ", "24": "Now the woman had a fattened bull calf in the house, so she quickly slaughtered it[x] and took flour, kneaded dough, and baked him some unleavened bread. ", "25": "She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that very night."}

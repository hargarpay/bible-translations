{"1": "When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. ", "2": "The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. ", "3": "But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, they took bribes, and they perverted justice.", "4": "So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. ", "5": "They said to him, \u201cLook, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge[a] us, like all the nations. ", "6": "But the matter was displeasing to Samuel[b] when they said, \u201cGive us a king to judge[c] us,\u201d so Samuel prayed to Yahweh.", "7": "Then Yahweh said to Samuel, \u201cListen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. ", "8": "Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods\u2014so they are doing to you also.

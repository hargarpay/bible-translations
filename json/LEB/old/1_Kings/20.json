All the desire of your eyes they will lay hands on[a] and take it away.'\u201d", "7": "Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, \u201cPlease know and realize that this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my women, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not withhold anything from him.\u201d ", "8": "All of the elders and all of the people said to him, \u201cDo not listen and do not consent.\u201d ", "9": "So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, \u201cSay to my lord the king, 'All that you demanded from your servant at the first, I will do, but this thing I am not able to do.'\u201d Then the messengers went and made a report to him.[b] ", "10": "Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, \u201cThus may the gods do to me and thus may they add if the dust of Samaria is sufficient for the hollow of a hand for all of the people who are at my feet.\u201d ", "11": "The king of Israel answered and said, \u201cTell him, 'Let not him who girds on his armor boast as one who takes off his armor.'\u201d ", "12": "It happened at the moment he heard this word, he and the kings were drinking in the tents.[c] He said to his servants, \u201cGet ready to attack.\u201d So they got ready to attack the city.", "13": "Suddenly a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, \u201cThus says Yahweh: 'Have you seen all this great crowd? Behold, I am giving it into your hand today, that you may know that I am Yahweh.'\u201d ", "14": "Ahab said, \u201cBy whom?\u201d And he said, \u201cThus says Yahweh: 'By the servants of the commanders of the provinces.'\u201d He asked, \u201cWho will begin the battle?\u201d And he said, \u201cYou.\u201d ", "15": "So he mustered the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two.

", "25": "You must muster an army for yourself as the army you have lost,[f] and horses and chariots as the horses and chariots you lost, then we will fight them in the plain. Surely we will be stronger than they.\u201d So he listened to their voice and did so.", "26": "It happened at the turning of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram and went up to Aphek for the war with Israel.

You may set up streets with stalls for yourself in Damascus just as my father set up in Samaria.\u201d Then Ahab said, \u201cOn these terms[l] I will let you go,\u201d So he made a covenant with him and let him go.", "35": "A certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his fellow countryman, \u201cBy the word of Yahweh, please strike me.\u201d But the man refused to strike him.", "36": "He said to him, \u201cBecause you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, look, as you now are going from me, a lion will kill you.\u201d When he went from beside him, the lion found him and killed him.

{"1": "It happened many days later that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah in the third year, saying, \u201cGo, present yourself to Ahab so that I may give rain on the surface of the earth.\u201d ", "2": "So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. ", "3": "Ahab summoned Obadiah who was over the house. (Now Obadiah was fearing Yahweh greatly. ", "4": "It had happened that when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties[a] in the cave and sustained them with food and water.) ", "5": "Ahab said to Obadiah, \u201cGo through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis.[b] Perhaps we may find green grass that we may keep horses and mules alive and that we might not lose any of the animals.\u201d ", "6": "So they divided the land for themselves in order to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.", "7": "It happened that Obadiah was on the way, and suddenly Elijah was there to meet him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, \u201cIs this you, my lord Elijah?\u201d ", "8": "He said to him, \u201cI am. Go, say to your lord, 'Elijah is here.'\u201d ", "9": "He said, \u201cHow have I sinned that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me? ", "10": "As Yahweh your God lives,[c] surely there is not a nation or a kingdom to which my lord has not sent me to seek you. If they would say, 'He is not here,' then he would make the kingdom or the nation swear that it could not find you. ", "11": "Now you are saying, 'Go, say to your lord: \u201cElijah is here.\u201d' ", "12": "And it will happen that I will go from you and the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you up to where I do not know. Then I will come to tell Ahab, but he will not find you, and then he will kill me, even though your servant has feared Yahweh from my youth. ", "13": "Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh? I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Yahweh by fifties[d] in the cave, and I sustained them with food and water. ", "14": "Now you are saying, 'Go, say to your lord: \u201cElijah is here,\u201d' and he will kill me.\u201d ", "15": "Elijah said, \u201cAs Yahweh of hosts lives,[e] before whom I stand, I will certainly show myself to him today.\u201d", "16": "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and he told him, so Ahab went to meet Elijah. ", "17": "When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, \u201cIs this you who throws Israel into confusion?\u201d ", "18": "He said, \u201cI did not throw Israel into confusion; rather you and the house of your father have by forsaking the commands of Yahweh when you went after the Baals! ", "19": "So then, send word and assemble all of Israel to me on Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at the table of Jezebel.\u201d", "20": "So Ahab sent word among the Israelites,[f] and he assembled the prophets to Mount Carmel. ", "21": "Elijah approached to all the people and said, \u201cHow long will you go limping over two opinions? If Yahweh is God, go after him; but if Baal, go after him.\u201d But the people did not answer him a word. ", "22": "Then Elijah said to the people, \u201cI alone am left a prophet of Yahweh, but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men. ", "23": "Let them give us two bulls, and let them choose for themselves one bull, cut him in pieces, and put it on the wood, but don't let them start a fire on it. I will prepare the other bull and set it on the wood, but I will put no fire on it. ", "24": "Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh, and it shall be that the god who answers by fire, he is God.\u201d[g] Then all the people answered and said, \u201cThe word is good!\u201d", "25": "Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \u201cChoose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are the majority, and call on the name of your god, but don't set fire under it.\u201d ", "26": "So they took the bull that he allowed to them, prepared it, and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, \u201cO Baal, answer us!\u201d But there was no voice and there was no answer, so they limped[h] about the altar which they had made. ", "27": "It happened at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, \u201cCall out with a loud voice, for he is a god! Perhaps he is meditating, or is using the bathroom,[i] or is on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep and must wake up!\u201d ", "28": "So they called out with a loud voice, and they cut themselves with swords and with spears as was their custom, until the blood poured out over them. ", "29": "It happened as noon passed, they raged until the time of the evening offering, but there was no voice, there was no answer, and no one paid attention.", "30": "Then Elijah said to all the people, \u201cCome near to me,\u201d so all the people came closer to him. He repaired the altar of Yahweh that had been destroyed. ", "31": "Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of God came, saying, \u201cIsrael shall be your name.\u201d ", "32": "With them, he built an altar in the name of Yahweh, and he made a trench which would have held[j] about two seahs of seed, all around the altar. ", "33": "And he arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces, and placed it on the wood.[k] Then he said, \u201cFill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.\u201d ", "34": "He said, \u201cDo it again!\u201d They did it again. He said, \u201cDo it a third time!\u201d So they did it a third time. ", "35": "The water went all around the altar, and the trench also was filled with water.", "36": "It happened at the offering of the evening oblation, Elijah the prophet went near, and he said, \u201cO Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that I have done all of these things by your words. ", "37": "Answer me, O Yahweh, answer me; that this people may know that you, O Yahweh, are God and that you have turned their hearts back again.\u201d ", "38": "Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and it consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; and the water which was in the trench it licked up! ", "39": "When all the people saw, they fell on their faces and said, \u201cYahweh, he is God! Yahweh, he is God!\u201d ", "40": "Then Elijah said to them, \u201cSeize the prophets of Baal; don't let any man of them escape!\u201d So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the wadi[l] of Kishon and killed them there.", "41": "Then Elijah said to Ahab, \u201cGo up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of the noise of rain.\u201d ", "42": "So Ahab went up to eat and to drink while Elijah went to the top of Carmel, bent down to the earth, and put his face between his knees. ", "43": "Then he said to his servant, \u201cPlease go and look in the direction of the sea.\u201d So he went up and looked; then he said, \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d Then he said, \u201cGo back,\u201d seven times. ", "44": "It happened that at the seventh time, he said, \u201cLook, there is a small cloud, as the hand of a man, coming up from the sea.\u201d Then Elijah said, \u201cGo up, say to Ahab, 'Harness your horses and go down, lest the rain stop you.'\u201d ", "45": "In no time[m] the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was heavy rain. Ahab rode and he went to Jezreel, ", "46": "but the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab as one comes to Jezreel."}

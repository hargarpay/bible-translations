And she happened by chance upon the tract of field belonging to[d] Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech. ", "4": "And look, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, \u201cMay Yahweh be with you.\u201d And they said to him, \u201cMay Yahweh bless you.\u201d ", "5": "And Boaz said to his servant in charge of the reapers,[e] \u201cTo whom does this young woman belong?\u201d ", "6": "And the servant in charge of the reapers[f] said, \u201cShe is a Moabite girl returning with Naomi from the countryside of Moab.

She is sitting for a little while in the house.\u201d[g]", "8": "And Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cListen carefully,[h] my daughter, go no longer to glean in another field. Moreover, do not leave from this one, but stay close[i] with my young women. ", "9": "Keep your eyes on the field that they reap and go after them. Have I not ordered the servants not to bother you? And if you get thirsty, you shall go to the containers and drink from where the servants have drawn.\u201d ", "10": "And she fell on her face and bowed down to the ground and said to him, \u201cWhy have I found favor in your eyes by recognizing me\u2014for I am a foreigner?\u201d ", "11": "And Boaz answered and said to her, \u201cAll that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband was fully told to me. How you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and you went to a people that you did not know before.[j] ", "12": "May Yahweh reward your work and may a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you came to take refuge.\u201d ", "13": "And she said, \u201cMay I find favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your servant,[k] and I am not one of your servants.\u201d", "14": "And Boaz said to her at mealtime,[l] \u201cCome here and eat from the bread and dip your morsel in the wine vinegar.\u201d So she sat beside the gleaners, and he offered to her roasted grain. And she ate and was satisfied, and she had some left over.

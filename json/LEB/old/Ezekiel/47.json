Every month[aa] it will bear early fruit, for its waters are going out from the sanctuary, and its fruit will be as food, and its leaf for healing.\u201d", "13": "Thus says the Lord Yahweh: \u201cThis is the boundary by which you shall distribute the land for the twelve[ab] tribes of Israel: Two shares shall be for Joseph.

{"1": "And then[a] in the eleventh[b] year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came[c] to me, saying,[d] ", "2": "\u201cSon of man,[e] say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his crowd,[f] 'To whom are you like in your greatness?", "3": "Look! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches[g] and a forest giving shade, and very high,[h] and its treetop was between the clouds.", "4": "Waters made it great, the deep made it grow high; its rivers were going all around its planting area,[i] and its channels it sent out to all of the trees of the field.", "5": "Therefore it became tall, with its height more than all of the trees of the field, and its branches became numerous, and its branches became long from its sending its shoots from abundant water.[j]", "6": "In its branches all the birds[k] of the heaven[l] made their nest, and under its branches all the animals[m] of the field gave birth, and in its shadow all the many nations lived.", "7": "And it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was toward much water.", "8": "Cedars in the garden of God could not be equal to it; fir trees[n] could not resemble its branches, and plane trees were not even like its branches; any tree even in the garden of God could not resemble it in its beauty.", "9": "I made it beautiful with the abundance of its branches, and all of the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it.'\u201d", "10": "Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: \u201cBecause[o] it was tall in height and it set its treetop between[p] thick clouds, and he took pride in his tallness,[q] ", "11": "then[r] I gave it into the hand of the leader of nations; he dealt thoroughly[s] with it according to its wickedness. I drove it out. ", "12": "And strangers cut it off, the most ruthless of nations, and they abandoned it. On the mountains and in all of the valleys its branches fell, and its branches were broken in all the river channels of the land, and all the peoples of the world went out from its shadow, and they abandoned it.

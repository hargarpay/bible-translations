", "4": "If we say, 'Let us go into the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; but if we sit here, we shall die. So then, come, let us fall into the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we shall live; but if they kill us, then we shall die.\u201d ", "5": "So they got up at dusk to go to the camp of the Arameans. They went up to the edge of the camp of the Arameans, and look, there was no man there! ", "6": "Now the Lord had caused the camp of the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, the sound of horses, and the sound of a great army. So they said to one another,[c] \u201cLook, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us!\u201d ", "7": "So they got up and fled at dusk and left their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives.

This day is a day of good news! If we are silent and wait until the light of morning, they will find us and we will be punished.[e] So then, come, let us go and tell the house of the king.\u201d ", "10": "When they came, they called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, saying, \u201cWe came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no man or the voice of a man there! Only the horses and the donkeys were tied up, and the tents were left as they were.\u201d ", "11": "Then the gatekeepers called and told it inside the house of the king. ", "12": "The king got up in the night and said to his servants, \u201cPlease let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. The Arameans know that we are hungry, so they went out from the camp to hide in the field, saying, 'When they go out from the city, we shall seize them alive and go into the city.'\u201d ", "13": "Then one of his servants replied and said, \u201cPlease let them take five of the remaining horses which remain in the city; behold, they are like all of the multitude of Israel that remain in it; they are like all the multitude of Israel who have perished.

Then the messengers returned and told the king.", "16": "So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. A seah of wheat flour went for a shekel and two seahs of barley went for a shekel according to the word of Yahweh.

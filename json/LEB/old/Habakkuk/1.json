{"1": "The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.", "2": "O Yahweh, how long shall I cry for help and you will not listen? How long will I cry out to you, \u201cViolence!\u201d and you will not save?", "3": "Why do you cause me to see evil while you look at trouble? Destruction and violence happen before me; contention and strife arise.", "4": "Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice does not go forth perpetually.[a] For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.", "5": "\u201cLook among the nations and see; be astonished and astounded. For a work is about to be done in your days that you will not believe if it is told.", "6": "For look! I am raising up the Chaldeans, the bitter and impetuous nation, the one who walks through the spacious places of earth to take possession of dwellings not belonging to it.[b]", "7": "They[c] are dreadful and awesome; their[d] justice and their[e] dignity proceed from themselves.[f]", "8": "Their[g] horses are more swift than leopards; they are more menacing than wolves at dusk. Their[h] horsemen gallop; their[i] horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle that is swift to devour.", "9": "All of them[j] come for violence, their faces pressing forward. They gather captives like the sand.", "10": "And they themselves scoff at kings and rulers are a joke to them. They laugh at every fortification, and they heap up earth and take it.", "11": "Then they sweep like the wind and pass on; they become guilty, whose might is their[k] god!\u201d", "12": "Are you not from of old, O Yahweh my God, my Holy One? You[l] shall not die. O Yahweh, you have marked them[m] for judgment; O Rock, you have established them[n] for reproof.", "13": "Your eyes are too pure to see evil, and you are not able to look at wrongdoing.[o] Why do you look at the treacherous? Why are you silent when the wicked swallows up someone more righteous than him?", "14": "You make humankind like fish of the sea, like crawling creatures that have no ruler among them.", "15": "He brings up all of them with a fishhook; he drags them up with a fishnet; he gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore, he rejoices and exults.", "16": "Therefore he sacrifices to his fishnet and makes offerings to his dragnet, for by them he makes a good living[p] and his food is rich.", "17": "Will he therefore empty his fishnet and continually kill nations without showing mercy?"}

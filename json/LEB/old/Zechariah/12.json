{"1": "An oracle. The word of Yahweh concerning Israel. \u201cThus declares[a] Yahweh, who stretches out the heavens, founds the earth, and forms the spirit of humankind in its midst:[b] ", "2": "'Look, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling for all the surrounding nations; it will also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem. ", "3": "And then[c] on that day I will make Jerusalem a stone weight[d] for all the peoples. All those lifting it up will grievously hurt themselves, and all the nations of the earth will assemble against it. ", "4": "On that day,' declares[e] Yahweh, 'I will strike every horse with confusion, and the one riding it with madness; but over the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open,[f] and I will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. ", "5": "And the clans of Judah will say to themselves,[g] \u201cThe inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to us,[h] through Yahweh of hosts, their God.\u201d", "6": "\u201c'On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a pan of fire among sticks of wood, and like a torch of fire among stalks[i] of grain, and they will devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, and Jerusalem will be inhabited again in its place, in Jerusalem. ", "7": "And Yahweh will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants[j] of Jerusalem may not be exalted over Judah.

", "11": "On that day the wailing will be great in Jerusalem, like the wailing for Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. ", "12": "And the land shall mourn, each clan by itself;[o] the clan of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; ", "13": "the clan of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves; ", "14": "and all those clans remaining, each clan by itself,[p] and their wives by themselves.'\u201d"}

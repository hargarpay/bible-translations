{"1": "Again Yahweh was angry with Israel, and he[a] incited David against them, saying, \u201cGo count Israel and Judah.\u201d ", "2": "The king said to Joab, the commander of the army who was with him: \u201cPlease go about through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people that I may know the number of the people.\u201d ", "3": "Then Joab said to the king, \u201cMay Yahweh your God increase the people a hundred times what they are[b] as the eyes of my lord the king are seeing. But my lord the king, why does he desire this thing?\u201d ", "4": "But the word of the king prevailed over Joab and over the commanders of the army, so Joab and the commanders of the army went out from before the king to count the people of Israel. ", "5": "They crossed over the Jordan and camped at Aroer to the south of the city, which was in the middle of the wadi of Gad, and up to Jazer.

Or three months of your fleeing from your enemies while he is pursuing you? Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider and decide what I must return to the one who sent me a word.\u201d ", "14": "Then David said to Gad, \u201cI am greatly distressed. Please let us fall into the hand of Yahweh, because he is great in his compassion; but into the hand of man don't let me fall.\u201d ", "15": "Then Yahweh sent a plague into Israel from the morning until the agreed time,[d] and from the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men died.", "16": "When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, Yahweh regretted about the evil, and he said to the angel who brought destruction among the people, \u201cEnough, now relax your hand.\u201d Now the angel of Yahweh was at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

", "25": "David built an altar to Yahweh there, and he offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then Yahweh responded to his prayer for the land and brought the plague to a halt from upon Israel."}

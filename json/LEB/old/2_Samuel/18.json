And the king said to the troops, \u201cI, even I, will certainly go out[d] with you.\u201d ", "3": "Then the troops said, \u201cYou will not go out, for if we must flee,[e] then they will not care about us;[f] even if half of us die, they will not care about us,[g] but now, you are like ten thousand of us. And so then, it is better for us that you be in the city to help.\u201d ", "4": "The king said to them, \u201cI will do what seems good in your eyes.\u201d So the king stood at the side of the gate while all of the troops went out by hundreds and by thousands.

", "7": "The army of Israel was defeated there before the servants of David, and the defeat there was great on that day: twenty thousand. ", "8": "The battle there was spreading over the surface of all the land, and the forest devoured more among the army than[h] the sword did on that day. ", "9": "Absalom was found in the presence of the servants of David as he was riding on the mule. The mule went under the thicket of the great oak tree, and his head was caught in the tree. He was left hanging between heaven and earth, and the mule which was under him went on. ", "10": "When a certain man saw it, he told Joab, and he said, \u201cLook, I saw Absalom hanging in the oak tree!\u201d ", "11": "Then Joab said to the man who was telling him, \u201cLook, if you saw, why did you not strike him down to the ground there? I would have gladly given you[i] ten pieces of silver and a leather belt.\u201d ", "12": "The man said to Joab, \u201cEven if I felt the weight[j] of a thousand pieces of silver in my palms, I would not have sent my hand against the son of the king, for in our ears the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Whoever you may be, protect the young man Absalom.' ", "13": "If I had dealt treacherously against his life, and there is not any matter hidden from the king, you would have presented yourself aloof.\u201d[k] ", "14": "Joab said, \u201cNo longer will I wait in your presence.\u201d Then he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree.

", "17": "They took Absalom and they threw him into the large pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones over him. Then all of Israel fled, each to his tent.", "18": "(Now Absalom had taken and set up for himself in his lifetime a stone pillar that is in the valley of the king, because he said, \u201cI have no son in order to remember my name,\u201d and he called the stone pillar by his name. It is called the monument of Absalom until this day). ", "19": "Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, \u201cPlease let me run and bring the good news to the king that Yahweh has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies.\u201d ", "20": "Joab said to him, \u201cYou will not be a man bringing[l] good news this day! You may bring good news on another day, but today you will not be bringing good news because the king's son is dead.\u201d ", "21": "Then Joab said to the Cushite, \u201cGo, tell the king what you have seen\u201d; then the Cushite bowed down to Joab and ran off. ", "22": "Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab, \u201cCome what may,[m] please let me also run after the Cushite.\u201d Joab asked, \u201cWhy are you wanting to run, my son, when for you there is no messenger's reward?\u201d[n] ", "23": "\u201cCome what may,[o] I want to run.\u201d He said to him, \u201cRun,\u201d so Ahimaaz ran on the road on the plain, and he passed the Cushite.", "24": "Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and he lifted up his eyes and watched, and look, a man was running by himself.

He said as he went, \u201cMy son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom. If only[s] I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son.\u201d"}

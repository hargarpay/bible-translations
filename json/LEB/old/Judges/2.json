{"1": "And the angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, \u201cI brought you up from Egypt, and I brought you to the land that I had promised to your ancestors.[a] I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you. ", "2": "And as for you, do not make a covenant[b] with the inhabitants of this land; break down their altars.' But you did not listen to my voice. Why would you do such a thing?[c] ", "3": "Now I say, I will not drive them out from before you; they will become as thorns[d] for you, and their gods will be a trap for you.\u201d ", "4": "And as the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the Israelites,[e] the people wept bitterly.[f] ", "5": "And they called the name of this place Bokim,[g] and there they sacrificed to Yahweh.", "6": "And Joshua sent the people away, and the Israelites[h] went each to their[i] own inheritance to take possession of the land. ", "7": "And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who saw all the great work Yahweh had done for Israel.

They followed[q] other gods from the gods of the people who were around them; and they bowed down to them, and they provoked the anger of Yahweh.

{"1": "After a while, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat.[a] He said, \u201cI want to go to my wife's private room.\u201d But her father would not allow him to enter. ", "2": "Her father said, \u201cI really thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead.\u201d[b] ", "3": "And Samson said to them, \u201cThis time, as far as the Philistines are concerned, when I do something evil I am without blame.\u201d ", "4": "And Samson went and captured three hundred foxes, and he took torches. He turned them tail to tail, and he put one torch between two tails. ", "5": "He set fire to the torches and let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and he burned both the stacks[c] of sheaves and the standing grain, up to the vineyards[d] of olive groves. ", "6": "And the Philistines said, \u201cWho has done this?\u201d And they said, \u201cSamson the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion.\u201d And the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.

What is this that you have done to us?\u201d And he said to them, \u201cJust as they did to me, so I have done to them.\u201d ", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWe have come down to bind you and give you over into the hand of the Philistines.\u201d And Samson said to them, \u201cSwear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.\u201d ", "13": "They said to him, \u201cNo, we will only bind you and give you into their hand; we will certainly not kill you.\u201d So they bound him with two new ropes, and they brought him up from the rock.", "14": "As he came up to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has burned with fire, and his bindings melted from his hands.

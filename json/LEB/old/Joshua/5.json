[d]", "2": "At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, \u201cMake for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the Israelites[e] a second time.\u201d ", "3": "So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the Israelites[f] at the hill of the foreskins.[g] ", "4": "This is the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt on the journey.[h] ", "5": "For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey[i] after they left from Egypt were not circumcised. ", "6": "For forty years the Israelites[j] traveled in the wilderness until all the nation, the warriors that left Egypt, perished, because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. To them Yahweh swore that they would not see the land that he[k] swore to their ancestors[l] to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. ", "7": "And it was their children whom he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the journey.[m]", "8": "And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered. ", "9": "And Yahweh said to Joshua, \u201cToday I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.\u201d Therefore, the name of that place is called Gilgal[n] to this day.

And Joshua went to him and said, \u201cAre you with us, or with our adversaries?\u201d ", "14": "And he said, \u201cNeither. I have come now as the commander of Yahweh's army.\u201d And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and he bowed down[t] and said to him, \u201cWhat is my lord commanding his servant?\u201d ", "15": "The commander of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, \u201cTake off your sandals[u] from your feet,[v] for the place where you are standing is holy.\u201d And Joshua did so."}

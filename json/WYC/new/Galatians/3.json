{"1": "O! unwitty Galatians, before whose eyes Jesus Christ is exiled, and is crucified in you, who hath deceived you, that ye obey not to truth?[a] ", "2": "This only I desire to learn of you, whether ye have received the Spirit of the works of the law, or of hearing of belief?[b] ", "3": "So ye be fools, that when ye have begun in Spirit, ye be ended in flesh [now ye be ended by flesh]. ", "4": "So great things ye have suffered without cause [Ye have suffered so many things without cause], if it be without cause. ", "5": "[Therefore] He that giveth to you [the] Spirit, and worketh works of power in you, whether of [the] works of the law, or of hearing of belief [or of hearing of faith]? ", "6": "As it is written, Abraham believed to God, and it was reckoned to him to rightwiseness. ", "7": "And therefore know ye, that these that be of belief, be the sons of Abraham.[c] ", "8": "And the scripture seeing afar, that God justifieth the heathen of belief, told before to Abraham, That in thee all the heathen shall be blessed [for God justifieth of faith heathen men, told before to Abraham, For in thee all folks, or heathen men, shall be blessed]. ", "9": "And therefore these that be of belief [Therefore they that be of faith], shall be blessed with faithful Abraham. ", "10": "For all that be of the works of the law, be under curse; for it is written, Each man is cursed, that abideth not in all things that be written in the book of the law, to do those things.[d] ", "11": "And that no man is justified in the law before God, it is open, for a rightful man liveth of belief. [Forsooth for no man is justified in the law with God, it is known, for a rightful man liveth by faith.] ", "12": "But the law is not of belief, but he that doeth those things of the law [but he that doeth those things], shall live in them. ", "13": "But Christ again-bought us from the curse of the law, and was made accursed for us; for it is written, Each man is cursed that hangeth in the tree;[e] ", "14": "that among the heathen the blessing of Abraham were made in Jesus Christ, that we receive the promise of Spirit through belief. [that the blessing of Abraham in heathen men should be made in Christ Jesus, that we take the promise of Spirit by faith.] ", "15": "Brethren, I say after man, no man despiseth the testament of a man that is confirmed, or ordaineth above [or above-ordaineth other thing]. ", "16": "The promises were said to Abraham and to his seed; he saith not, In [the] seeds, as in many, but as in one, And to thy seed, that is, Christ. ", "17": "But I say, this testament is confirmed of God; the law that was made after four hundred and thirty years, maketh not the testament vain to void away the promise.[f] ", "18": "For if [the] heritage were of the law, it were not now of promise. But God granted to Abraham through promise [Forsooth God gave to Abraham by again-promise].", "19": "What then the law [What therefore profiteth the law]? It was set for trespassing, till the seed came, to whom he had made the promise. Which law was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator. ", "20": "But a mediator is not of one. But God is one.

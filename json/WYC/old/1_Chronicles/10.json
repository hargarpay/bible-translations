(And the Philistines fought against the men of Israel, and the Israelites fled from the Philistines, and fell down dead on Mount Gilboa.)", "2": "And when the Philistines had nighed pursuing Saul and his sons, they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.", "3": "And the battle was aggrieved against Saul; and men archers found him, and wounded him with darts. (And the battle was grievous against Saul; and the archers found him, and mortally wounded him with arrows.)", "4": "And Saul said to his squire, Draw out thy sword, and slay me, lest these uncircumcised men come, and scorn me. But his squire was afeared by dread, and would not do this; therefore Saul took a sword, and felled upon it.", "5": "And when his squire had seen this, that is, that Saul was dead, he felled also on his sword, and was dead.", "6": "Therefore Saul perished (And so Saul died), and his three sons, and all his house felled down together.", "7": "And when the men of Israel, that dwelled in field places, had seen this, they fled; and when Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and were scattered hither and thither; and Philistines came, and dwelled in those. (And when the men of Israel, who lived in the valley, had seen this, they fled; yea, when they heard that Saul and his sons were dead, they deserted their cities, and were scattered here and there; and the Philistines came, and lived in them/and lived there.)", "8": "Therefore in the tother day, the Philistines drew away the spoils of [the] slain men, and found Saul and his sons lying in the hill of Gilboa. (And so the next day, as the Philistines took away the spoils of the slain men, they found Saul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.)", "9": "And when they had spoiled him, and had girded off the head, and had made him naked of the armours, they sent his head into their land, that it should be borne about, and should be showed in the temples of idols, and to (the) peoples;", "10": "and they hallowed his armours in the temple of their god(s), and they setted the head in the temple of Dagon.", "11": "When men of Jabesh of Gilead had heard this, that is, all things which the Philistines did on Saul, (And when some men of Jabesh of Gilead had heard about this, that is, all the things that the Philistines had done to Saul,)", "12": "all [the] strong men rose (up) together, and took the dead bodies of Saul and of his sons, and brought those into Jabesh; and they buried the bones of them under an oak, that was in Jabesh; and fasted seven days.", "13": "Therefore Saul was dead for his wickednesses, for he brake the behest of the Lord, which he [had] commanded, and kept not it, but furthermore also he took counsel at a woman having a fiend speaking in the womb, (And so Saul died for his wickedness, for he broke the word of the Lord/for he broke the command of the Lord, which the Lord had commanded, and he did not obey, but he also took counsel with a woman having a spirit speaking in her womb,)", "14": "and he hoped not in the Lord; for which thing both the Lord killed him, and translated his realm to David, the son of Jesse. (and he asked not of the Lord; for which thing the Lord killed him, and turned his kingdom over to Jesse's son David.)"}

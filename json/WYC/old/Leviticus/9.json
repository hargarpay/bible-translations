{"1": "Forsooth when the eighth day was made, Moses called Aaron, and his sons, and the greater men in birth of Israel (and the men of great age in Israel, that is, the elders);", "2": "and he said to Aaron, Take thou of the drove a calf for sin, and a ram for burnt sacrifice, ever either without wem, and offer thou them before the Lord. (and he said to Aaron, Take thou a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt sacrifice, both without blemish, and offer thou them before the Lord.)", "3": "And thou shalt speak to the sons of Israel, Take ye a buck of goats for sin, and a calf, and a lamb, (both) of one year, and without wem, into burnt sacrifice, (And thou shalt say to the Israelites, Take ye a goat buck for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of one year, and without blemish, for a burnt sacrifice,)", "4": "(and) an ox and a ram for peaceable things; and offer ye them before the Lord, and offer ye [tried] wheat flour sprinkled with oil in the sacrifice of each of them; for today the Lord shall appear to you. (and an ox and a ram for peace offerings; and offer ye them before the Lord, and offer ye fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil along with each offering; for today the Lord shall appear to you.)", "5": "Therefore they took all things, which Moses commanded, to the door of the tabernacle, where, when all the multitude stood, (And so they took all these things, which Moses commanded, to the entrance of the Tabernacle, where, when all the multitude stood,)", "6": "Moses said, This is the word which the Lord commanded (This is what the Lord commanded), do ye it, and his glory shall appear to you.", "7": "And Moses said to Aaron, Nigh thou to the altar, and offer thou for thy sin; offer thou burnt sacrifice, and pray for thee, and for the people; and when thou hast slain the sacrifice of the people, pray thou for them, as the Lord commanded. (And Moses said to Aaron, Approach thou to the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt sacrifice, and pray for thyself, and for the people; and when thou hast killed the offering for the people, pray thou for them, as the Lord commanded.)", "8": "And anon Aaron nighed to the altar, and offered a calf for his sin; (And at once Aaron approached the altar, and offered a calf for his own sin offering;)", "9": "whose blood his sons offered, or brought, to him, in which blood Aaron dipped his finger, and he touched the horns of the altar, and he poured the blood that was left at the foundament of the altar (and he poured out the blood that was left at the foundation, or at the base, of the altar);", "10": "and he burnt upon the altar the inner fatness, and the little reins, and the caul of the maw, (for the sin offering,) as the Lord commanded to Moses.", "11": "Forsooth Aaron burnt with fire without the tents the flesh and the skin thereof. (But Aaron burned its flesh and its skin away from the tents.)", "12": "And he offered the beast of burnt sacrifice, and his sons brought to him the blood thereof, which he shedded by compass of the altar; (And then he offered the beast for the burnt sacrifice, and his sons brought him its blood, which he threw against all the sides of the altar;)", "13": "they offered also that sacrifice cut into gobbets, with the head, and all the members; and he burnt by fire all these things upon the altar, (and they gave him the offering cut into pieces, with the head, and all its members; and he burned all these things on the altar,)", "14": "when the entrails and the feet were washed before with water. (and when the innards and the feet were washed in water, they were also burned, on top of the burnt sacrifice.)", "15": "And he offered and killed a buck of goats, for the sin of the people (And then he brought forth and offered a goat buck, for the people's sin offering); and when the altar was cleansed, he made (the) burnt sacrifice,", "16": "and he added into the sacrifice flowing offerings, that be offered together; (and he added the grain offering to the sacrifice, that should be offered with it;)", "17": "and he burnt those on the altar, without the ceremonies of [the] burnt sacrifice of the morrowtide. (and he burned a handful of the grain offering on the altar, in addition to the morning burnt sacrifice.)", "18": "He offered also an ox, and a ram, [the] peaceable sacrifices of the people; and his sons offered to him the blood, the which he poured by compass of the altar. (And he offered the ox and the ram, for the peace offerings of the people; and his sons brought him the blood, which he threw against all the sides of the altar.)", "19": "Forsooth they putted on the breasts the inner fatness of the ox, and the tail of the ram, and the little reins with their fatnesses, and the caul of the maw.", "20": "And when the inner fatnesses were burnt upon the altar,", "21": "Aaron separated the breasts, and the right shoulders of them, and raised them (up as a special gift) before the Lord, as Moses commanded.", "22": "And he stretched forth his hands to the people, and blessed it; and so when the sacrifices for sin, and [the] burnt sacrifices, and [the] peaceable sacrifices, were fulfilled, Aaron came down from the place of sacrificing. (And he stretched forth his hands to the people, and blessed them; and when the sin offerings, the burnt sacrifices, and the peace offerings, were finished, Aaron came down from the place for sacrificing.)", "23": "Soothly Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle of witnessing, and went out afterward, and blessed the people; (And Moses and Aaron entered into the Tabernacle of the Witnessing, and when they came out afterward, they blessed the people;)", "24": "and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude. And lo! fire went out from the Lord, and devoured the burnt sacrifice, and the inner fatnesses that were upon the altar; and when the companies had seen this thing, they praised the Lord, and felled on their faces (and when the congregation saw this, they praised the Lord, and fell on their faces)."}

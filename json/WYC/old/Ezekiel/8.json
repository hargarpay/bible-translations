For they filled the land with wickedness, and turned (again) to stir me to wrath; and lo! they apply a branch to their nostrils.", "18": "Therefore and I shall do in strong vengeance; mine eye shall not spare, neither I shall do mercy; and when they shall cry to mine ears with great voice, I shall not hear them.

{"1": "To victory, the psalm of David. Lord, the king shall be glad in thy virtue; and he shall full out have joy greatly on thine health. (To victory, the song of David. Lord, the king shall be glad for thy strength, or thy might; and he shall have great joy in thy victory.)", "2": "Thou hast given to him the desire of his heart; and thou hast not defrauded him of the will of his lips. (Thou hast given him his heart's desire; and thou hast not denied him what he asked for with his lips.)", "3": "For thou hast before come him in the blessings of sweetness; thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stone. (For thou hast come before him with the blessings of goodness; thou hast set upon his head a crown of pure gold.)", "4": "He asked of thee life, and thou gavest it to him; the length of days into the world, and into the world of world. (He asked for life from thee, and thou gavest it to him; yea, length of days forever and ever.)", "5": "His glory is great in thine health; thou shalt put glory, and great fairness, on him. (His glory is great because of thy help/Thy salvation hath brought him great glory; thou shalt put honour, and majesty, upon him.)", "6": "For thou shalt give him into blessing into the world of world; thou shalt make him glad in joy with thy cheer. (For thou shalt make him blessed forever and ever; thou shalt make him glad with joy before thee.)", "7": "For the king hopeth in the Lord; and in the mercy of the highest he shall not be moved. (For the king trusteth in the Lord; and by the love of the Most High, he shall not be moved, or shaken.)", "8": "Thine hand be found to all thine enemies; thy right hand find all them that hate thee. (Thy hand shall find all thy enemies; thy right hand shall find all those who hate thee.)", "9": "Thou shalt put them as a furnace of fire in the time of thy cheer; the Lord shall trouble them in his ire, and fire shall devour them. (Thou shalt put them into a fiery furnace at the time of thy coming; the Lord in his anger shall trouble them, and then fire shall devour them.)", "10": "Thou shalt lose the fruit of them from the earth; and the seed of them from the sons of men. (Thou shalt destroy their descendants from off the earth; yea, their children from among the sons and daughters of men.)", "11": "For they bowed evil against thee; they thought counsels, which they might not stablish. (For they brought in evil against thee; yea, they thought out evil plans, but they could not execute them.)", "12": "For thou shalt put them aback; in thy remnants thou shalt make ready the cheer of them. (For thou shalt make them turn, and run away, when thou shalt aim thy arrows at them.)", "13": "Lord, be thou enhanced in thy virtue; we shall sing, and say openly thy virtues. (Lord, be thou exalted in thy strength; we shall sing, and shall talk openly, about thy power.)"}

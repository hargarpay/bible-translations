{"1": "The psalm of Asaph. God stood in the synagogue of gods; forsooth he deemeth gods in the middle. (The song of Asaph. God standeth in the council of heaven; and he judgeth among the gods.)", "2": "How long deem ye (with) wickedness; and take the faces of sinners? (And he saith, How long shall ye judge wickedly; and make exceptions for sinners?)", "3": "Deem ye to the needy man, and to the motherless child; justify ye the meek man and poor. (Judge ye for the needy, and for the motherless; give ye justice to the weak, and to the poor.)", "4": "Ravish ye out a poor man; and deliver ye a needy man from the hand of the sinner. (Rescue ye the poor and the needy; save ye them from the power of sinners.)", "5": "They know not, neither understand, they go in darknesses; all the foundaments of earth shall be moved. (But ye know not, nor do ye understand, that ye go in darkness; and that all the foundations of the earth have been shaken.)", "6": "I said, Ye be gods; and all ye be the sons of the high God. (And I said, Ye be gods; and ye all be the sons of the Most High God.)", "7": "But ye shall die as men; and ye shall fall down as one of the princes. (But ye shall die like men die; and ye shall fall like any of the princes, or the leaders.)", "8": "Rise, thou God, deem thou the earth; for thou shalt have heritage in all folks. (Rise up, O God, and judge thou the earth; for all the nations shall be thy inheritance.)"}

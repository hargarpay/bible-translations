{"1": "The song of the psalm of David. Mine heart is ready, God, mine heart is ready; I shall sing, and I shall say psalm in my glory. (God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I shall sing, yea, I shall sing a song.)[a]", "2": "My glory, rise thou up, psaltery and harp, rise thou up; I shall rise up early. (My spirit, rise thou up; lute and harp, rise thou up; yea, I shall rise up in the morning.)", "3": "Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee among peoples; and I shall say psalm to thee among nations. (Lord, I shall praise thee/I shall confess thee/I shall give thanks to thee among the peoples; and I shall sing a song to thee among the nations, or among the heathen.)", "4": "For why, God, thy mercy is great on heavens; and thy truth is till to the clouds. (For, O God, thy love reacheth above the heavens; and thy faithfulness up to the clouds.)", "5": "God, be thou enhanced above heavens; and thy glory over all earth. (God, be thou exalted above the heavens; and let thy glory be over all the earth.)", "6": "That thy darlings be delivered, make thou safe with thy right hand, and hear [thou] me; (Save thy dear ones; yea, save thou us with thy right hand, and answer thou me.)[b]", "7": "God spake in his holy (place). I shall make full out joy, and I shall part Shechem; and I shall mete the great valley of tabernacles. (God spoke in his holiness/God spoke from his sanctuary, and he said, I shall rejoice, and I shall divide Shechem; and I shall measure out the Succoth Valley.)", "8": "Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; and Ephraim is the up-taking of mine head. Judah is my king; (Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, and Judah is my sceptre.)", "9": "Moab is the cauldron of mine hope. Into Idumea I shall stretch forth my shoe; aliens be made friends to me. (But Moab is my washbowl. And I shall throw my shoes at Edom; and Philistia shall be made subject to me.)", "10": "Who shall lead me forth into a strong city; who shall lead me forth till into Idumea? (Who shall lead me forth into the fortified city? who shall lead me unto Edom?)", "11": "Whether not thou, God, that hast put us away; and, God, shalt thou not go out in our virtues? (Shalt not thou, God, even though thou hast cast us off, or rejected us? or shalt not thou, God, go out with our hosts, or our armies, any more?)", "12": "Give thou help to us (out) of tribulation; for the help of man is vain. (Lord, give thou us help in the time of trouble; for the help of man is worthless, yea, but an empty hope.)", "13": "We shall make virtue in God; and he shall bring our enemies to nought. (With God's help, we shall do valiantly/we shall have the victory; and he shall bring down our enemies into nothing.)"}

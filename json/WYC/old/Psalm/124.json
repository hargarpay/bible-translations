Let Israel say now, If the Lord was not with us/If the Lord had not been for us,)", "2": "no but for the Lord was in us. When men rose up against us; (yea, if the Lord was not with us/if the Lord had not been for us; then when men rose up against us,)", "3": "in hap they had swallowed us quick. When the strong vengeance of them was wroth against us; (they would have swallowed us up alive. Yea, when their fury raged against us;)", "4": "in hap water had swallowed us up. Our soul passed through a strand; (the water would have swallowed us up. When the stream had gone up over our heads;)", "5": "in hap our soul had passed through a water unsufferable. (when the insufferable waters had gone up over our heads.)", "6": "Blessed be the Lord; that gave not us into taking, [(or) the catching,] of the teeth of them. (Blessed be the Lord; who did not allow us to be caught by their teeth.)", "7": "Our soul, as a sparrow, is delivered; from the snare of hunters. The snare is all-broken; and we be delivered. (We have escaped, like a sparrow, from the hunter's snare. The snare is all-broken; and we be set free.)", "8": "Our help is in the name of the Lord; that made heaven and earth (who made heaven and earth)."}

The wicked man said, My sin, or my trespass, is my concern alone; and so the fear of God is not in his heart/and so reverence for God is not in his heart.)", "2": "For he did guilefully in the sight of God; that his wickedness be found to (be) hatred. (But he did deceitfully before God; until his wickedness was found to be hateful.)", "3": "The words of his mouth be wickedness and guile; he would not understand to do well. (The words of his mouth be wicked and deceitful; he desireth not to understand, or to do good.)", "4": "He thought wickedness in his bed; he stood nigh (to) all way(s) (that be) not good; forsooth he hated not malice.", "5": "Lord, thy mercy is in heaven; and thy truth is unto [the] clouds.

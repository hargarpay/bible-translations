(Lord, why hast thou gone so far away? despisest thou us in our time of trouble?)", "2": "While the wicked man waxeth proud, the poor man is burnt; they be taken in the wicked counsels, which they thinked. (While the wicked grow proud, the poor be persecuted; let the wicked be caught in the wicked plans, which they themselves have thought out.)", "3": "For why the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul; and the wicked is blessed. The sinner hath stirred the Lord to wrath; (For the sinner glorieth in the desires of his own soul; and he blesseth the wicked, who have stirred the Lord to anger.)", "4": "after the multitude of his wrath, he shall not seek (after God). God is not in his sight; (And because of the multitude of his pride, he shall not seek after God. Indeed God is not in any of his thoughts;)", "5": "his ways be defouled in all time. Thy dooms be taken away from his face; he shall be lord of all his enemies. (his ways be defiled forever.

His eyes behold cruelly on the poor man; (He sitteth in ambush in villages; to secretly kill the innocent. His eyes look cruelly upon the poor;)", "9": "he setteth ambushes in hid place, as a lion in his den. He setteth ambushes, for to ravish a poor man; for to ravish a poor man, while he draweth (in) the poor man. In his snare he shall make meek the poor man; (he setteth ambush from a hidden place, like a lion in his den. He setteth ambush to catch a poor man; yea, to catch a poor man, when he draweth him into his trap. And with his snare, he shall bring down that poor man;)", "10": "he shall bow himself down, and he shall fall, when he hath been lord of poor men. (yea, that good man shall fall down, and so the poor shall be brought down by his brute strength.)", "11": "For he said in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hath turned away his face, that he see not into the end. (For he said in his heart, God hath forgotten them; he hath turned away his face, and he shall never see this.)", "12": "Lord God, rise thou up, and thine hand be enhanced; forget thou not poor men. (Lord God, rise thou up, and let thy hand be lifted up; do not thou forget the poor.)", "13": "For what thing stirred the wicked man God to wrath? for he said in his heart, God shall not seek.

(The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor; yea, thy ears have heard the desires of their hearts.)", "18": "To deem for the motherless and meek; that a man presume no more to make himself great on earth. (And thou shalt judge in favour of the motherless, and the fatherless, and the humble; so that no longer shall anyone presume to make themselves great upon the earth.)"}

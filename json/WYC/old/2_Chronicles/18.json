And Jehoshaphat said to him, King, speak thou not in this manner. (And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is one man, of whom we can ask the will of the Lord, but I hate him, for every time he prophesieth not good, but only evil for me; this is Micaiah, the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said to him, O king, do not thou say such things.)", "8": "Then the king of Israel called one of his geldings, or (his honest and) chaste servants, and said to him, Call thou anon Micaiah, the son of Imla.

And the Lord said, Thou shalt deceive him, and thou shalt have the mastery; go thou out, and do so.", "22": "Now therefore, lo! the Lord hath given a spirit of leasing in the mouth of all thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil things of thee, that is, he hath said (of the) evil things to come to thee. (And so now, lo! the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil things for thee, that is, he hath said that evil things shall come to thee.)", "23": "And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, nighed, and he smote Micaiah upon the cheek (and he struck Micaiah upon his cheek), and said, By what way hath the Spirit of the Lord passed from me to speak with thee?", "24": "And Micaiah said, Thou thyself shalt see in that day, when thou shalt enter from closet into closet, that thou be hid.

And he said, All peoples hear ye. (And Micaiah said, If thou returnest home safely, the Lord did not speak through me. And he said, Hear ye, all the people.)", "28": "Then the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up into Ramoth of Gilead.", "29": "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I shall change my clothing, and so I shall go to fight; but be thou clothed in thy (king's) clothes. Therefore when the king of Israel had changed (his) clothing, he came to (the) battle.", "30": "And the king of Syria commanded to the dukes of the multitude of his knights, and said, Fight ye not against the least, nor against the most; but against the king alone of Israel.

{"1": "I, Nehemiah, am the son of Hacaliah. These are my words. They tell my story. During the winter month of Chislev in the 20th year of Artaxerxes I's reign, I was in the fortress of Susa ", "2": "when one of my brothers, Hanani, came from Judah along with some other men. I asked them about those Jews who had escaped\u2014who had survived the exile\u2014and about our city, Jerusalem.", "3": "Hanani and the Judean Men (to Nehemiah): 3\u00a0It's a disaster. The survivors of the exile who are in the Persian province of Jerusalem have been wronged and are hated. The wall of Jerusalem has been reduced to piles of rock, and its gates consumed by flame.", "4": "Hearing this, I was overwhelmed with grief and could only sit and weep. For days I mourned this news and sought the audience of the True God of heaven, praying and fasting before Him.", "5": "Nehemiah: 5\u00a0Notice me\u2014Eternal One, God of heaven, great and awesome God. You are the keeper of the covenant and loyally love those who love You and follow Your commands.

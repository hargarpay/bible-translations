On the first day of the first month, construction of the congregation tent is completed and dedication of the altar and the priests begins. On the eighth day, the dedication and ordination of the priests is completed. On the twelfth day, the dedication of the altar is completed, the Levites are appointed, and normal services begin.

On the fourteenth day, a second Passover is celebrated for those who were impure from the first celebration. Finally, on the twentieth day, all the Israelites begin their travels to Canaan. Eternal One (to Moses): 2\u00a0To more easily get the people's attention and to summon the people and notify the people that they should break camp, make yourself two trumpets out of fine, hammered silver.

", "5-6": "You can also use them to sound an alarm. Make the alarm sound when it's time to move on. When you need to break camp, one alarm will indicate that the people on the east side should depart; the second will be the sign for those on the south side of camp to depart. ", "7": "But when you only want to gather the people together (not to break camp), simply blow the normal sound.", "8": "There are several patterns of trumpet sounds for various purposes; they are distinguished by the length of the blast and the amount of separation between sounds. Aaron's people, the priests, shall blow them; this is a decree of peace for all generations to come.

Your God, the Eternal, will remember you, and you will be saved from such enemies. ", "10": "Also use the trumpets in happy times. Blow them when you celebrate festivals and make sacrifices. On days of joy, feasting and new moons, sound the trumpets as you offer your burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace offerings. Again, they will be a reminder to your God. I am the Eternal One, your True God.", "11": "When the cloud finally rose up (on the twentieth day of the second month of the second year) from over the congregation tent that housed the terms of the covenant, ", "12": "the Israelites set out from the Sinai Wilderness until the cloud indicated they should stop in the Paran Wilderness.

I'm going to head back home, to my own place and to my kin.", "31": "Moses: 31\u00a0Please don't leave us. You know where it's best to camp out here in the wilderness, and we could certainly benefit from your watching out for us. ", "32": "It'll work out well for you! The Eternal has promised good things for us, and we'll be sure that you have a share in them too.", "33": "So off they went, and they traveled for three days after leaving the Eternal's mountain, known as Sinai or Horeb.

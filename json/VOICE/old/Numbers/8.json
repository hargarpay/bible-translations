Then they'll be appropriately pure. ", "8": "After that, tell them to select a bull-calf along with the prime flour-oil combination (the grain offering). You, too, select another bull-calf for use as a sin offering. ", "9": "Get the Levites to the congregation tent, and have them stand in front of it. Gather all the other Israelites, too, ", "10": "so that when you present the Levites before Me, the Israelites can lay hands on them to indicate that they are the substitutes for all Israel's firstborn.

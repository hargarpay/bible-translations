{"1": "At this, everybody with one voice cried out, and the people groaned and wept all night.", "2": "Israelites (blaming Moses and Aaron): 2\u00a0If only we had just died in Egypt or somewhere along the way in this wilderness, ", "3": "rather than the Eternal One leading us out here to have us slaughtered and our women and the youngsters dragged off as plunder, too, as objects for their pleasure. Wouldn't it be good just to go back to Egypt? ", "4": "Let's figure out among ourselves who should head the group and then make our way back to Egypt.", "5": "While all the gathered Israelites watched, Moses and Aaron collapsed to the ground before the people. ", "6": "Joshua (Nun's son, Moses' young assistant\u2014the one who would succeed him) and Caleb (who was Jephunneh's son) lamented the Israelites' response. These two, who were among those who journeyed into the promised land to explore it and bring back a report, tore their clothes ", "7": "and addressed the whole community of Israelites.

If we all do what is right in the eyes of God, the Eternal will bring us into the land and make it ours. ", "9": "Do not rebel like this against the Eternal. Don't be afraid of the land's inhabitants. It is we who will devour them! They are now defenseless, and nothing can protect them from the Eternal, who is with us. You don't need to be afraid of them!", "10": "But the rest of the Israelites were not convinced. Enraged, the crowd moved to stone Joshua and Caleb. Suddenly, the glory of the Eternal swept into the congregation tent in front of them all.", "11": "What a sad time it is for the Israelites! Joshua and Caleb have pleaded for courage among the people, and Moses and Aaron must now plead for patience on the part of the Lord. The Israelites stand on the edge of God's promise, and they can't find the courage to believe and to move forward by faith into the promise. Because of their reluctance to believe, they must wander through this wilderness with only God to supply their basic needs until He has purged the nation of those who lack faith. The next 38 years will cleanse the nation and develop the character each person needs to claim the promises of God. This same two-step process is repeated throughout the Bible: refine and cleanse while building the necessary faith. Unfortunately, the fire necessary for refinement is normally painful. Eternal One (to Moses): 11\u00a0How many times will this ungrateful people turn their backs to Me? How long will they persist in their faithlessness, refusing to recognize all the wondrous signs I performed in their midst?

However, I will accept you and make you into a fearsome nation, far greater and more impressive than they might be or could ever dream of being.", "13": "Moses: 13\u00a0If You kill them, the Egyptians (whom You forced Your people away from) will get wind of it, ", "14": "and they'll tell the people of this new world, because all have already heard that You, O Eternal One, are present among Your people here, that You've been seen face-to-face, and that You personally guide them by a cloud-column during the day and a fire-column at night.

Although they witnessed My glory and signs firsthand, and the amazing feats I accomplished on their behalf in Egypt and on this desert sojourn, they tested Me over and over again, even 10 times, and even directly disobeyed. None of the people who have turned their backs on Me will ever see the land. ", "24": "For Caleb, though, it's a different matter. He's distinct from the others by having a different spirit and has followed My lead wholeheartedly. I will make sure that he is able to enter the land and to live in it\u2014he and his descendants after him.", "25": "Now, to avoid the Amalekites and Canaanites who presently inhabit the valleys, turn around tomorrow, and make for the desert by way of the Red Sea.[a]", "26": "The Eternal One reiterated to Moses and Aaron,", "27": "Eternal One: 27\u00a0How many times will these bad people grumble against Me and My choices?

You'll die out here in the desert. ", "33": "Until then, your children will have to wait it out, keeping the herds and flocks out here in the wilderness. On account of your faithlessness, they'll have to wait the 40 years it'll take for you all to die.

I, the Eternal One, have spoken, and so I will do it. This especially wicked group that banded together against Me will suffer for it, each and every one, and will come to an end and die out here in this wilderness.", "36-37": "Remember that the men who had been hand-selected by Moses to scout out the promised land delivered a less-than-positive report. Consequently, in the assenting presence of the Eternal, they were all killed by a plague.

Despite our wrongdoings, let's go up into the land the Eternal promised us on our own.", "41": "Moses: 41\u00a0Why do you keep doing what you're not supposed to do? You will not succeed in your efforts. ", "42-43": "He will not accompany you, so you're vulnerable on all sides. Because you've rejected the Eternal, you won't have Him in your midst and on your side. When you run into the Amalekites and Canaanites, they will slay you on the spot.", "44": "Despite Moses' protestations, the people tried. The chest of the Eternal's covenant and Moses himself remained back in the camp. ", "45": "Sure enough, the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived there descended upon them, attacked them, and chased them clear back to Hormah, which means the place of complete destruction."}

Some 24,000 Israelites died in that judgment. Moses is now told to pick up where the priest Phinehas left off and kill the Midianites. Moses (to the Israelites): 3-5\u00a0Get yourselves ready for war. From among your men, select 1,000 from each of Israel's tribes. Arm them, and send them out to fulfill God's desire to make the Midianites pay for their treachery. So it was that 12,000 Israelite men went off to war.

", "8": "They killed all five of Midian's kings (Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba), and they even executed Balaam (Beor's son) too.", "9-11": "This is a surprising note about Balaam. He honored the Lord and would only speak blessing over Israel (22\u201324). Here and later (Joshua 13:22; 24:9\u201310), Balaam is cast as an enemy of God's people (also 2 Peter 2:15; Revelation 2:14). They captured Midian's women and children and everything of value\u2014livestock, luxury items, whatever seemed good\u2014to bring back with them, and they burned what was left of the cities and camps.

This applies to you and your prisoners.", "21": "Because of the details concerning priestly matters of ritual process and purity, Eleazar the priest explains how the Lord commanded they should proceed. They have been in contact with corpses, blood, and pagan objects, and it is essential that they cleanse themselves properly as members of this holy congregation.

After that, you shall be considered pure and may return to the camp.", "25": "The Eternal One told Moses how to divide the spoils.", "26": "Eternal One: 26\u00a0Get Priest Eleazar and the heads of the extended families of the group to help you inventory everything the soldiers brought back with them from Midian, prisoners and possessions.

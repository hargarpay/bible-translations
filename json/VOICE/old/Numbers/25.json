They got friendly and had sexual relations. ", "2": "The Moabites invited these Israelites to participate in Moabite religious rituals and worship of their gods, ", "3": "and God's people bound themselves to the deity Baal of Peor, which made the Eternal One furious at Israel.", "4": "Eternal One (to Moses): 4\u00a0Grab them! Every wicked leader of this people. Then in broad daylight, in front of the Eternal, string them up on stakes to twist and turn so that My burning rage doesn't consume the entire population.", "5": "Moses (to the Israelite judges): 5\u00a0Look to your people, and kill whoever pledged himself to the deity Baal of Peor.", "6": "Just then, even as people were dying right and left, one Israelite returned from among the Midianites with a woman whom he planned to make a part of his family. With her in tow, he walked right past Moses and everybody else while they were mourning in front of the congregation tent. ", "7": "When Priest Aaron's grandson Phinehas (Eleazar's son) saw them, he took a spear in his hand. ", "8": "He charged into the Israelite's tent and ran the spear straight through the bellies of the couple.

It is for their protection and well-being that God aggressively punishes those who pollute the faith. Eternal One: 11\u00a0Phinehas (Eleazar's son and Priest Aaron's grandson) has done well. He saved the Israelites. Because he was so zealous on My account, tolerating no compromise, I did not consume the people of Israel with My jealousy.

She was a Midianite leader's daughter."}

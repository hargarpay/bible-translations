{"1": "The people of the Lord have been out of Egypt for more than a year; and God has provided direction, instruction, and correction from inside columns of smoke, from on top of mountains, from anywhere His people were located. But now they have the special congregation tent\u2014a complex, multilayered tent within an enclosed court, which they can take along on their journeys and set up anywhere. This is a holy place for the people of the Lord. It is the place for them to offer sacrifices; and inside this special tent, behind a heavy curtain, is the holiest place of all, where their spiritual leaders receive revelation from God. There are two Hebrew words used for this special place. One is literally \u201ctent\u201d while the other is \u201cdwelling.\u201d The word \u201ctent\u201d usually refers to the entire congregation tent, where any Israelite may come to the outer court and sacrifice. The word \u201cdwelling\u201d is used for that extra holy place or sanctuary behind the curtain, the residence of God or the place of His revelation where only certain priests were allowed. Now the people are ready to begin the preparation to move into the land promised to them by the Lord. First, He sets about organizing this enormous band of escaped slaves. Nearly two years after they had left Egypt, the Israelites were still in the wild desert area of Sinai. But on the first day of the second month, the Eternal One spoke to Moses in the tent of congregation.", "2": "Eternal One (to Moses): 2\u00a0Add up exactly how many Israelites there are, but don't merely count them.

Aaron can help you organize them into groups and record them as armies. ", "4": "Your leadership team will include someone from each tribe who is the head of his extended family.

They are the heads of the clans that compose Israel.", "17": "Moses and Aaron gathered these chosen leaders by name; ", "18": "and on the first day of the second month, they brought the whole community together to register by their clans and extended families and to specify individuals who were 20 years old and older.

In Exodus 30, they count the population to develop an orderly funding program for the construction of the congregation tent. Here God tells them to count the men eligible for fighting in their militia; and in chapter 26, after a plague has ravaged the people, they will once again determine the size and makeup of their fighting force. It is interesting to note the change in the number of warriors within each of the extended families. Some tribes experience a tremendous loss in the number of fighters, and other tribes have a considerable increase: The Levites were not included in this registration and organizing of the extended families' tribe members because the Eternal One had expressly told Moses not to count them.", "50": "Eternal One (to Moses): 50\u00a0You will make the Levites responsible for the congregation tent that houses the terms of the covenant, its furnishings, and accoutrements.

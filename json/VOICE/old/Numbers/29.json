And follow the same procedure for the grain offering, using about six quarts of fine flour mixed with oil for the bull, about four quarts for the ram, and about two quarts for each lamb. ", "6": "This shouldn't take the place of either the daily or the regular monthly offering of meat, grain, and wine. Rather, it is in addition to the regular one.

Celebrate it soberly, don't do any work, ", "8-11": "but make an offering just like the one on the first day (one male calf, a ram, and seven male lambs, all perfect yearlings\u2014including the goat as a sin offering). Also follow the same procedure for the grain offering using about six quarts of fine flour mixed with oil for the bull, about four quarts for the ram, and about two quarts for each lamb. This will cover all the evil you did in the last year with the burnt offering, grain offering, and drink offering.", "12": "Mid-month, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, you shall observe another ritual marking that day's holiness, and you won't work.

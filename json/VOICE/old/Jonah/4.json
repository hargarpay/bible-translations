{"1": "The mercy God extended toward Nineveh upset Jonah terribly. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. ", "2": "So he prayed to the Eternal. Jonah has time to think of how greatly the Assyrians are oppressing Israel, and he can't reconcile their deliverance. Jonah: Eternal One, isn't this what I said would happen when I was still in my own country? This is exactly the reason I ran away to Tarshish in the first place. I know how You are! I know that You are not like other gods, that You are full of grace and compassion, that it takes a lot to make You angry, and that Your loyal love is so great that You are always ready to relent from inflicting misery. ", "3": "Eternal One, since You didn't kill them, please take my life away from me. For my death now is so much better than my life tomorrow.", "4": "Eternal One: 4\u00a0Jonah, do you have any good reason to be angry?", "5": "Jonah headed east out of the city instead of west toward his home to look for a place high above the city to sit down.

Jonah: My death now is so much better than my life tomorrow.", "9": "Eternal One: 9\u00a0Do you have any good reason to be angry about this gourd's vine? Jonah: Yes, I do. I'm angry enough to die.", "10": "Eternal One: 10\u00a0Jonah, don't you understand? You care about this gourd's vine, and yet you didn't do anything to make it grow; you didn't plant it, water it, or protect it. It appeared one night then died another. ", "11": "Should I not have pity on that great city of Nineveh where there are more than 120,000 people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?"}

David: Are you Ziba? Ziba: At your service, Majesty.", "3": "David: 3\u00a0Is anyone from Saul's family still alive to whom I could show the kindness of God? Ziba: Jonathan has a son who is still alive; he is crippled, unable to use his feet.", "4": "David: 4\u00a0Where is he? Ziba: He lives with Machir, son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.", "5-6": "David still remembers his deepest friendship. The loss of Jonathan haunts David, and he desires to show honor to the family of God's anointed, Saul. David promised his friend Jonathan that if he ever became king, he would treat Jonathan and his descendants with kindness. Their friendship was important to David; and although he thinks all of Saul's family has been destroyed, he wants to find out if somewhere there might be a relative of Jonathan whom he may honor in gratitude for all Jonathan did for him. David sent for Jonathan's son Mephibosheth and had him brought to Jerusalem from the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. When he arrived, Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, grandson of Saul, laid facedown on the floor and honored the king. David: Mephibosheth! Mephibosheth: At your service, my king.", "7": "David: 7\u00a0There's no need to be frightened. I intend to treat you kindly for the sake of your father, Jonathan, who was my loyal friend. I will return to you all the territory that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always be welcome at my table.", "8": "Mephibosheth again prostrated himself before the king. Mephibosheth: What am I to you that the king should look with favor on a dead dog like me? I am as one of your servants.", "9": "Then the king summoned Ziba, who had been Saul's servant. David: Everything that belonged to his grandfather Saul and his family I have returned to your master's descendant. ", "10": "You, your sons, and your servants will work on his farms and bring in his produce, so that he and his household will have food. But Mephibosheth will always eat at my table. Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants.", "11": "Ziba: 11\u00a0I am your servant, and you are my lord and king. Whatever you command I will do. From then on, Mephibosheth ate at the king's table as though he were one of David's own sons. ", "12": "Mephibosheth had a young son, Mica; and all who lived in the house of Ziba became Mephibosheth's servants and worked for him. ", "13": "Mephibosheth remained in Jerusalem, where he always ate at the king's table. He was lame and could not walk on either foot."}

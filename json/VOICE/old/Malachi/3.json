Notice has been given: be ready. Can anyone live through the day when He arrives? Will anyone be left standing when He appears? He is a purifying fire; He is like lye soap.", "3": "Like a refiner of silver, He will purify the descendants of Levi\u2014 Until they are pure, unalloyed gold and silver. Then they will draw near to the Eternal One, Presenting offerings with righteous, clean hands.", "4": "Then the Eternal One will unequivocally accept the sweet offering of Judah and Jerusalem as He did in the days of old, as in the former years when the covenant was new.", "5": "Eternal One: 5\u00a0Then I will approach you for judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the constant sorcerers; the chronic adulterers; the habitual liars; those who continue cheating wages from their hired laborer, a widow, or an orphan; and those who always reject the immigrant, not fearing Me, the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies.

", "9": "You are cursed with a curse, for as an entire nation you are stealing from Me. ", "10": "To rectify this situation, you must bring the entire tithe into the storage house in the temple so that there may be food for Me and for the Levites in My house.

{"1": "Many days passed, and the word of the Eternal visited Elijah during the third year of the drought. Eternal One: Go now, and reveal yourself to Ahab. When you do, I will bring rain on the earth.", "2": "Elijah then went to reveal himself to Ahab. During this time, there was a dangerous shortage of food in Samaria, ", "3": "and Ahab had summoned Obadiah to come to him. Obadiah was the coordinator of Ahab's palace and was wholly devoted to the Eternal. ", "4": "Back when Jezebel was murdering all the prophets of the Eternal, Obadiah had given 100 prophets refuge. There were two caves in which he hid the prophets\u201450 prophets in each cave. He provided them with food and water during this time.", "5": "Ahab (to Obadiah): 5\u00a0Search through the land, and visit all the springs and streams that run through the ravines; see if you can find any grass on which we can allow our horses and mules to graze, so that they may stay alive for as long as possible. Do this so that we don't have to kill our own beasts.", "6": "Ahab and Obadiah split up the regions they were going to explore, and they both traveled in different directions to save time.", "7": "While Obadiah was exploring the land, suddenly Elijah came upon him. Obadiah knew who he was\u2014a prophet\u2014and he fell on his face before Elijah. Obadiah: I can't believe it's really you, master Elijah.", "8": "Elijah: 8\u00a0Yes, it is I. Go now, and give this message to your king: \u201cElijah has arrived.\u201d", "9": "Obadiah: 9\u00a0What is the purpose of this? Have I wronged you or God? Why do you put your servant in a dangerous spot with Ahab? Ahab will most certainly kill me. ", "10": "As surely as your True God, the Eternal lives, there is not a single country or kingdom that Ahab has not searched for you. Whenever a country said that you were not there, Ahab made them swear an oath that you were nowhere to be found. ", "11": "Now you are asking me to give him your message: \u201cLook, Elijah has arrived.\u201d ", "12": "I don't know where the Spirit of the Eternal is going to lead you after I depart from you. In fact, I am certain if I tell Ahab that you have arrived, He will take you somewhere else; and if you are nowhere to be found, then I will be put to death. Since I, your servant, was young, all of my worship and devotion has gone to the Eternal One. ", "13": "Don't you know, my master, what I did during the time that Jezebel was murdering all the Eternal One's prophets? I gave 100 prophets refuge. I hid them away in 2 caves\u201450 prophets in each cave\u2014and I provided them with food and water. ", "14": "Even after all that I have done for the Eternal One, you ask me to give my king the message, \u201cLook, Elijah has arrived.\u201d He will surely kill me! Elijah: Do not fear for your life. ", "15": "As certain as the life of the Eternal One, Commander of heavenly armies, whom I serve, I will reveal myself to Ahab on this very day. You have nothing to worry about.", "16": "Obadiah approached Ahab and gave him Elijah's message. Ahab immediately went to find Elijah.", "17": "Ahab (seeing Elijah): 17\u00a0There you are. I thought I perceived a troublemaker in Israel.", "18": "Elijah: 18\u00a0Hypocrite! I have caused no mischief in Israel. It is you and your family who are guilty of the very thing you accuse me of. You have turned your back on the laws of the Eternal and abandoned your devotion to Him. Instead you have given yourselves to the Baals, the masters of pagan nations. ", "19": "Now I want you to gather the entire community of Israel and send them to Mount Carmel to meet with me. I have a message for them. Be sure to gather the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the goddess Asherah\u2014the ones who fill their mouths and stomachs with food from Jezebel's table.", "20": "Ahab did as Elijah asked, sent word throughout the entire community of Israel, and gathered all the prophets atop Mount Carmel.", "21": "Elijah (approaching the people): 21\u00a0How much longer will you sit on the fence, refusing to make a decision between the Lord and Baal? If you believe the Eternal One is the True God, then devote yourselves entirely to Him. If you believe Baal is your master, then devote yourselves entirely to him. All the people who were gathered together atop Mount Carmel were completely silent. They didn't know what to say to this.", "22": "Elijah: 22\u00a0I am the last remaining prophet of the Eternal. Baal has 450 prophets. Let us do a test to reveal the true quality of our deities. ", "23": "Bring us two young bulls, the common sacrifice to your master whom you depict as a bull. The prophets of Baal may choose first which bull they want. They will kill it, chop it up, and prepare it for a fire by placing it above wood; but they will not light it. I will do the same with the other bull and prepare it for fire and place it above wood, but I will not light it. ", "24": "Then you call upon your god, Baal, and I will call upon the Eternal. The God who answers with fire is the one True God. Everyone liked this idea and said, \u201cThis sounds like a worthy plan.\u201d", "25": "Elijah (to the prophets of Baal): 25\u00a0You have the pick of the bulls. Take the one you want, and prepare it first because there are many of you. Call upon your god, but do not set fire to the wood.", "26": "The prophets of Baal picked out their bull and prepared it. They called upon Baal from dawn till noon, crying out, \u201cBaal, answer us with fire!\u201d But there was no voice, no reply. Nothing happened. All they did was dance around the altar they had built and cry out to an elusive god.", "27": "At about midday, Elijah began provoking them. Elijah: You have to shout louder than that! The one to whom you cry out certainly must be a god! Perhaps he is daydreaming or napping or away from his heavenly throne. Perhaps he is in a deep sleep, and you must wake him up. Shout louder!", "28": "So all the prophets of Baal began to shout at the top of their lungs pleading with all their might. They cut themselves with knives and swords and spears until they were covered in their own blood. ", "29": "Midday passed by, and the prophets of Baal kept on with their antics until it was time for the evening sacrifice. But still, there was no voice, no reply. No god heard them.", "30": "Elijah (to the people): 30\u00a0Gather around me. So all the people gathered around him, and he fixed the Eternal's altar that had been torn down. ", "31": "Elijah gathered 12 stones, one for each of Jacob's tribes. Jacob was the one who wrestled with God and whom the word of the Eternal One visited, saying, \u201cYour name will be Israel.\u201d", "32": "Elijah took the 12 stones and constructed an altar in honor of the Eternal One and carved a ditch out around it large enough to hold 13 quarts of seed. ", "33": "He set up the wood, chopped up the bull, and placed it on top of the wood. Elijah (to the people): Go get four big jars, and fill them all up with water. Then pour the water out over the burnt offering and the wood. ", "34": "Now, do the same thing again. And so they did it a second time. Elijah: All right, now do the same thing a third time. And so they did it a third time. ", "35": "The water covered the altar and even filled up the ditch. ", "36": "When it was time for offering the evening sacrifice, Elijah called out to the Eternal. Elijah (praying): Eternal One\u2014God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel\u2014reveal Yourself on this day as Israel's God. Make it known that I serve You and have done all this because You commanded it of me. ", "37": "Answer me, Eternal One. Reveal Yourself so that everyone here will know that You, Eternal One, are the True God\u2014the only God. Do it so that everyone knows You are turning the gaze of their hearts back to You again.", "38": "Right then the Eternal One's fire landed upon the altar. The flames consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the ground. The flames even drank up all the water in the ditch. ", "39": "When everyone witnessed this extraordinary power, they all put their faces to the ground in fear and awe and wonder. People: The Eternal One is the True God! The Eternal One is the True God!", "40": "Elijah: 40\u00a0Seize all the prophets of Baal. Don't let a single one of them escape! So everyone grabbed hold of the prophets of Baal, and Elijah gave instruction for them to be taken to the Kishon Valley and killed immediately\u2014no exceptions.", "41": "Elijah (to Ahab): 41\u00a0You should go fill your belly with food and water. I hear a heavy rain coming.", "42": "Ahab did as Elijah instructed and went to eat and drink. Elijah journeyed to the peak of Mount Carmel. There he bowed down on the ground and placed his head between his knees.", "43": "Elijah (to his servant): 43\u00a0Go now, and look in the direction of the sea. Servant (returning to Elijah): I did as you asked, and there is nothing in the direction of the sea. Elijah gave him the same instruction seven times, \u201cGo back, and look in the direction of the sea.\u201d ", "44": "The servant did as Elijah requested each time; and on the seventh time, he told Elijah, \u201cA minuscule cloud, as tiny as the hand of a man, is ascending from the sea.\u201d Elijah: Go quickly, and give a message to Ahab for me: \u201cPrepare your chariot, and leave quickly before the rain gets torrential and keeps you from traveling.\u201d", "45": "The sky became filled with dark monstrous clouds, the wind grew wild, the heavy rain fell, and Ahab traveled quickly in his chariot to Jezreel. ", "46": "The strength of the Eternal filled Elijah. The prophet pulled up his garment around his thighs and sprinted ahead of Ahab the entire way to Jezreel."}

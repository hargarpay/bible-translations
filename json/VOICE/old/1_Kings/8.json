{"1": "The construction of the temple is the most important accomplishment of Solomon's reign. This building both establishes and symbolizes Israel's connection to God. Once the covenant chest is placed there, it is literally the meeting point between them, and the sheer opulence of the temple reveals the priorities of the government. So much of Solomon's wealth is put into this building instead of being used to build an empire, as his neighbors would do, because he trusts God with the fate of Israel. Nothing demonstrates that more clearly than the storage of the nation's weapons in the temple. God is their guardian in every way. To transport the Eternal's covenant chest out of Zion, the city of David, Solomon assembled all the most important people of Israel before him in Jerusalem: the elders and all the heads of the Israelite tribes\u2014the chiefs of the patriarchs' families. ", "2": "Every man in Israel gathered with King Solomon at the great feast during the 7th month (which is called Ethanim), 11 months after the temple was finished.

They set the covenant chest down beneath the wings of the guardian creatures. ", "7": "The creatures' wings were spread above the chest, forming a sort of canopy over the chest and its carrying rods. ", "8": "The carrying rods were long enough that they poked through the curtains and could be seen from the sacred place in front of the inner sanctuary, but a person could not see them from outside. The carrying rods are still there today.", "9": "The only things inside the covenant chest were the two stone tablets Moses placed there in Horeb, where the Eternal One entered into a covenant with the Israelites after they had departed from Egypt.", "10": "When the priests departed from the most holy place, a cloud filled the Eternal's temple. ", "11": "The cloud was so powerful that the priests could not remain standing to serve. His glory filled the temple.", "12": "Solomon: The Eternal dwells in this thick cloud. He said so Himself.", "13": "Surely this means I have built a worthy dwelling place for Him forever.", "14-15": "(then facing the standing assembly of Israelites) Praise be to the Eternal One, Israel's God, who made promises with His mouth to my father, David; and who today has fulfilled His promises with His actions and said, ", "16": "\u201cWhen I led My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not look to the tribes of Israel and appoint a city to build a temple for My name.

I now sit upon my father David's throne\u2014the throne of Israel\u2014just as He said, and I have constructed the temple honoring the reputation of the Eternal One, Israel's God. ", "21": "There I have made a sacred space for the covenant chest. Inside the chest is the covenant of the Eternal which He entered into with our ancestors after He led them out of Egypt.", "22": "Solomon was standing in front of the Eternal's altar before the entire community of Israel, and he lifted his hands up toward heaven.", "23": "Solomon: 23\u00a0O Eternal One, Israel's God, there is no other God who compares to You in heaven or on earth.

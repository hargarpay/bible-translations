{"1": "These are the words of the teacher,[a] the son of David, king in Jerusalem.", "2": "Teacher: Life is fleeting, like a passing mist. It is like trying to catch hold of a breath; All vanishes like a vapor; everything is a great vanity.", "3": "What good does it do anyone to work so hard again and again, sun up to sundown? All his labor to gain but a little?", "4": "One generation comes, another goes; but the earth continues to remain.", "5": "The sun rises and the sun sets, laboring to come up quickly to its place again and again.", "6": "The wind in its travels blows toward the south, then swings back around to the north. Back and forth, returning in its circuit again and again.", "7": "All rivers flow to the sea, but the sea is never full. To the place where the rivers flow, there the water returns to flow once again.", "8": "Words, words, words! So many words! They are wearisome things; and yet people cannot refrain from speaking. No eye has ever surveyed the world and said, \u201cI have seen enough\u201d; no ear has ever listened to creation and said, \u201cI have heard enough.\u201d", "9": "What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun; the future only repeats the past.", "10": "One person may say of some idea, \u201cPay attention to this; it's original!\u201d But that same idea has already been expressed; it's been with us through the ages.", "11": "We do not remember those people and events of long ago, as future generations will not remember what is yet to come.", "12": "I, the teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. ", "13": "I decided to seek out and study the wisdom of the ages, of all that had been done under the heavens. I soon discovered the harsh realities of the work God has given us that keeps us so busy. ", "14": "I have witnessed all that is done under the sun, and indeed, all is fleeting, like trying to embrace the wind. ", "15": "There is an old saying: Something crooked cannot be made straight, and something missing cannot be counted.", "16": "I mused over it all and thought to myself, \u201cI have done great things, and I have gained more wisdom than anyone who reigned over Jerusalem before me. I have contemplated great wisdom and knowledge.\u201d ", "17": "I decided to study wisdom and instead acquainted myself with madness and folly. It, too, seemed like trying to pursue the wind, ", "18": "for as my wisdom increased, so did my vexation. As my knowledge grew, so did my pain."}

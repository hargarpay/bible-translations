The teacher drives this point home by reminding his reader that human lives and earthly accomplishments are fleeting. Nothing tangible is permanent. No work lasts. It all slips away and vanishes into thin air. Compare that to God. Everything God does is substantial. Everything God accomplishes lasts forever. Every word God speaks makes a difference. And so, God places within every person a sense of eternity to know yet not understand Him. This world with all its goodness and beauty is not as good as it gets. There is more, so much more, and we are made for that reality too. But not now, not yet. The creation story in Genesis 2 recognizes the common origin of humanity and the animals. There God forms the first human from the \u201cdirt out of the ground\u201d and breathes into him the breath of life, and the man known as Adam becomes a living being. But within a few short verses, God declares that it is \u201cnot good\u201d for Adam to be alone and seeks a \u201cperfectly suited partner\u201d for the human. So God forms from the \u201cground\u201d every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and He brings them to Adam to see if any of them are a \u201cright and proper partner.\u201d Finally, when no suitable companion has been found, God fashions another creature from Adam's own human flesh. When Adam sees her, he knows he has met a perfect partner. Clearly, both Genesis and Ecclesiastes stress how much humanity shares in common with the animals. While we may be different\u2014as explained in the Genesis story\u2014we are all creatures, made of the same stuff, breathing the same air. And perhaps most to the point, we share a common destiny: death. Teacher: 16\u00a0Again, I looked at everything that goes on under the sun and realized that in place of justice, wickedness prevails. In place of righteousness, wrongdoing succeeds.

As one dies, so does the other, for we have the same breath within us. In the end, we have no advantage over the animals. For as I have said, it's all fleeting. ", "20": "Humans and animals alike go to one place; all are formed from dust, and all return to the dust once more. ", "21": "Who really knows whether the spirits of human beings go up and the spirits of animals go down into the earth?

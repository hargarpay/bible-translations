", "10": "In the wilderness, he commissioned more towers and the digging of cisterns for his many livestock in the lowland and plain. And because he so cared for the land, he employed plowmen in the fertile fields and vinedressers in the hills to make the ground productive.", "11": "Uzziah maintained a standing army ready for battle with numbered divisions and weapon specialties. Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official (supervised by Hananiah, a royal officer) maintained the records of the divisions.

Because of his impressive army, many of the surrounding nations knew about Uzziah and how God helped him win battles.", "16": "But when Uzziah had built his army and he no longer thought he needed God's help in battles, he became prideful and corrupt. He was unfaithful to the Eternal One, his True God, entering the Eternal's temple to burn incense on the altar.", "17": "As the king, not even he has the right to burn incense on the incense altar. Only priests could lawfully do this. Azariah the priest and 80 other brave priests of the Eternal followed the king into the temple to stop him.", "18": "Priests: 18\u00a0Uzziah, you cannot burn incense to the Eternal.

The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, wrote about the rest of Uzziah's actions. ", "23": "When Uzziah died, the people with his family buried him near his ancestors in a field that belonged to them. He was not buried in the same tomb as his ancestors because his skin disease made him unclean. Then his son, Jotham, succeeded him as king."}

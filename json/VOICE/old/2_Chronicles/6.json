", "2": "Now I have built You a grand house where You can reside forever.", "3-4": "(turning to the standing assembly of Israel and blessing them) Blessed is the Eternal God of Israel, who made these promises to my father, David, with His mouth and fulfilled them with His hands:", "5": "Since the day I brought My people from the land of Egypt and traveled in the desert with them, I did not choose one city from among the Israelite tribes in which to build a temple where the people could worship Me, nor did I choose any man to lead My people Israel because I had always been their leader. ", "6": "But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place where My reputation will be honored and David as the leader of My people, Israel.", "7": "Verses 14-42 record is a remarkable prayer by Israel's king. Solomon begins by confessing the Lord's attributes and character. Then he speaks of his humility for being given the honor of building this magnificent house, the Jerusalem temple. Solomon's public prayer before all the people brings to mind the conditional nature of this agreement between the Eternal and the people. The only way the temple can remain in operation and the people in the land is if they obey the Eternal's commands. Solomon realizes that rebellion, pestilence, and foreign invasion will come; but if the people open their eyes and lives to God, then His ears and eyes will be opened to the plight of Israel. The centerpiece of the Eternal's relationship to Israel is the Jerusalem temple, and this is manifest at the moment when Solomon ends his prayer and divine fire comes from the heavens to consume the offerings and sacrifices. Shortly after he became king, my father, our beloved King David, wanted to build a house honoring the reputation of the Eternal God of Israel. ", "8": "But the Eternal did not agree to David's plan. He told my father David, \u201cIt is good that you want to build a house honoring My reputation; ", "9": "however, you will not build the house.

", "13": "Then he stood on the bronze platform he had built in the center of the court (90 inches long, 90 inches wide, and 54 inches high), knelt down, spread out his hands toward heaven, ", "14": "and prayed. Solomon: Eternal God of Israel, You are unparalleled among the gods of heaven and earth. You honor Your covenants with Your servants and give limitless loyal love to those who faithfully follow You. ", "15": "Until now, You have honored Your covenant with my father David, Your servant and our beloved king, by doing all that You promised him. ", "16": "Now that David is no longer king and I have replaced him, remember what You promised to my father David, Your servant: \u201cAs long as your descendants follow My laws as you have done, one of them will always be a king of Israel.\u201d ", "17": "Eternal God of Israel, honor this promise which You made to Your servant David.", "18": "How can I think that this temple I have built will be suitable lodging for You when the heavens You created are not vast enough? Certainly we are not worthy to have You live among us humans.

This will be the place for us to communicate with You. Here Your reputation will be honored, so You will be able to hear the prayers Your servants offer here.

Forgive the sins of Your servants, Your people Israel, teach them how to follow Your ways, and send rain to Your land that You have given as an inheritance to Your people.", "28": "If disasters, plague, or disease strike Israel\u2014famine, pestilence, blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or military attacks at their gates\u2014", "29-30": "then hear from Your house in heaven the prayers of every man (for his own sins) and the prayers of all Israel (for the sins of the nation) offered up with outstretched hands toward Your earthly house.

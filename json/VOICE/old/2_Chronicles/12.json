", "2": "Their unfaithfulness resulted in Shishak, king of Egypt, attacking Jerusalem during King Rehoboam's fifth year. ", "3": "Shishak's army included 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and countless mercenaries from Libya, Suk, and Ethiopia.[a] ", "4": "He conquered the fortified cities in Judah, and as he approached Jerusalem ", "5": "Shemaiah the prophet brought another message from the True God to Rehoboam and Judah's governors (who had fled to Jerusalem at the threat of Shishak's army).

Although God does not allow Shishak to destroy Jerusalem, the Israelites lose a precious part of their heritage and a significant amount of wealth when he raids the palace and temple. This incident is enough to remind Rehoboam and the people of their ancestors' servitude in Egypt and of God's love of His people. If they don't want to return to lives of bondage, they must humble themselves and resume proper worship of God. To replace his father's golden shields, King Rehoboam cast bronze shields and gave them to the commanders who guarded the palace entrance.

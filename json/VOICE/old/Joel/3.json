I will judge them for how they treated My people, My legacy, Israel\u2014 Whom they deported and exiled to the nations. They divided My land among themselves;", "3": "They cast lots for My people, selling them into slavery\u2014 trading boys for prostitutes, selling young girls for a drink of wine.", "4": "Tyre, Sidon, and all the districts of Philistia, what do you have against Me? Are you trying to get back at Me? Do you pay me back? I will turn your wicked actions back upon your heads, fast and sure.", "5": "You have taken wonderful treasures from My house, My silver and gold, and you carried them to your own temples and palaces.", "6": "You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to send them far away from their home without hope of return.", "7": "But now, watch! I am going to awaken them to action, and in those distant lands where you sold them I will turn your wicked actions back upon your heads:", "8": "I will sell your sons and daughters into slavery. Now the people of Judah will be your children's masters. Indeed, they will sell your children to the Sabeans, who will take them far, far away.

For that is where I will come Myself and set forth judgment against the nations who surrounded and attacked My Israel.", "13": "Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe for judgment.

Jerusalem will be My holy city; never again will foreign invaders infiltrate it.", "18": "On that great day, the Eternal will provide: Sweet wine will drip down from the mountains. Fresh milk will pour down from the hills. Clear water will run through Judah's ravines. A fountain will bubble up from the Eternal's temple and water the arid stream bed of Shittim.", "19": "Egypt will become a wasteland and Edom a lonely desert, because they violently attacked the people of Judah And murdered the innocent in Israel.", "20": "But as for Judah, it will always be full of people.

He promised to follow the Eternal, to obey His commands and laws and testaments with all his being. He promised to honor every word of the covenant book that had been discovered in the temple. Everyone who was present entered into the covenant with the king.", "4": "The king gave a command to the high priest, Hilkiah, and to the priests of the second order, as well as the doormen. He told them to remove from the Eternal's house all the vessels that were crafted to honor Baal, Asherah, and all the other gods of the skies. He set them on fire in the fields of Kidron outside of Jerusalem, and then he transported the ashes to Bethel.", "5": "He got rid of the corrupted priests who worshiped false gods and whom the old kings of Judah had instructed to burn incense in the high places in Judah's cities and in the land all around Jerusalem, and those who honored Baal and the sun and moon and stars and all the gods of the skies by burning incense.", "6": "The king removed the sacred pole from the Eternal's temple, and he set it on fire at the Kidron brook just outside Jerusalem. He crushed it until it was nothing more than a pile of dust, and then he tossed the dust onto ordinary graves, further contaminating it by contact with dead bodies.

", "8": "He assembled in Jerusalem all of Judah's priests and destroyed the high places from Geba to Beersheba where they had burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates located on the left side of the city gates near the gate of Joshua, who was governor of Jerusalem.", "9": "The corrupted priests of the high places did not approach the Eternal's altar in Jerusalem, but they filled their bellies with unleavened bread in the company of their families, since they would not travel to Jerusalem to perform their religious duties.", "10": "The king destroyed Topheth as well. Topheth is in the valley of Hinnom's son. He did this so that no man could offer his children as a burnt sacrifice to Molech.", "11": "Close to the entrance to the Eternal's house, near the official Nathan-melech's chamber in the area around the temple, were horses that Judah's kings had dedicated to the sun.

In their place, he desecrated their sites by contact with corpses.", "15": "He tore down the altar at Bethel, the high place\u2014the one erected by Jeroboam (Nebat's son), the very Jeroboam who caused the Israelites to live sinful lives. He crushed the rocks and pounded them into dust and set fire to the sacred pole.", "16": "Josiah turned and observed the graves there on the mountain; and he sent men to gather up the bones and set fire to them on the altar, defiling the altar by contact with corpses exactly as the Eternal One had spoken through the man of God.[a]", "17": "Josiah (noticing a specific burial plot): 17\u00a0What is the significance of that marker? Men of the City: This is a grave marker for the man of God from Judah who prophesied the very things which you have just done to the altar at Bethel.", "18": "Josiah: 18\u00a0Leave him be. No one is to lay a finger on his bones, so that he may rest in peace. They let his bones rest in peace next to the bones of the Samaritan prophet.[b]", "19": "Josiah tore down all the temples of the high places built by Israel's kings in the Samaritan cities. These high places had caused the Eternal's anger to boil. Josiah did the same thing to these houses as he did to the houses in Bethel.", "20": "Josiah also killed all the priests who were present at the high places. He killed them on the altars and set fire to their bones. Then he went back to the place from which he came\u2014Jerusalem.", "21": "Josiah (to the people): 21\u00a0The covenant book that was found in the temple says we must observe the Passover and rejoice in the Eternal One our God, who led us out of bondage in Egypt.", "22": "The Passover had not been observed from the time when the judges judged Israel, even throughout all the generations of Israel's kings and Judah's kings. ", "23": "But during King Josiah's 18th year, the Passover was celebrated in honor of the Eternal One in Jerusalem.", "24": "In addition, Josiah destroyed the clairvoyants, necromancers, household gods, idols, and every other corruption in Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he could make things right according to the laws and commands of the covenant book Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the Eternal's house.", "25": "No king before him or after him ever gave himself to the Eternal so fully and deeply as Josiah did. He offered to the Eternal with all his being: all of his heart, all of his soul, and all his might, in accordance with the sacred law given through Moses.", "26": "Still the Eternal did not abandon His immense wrath.

King Josiah mustered his forces and attempted to block Neco's advance. The situation has changed for Assyria in the 100 years since the Northern Kingdom was conquered. About 7 years after the Babylonians conquer the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, Neco is actually rushing to the aid of Assyria instead of fighting to destroy her. The Egyptian and Assyrian plan is to defeat Babylonia; and unfortunately, Josiah is in the way. The death of the good king Josiah and the victory of Babylonia over both Assyria and Egypt doom Judah to becoming part of the Babylonian Empire. In the ensuing battle, Neco and his forces killed Josiah at Megiddo. ", "30": "Josiah's servants took his body back to Jerusalem from Megiddo in a chariot. They laid him to rest in his own tomb instead of in a tomb with his fathers. The people of Judah then took Josiah's son, Jehoahaz, and anointed him and set him upon the throne of his father as king.", "31": "Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he inherited the throne.

He forced a fee on Judah\u20147,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold. ", "34": "Pharaoh Neco appointed Eliakim (Josiah's son) as king and gave him a new name\u2014Jehoiakim. He transported Jehoahaz to Egypt, where he spent his last days. ", "35": "Jehoiakim handed over all the silver and gold to Pharaoh. It was all tax money he had quickly gathered from the people of the land. He demanded silver and gold from the citizens, according to the tax assessment of each person, and he gave it to Pharaoh Neco.", "36": "Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he was given the throne by Neco. His reign in Jerusalem lasted 11 years. His mother was Zebidah (Pedaiah's daughter from Rumah). ", "37": "He committed evil in the Eternal's eyes. He was just like his ancestors."}

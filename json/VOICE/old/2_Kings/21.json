", "3": "Manasseh reconstructed the high places his father, Hezekiah, had demolished. He constructed altars for Baal and crafted a sacred pole, just as Ahab the former king of Israel had done. He offered his praise to all the gods of the skies and was in service to them.", "4": "He constructed altars in the Eternal's temple to foreign, pagan gods. This was the temple the Eternal had spoken of when He said, \u201cMy name will dwell in Jerusalem.\u201d ", "5": "He contaminated the temple by constructing altars for all the gods of the skies in both the courts in the Eternal's temple.", "6": "He forced his son to go through the fire as a burnt offering, and he was trained in the dark arts of witchcraft and fortune-telling. He practiced them both. He consulted necromancers and clairvoyants. He committed many wicked acts in the Eternal's eyes, which caused Him to boil in anger.", "7": "He placed a carved image of the goddess Asherah in the Eternal's temple. It was the very temple that the Eternal had spoken of to David and to Solomon, saying, \u201cMy name will dwell in this temple in Jerusalem forever. I have handpicked it from all of Israel's tribes.

And this is in addition to causing Judah to live sinful lives and committing evil in the Eternal's eyes.", "17": "According to tradition, one of those innocent people is the prophet Isaiah. Manasseh and Isaiah have a tumultuous relation ship from the start, when Hezekiah invited Isaiah to the court to meet his sons. Isaiah prophesied then that Manasseh would be evil. After Manasseh becomes king, Isaiah tells him the temple will be destroyed. Infuriated, the king orders Isaiah's arrest. Isaiah flees into the hills where he hides inside a cedar tree. But Manasseh's men find him\u2014when they are cutting the tree in half. This legend is attested to by the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews (11:37\u201338).

King of Israel: Tell me everything about Elisha. Fill me in on all the wonders he has done.", "5": "So Gehazi told the king everything. Just when Gehazi got to the part about Elisha bringing the dead boy back to life, the boy's mother walked in and argued that the king should give her back her house and her field. Gehazi's excitement was piqued by the visitor's timing. Gehazi: My lord and king, this is the woman I was just telling you about. And this is her son, the boy whom Elisha brought back to life!", "6": "The king asked the woman if this was true, and she confirmed Gehazi's story. She told the king every detail.

Elisha: Because I am aware of all the wicked things you will do to the Israelites. You will set their strongholds on fire, slaughter their young men with swords, dismember their children, and tear open the bodies of pregnant women.", "13": "Hazael: 13\u00a0But I have no such will or power. Am I, your servant, as low as a dog? Why do you think that I will do such a terrible thing?

", "2": "The city remained under siege until the 11th year of Zedekiah's reign.", "3": "On the 9th day of the 4th month, there was a food shortage in the city, and no one had anything to eat. Everyone became afraid of starvation. ", "4": "The city wall was breached, and all the warriors ran out during the night through the gateway between the two walls near the king's garden, in spite of the Chaldeans surrounding the city. The warriors went on the Arabah road. ", "5": "The Chaldean army chased after the fleeing king and caught up to him in the fields of Jericho. His army dispersed in all directions. ", "6": "They took the king captive and escorted him to Babylon's king at Riblah. Nebuchadnezzar decided on a punishment for the king: ", "7": "they killed Zedekiah's sons right in front of Zedekiah; then they gouged out Zedekiah's eyes so that the slaughter of his sons was the last thing he ever saw, and they put him in bronze shackles and transported him to Babylon.", "8": "On the 7th day, during the 5th month of Nebuchadnezzar's 19th year as king over Babylon, Nebuzaradan, a servant of the king and captain of Nebuchadnezzar's guards, arrived in Jerusalem.

", "11": "Nebuzaradan captured everyone who was still in the city, even the renegades who had fled to Nebuchadnezzar, and he forced them into exile. ", "12": "But Nebuzaradan spared the poorest people and left them to take care of the land as farmers and gardeners.", "13": "The Chaldeans took everything of value. They took the bronze pillars, stands, and the bronze sea in the Eternal's temple; and they broke them up into pieces and took the bronze to Babylon. ", "14": "They also took the pans, the shovels, the snuffers, the bronze objects, and every bronze cup that was used during the rituals of the temple.

", "24": "Gedaliah attempted to assuage them and swore an oath before them. Gedaliah: Do not fear those Babylonian officials who serve the Chaldeans. If you dwell here and give your service to the Babylonian king, then you will live in peace and have nothing to fear.", "25": "But during the 7th month, Ishmael, (son of Nethaniah, Elishama's son) of the royal family, attacked Gedaliah with 10 male accomplices.

", "30": "The king also gave him a stipend on a daily basis for the rest of his life. Sitting in a foreign country and getting comfortable with pagan ways isn't the end of the story for Judah. A remnant will return to re-found Jerusalem and Israel, a story that is told in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. God will lift out of captivity those people who remain faithful to Him in spite of difficult circumstances. For the Northern Kingdom of Israel, their fate is not so clear. When Assyria exiles the northern Israelites all over the empire, those ten tribes are lost. For centuries people have developed theories as to what happened to them, some more far-fetched than others, but one thing is certain: whatever is left of the proper worship of God when they are captured dies among those people. Without that connection to Him, there is no one to save them."}

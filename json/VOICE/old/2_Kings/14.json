", "3": "Amaziah did what was good in the Eternal's eyes, but not to the extent that his forefather David had. Amaziah was a lot more like his father, Joash, than he was like David, for he was not as devoted to the Lord as David was. ", "4": "But the high places were not destroyed.

Take pleasure in what you have already won, and delight in your home for a while. Why would you want to stir up unnecessary troubles and have yourself and Judah taste defeat?", "11": "But Amaziah was stubborn and did not listen to Jehoash's advice.

While the writings of Jonah do not relate to these events, many of the other prophets' works do.

Joel, Jeremiah, and Zephaniah are doing the same thing in the Southern Kingdom, while Isaiah and Micah really get around, prophesying to both kingdoms.

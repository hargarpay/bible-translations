{"1": "Elijah and Elisha were leaving Gilgal when the Eternal One planned to snatch Elijah up into the heavens by the power of a fierce dancing wind.", "2": "Elijah (to Elisha): 2\u00a0I ask you to remain here. The Eternal has commanded me to go all the way to Bethel. Elisha: As certain as your own life and the life of the Eternal, I refuse to abandon you. So the two men traveled down to Bethel together, ", "3": "where Elisha was approached by the prophets' disciples who lived there. Prophets' Disciples: Are you aware that the Eternal One is going to snatch Elijah, your mentor, away from you today? Elisha: Yes, I am aware of this. I want you to keep quiet about it.", "4": "Elijah (to Elisha): 4\u00a0I beg you to remain here. The Eternal has commanded me to travel to Jericho. Elisha: As certain as your own life and the life of the Eternal, I refuse to abandon you. The two men then traveled to Jericho together, ", "5": "where the prophets' disciples living in Jericho approached Elisha. Prophets' Disciples: Are you aware that the Eternal One is going to snatch your mentor away from you today? Elisha: Yes, I am aware of this. I want you to keep quiet about it.", "6": "Elijah (to Elisha): 6\u00a0I beg you to remain here. The Eternal One has commanded me to travel to the Jordan River. Elisha: As certain as your own life and the life of the Eternal, I refuse to abandon you. So the two men then traveled to the Jordan River together.", "7": "While Elijah and Elisha were standing near the Jordan River, 50 of the prophets' disciples from that area stood at a distance from them on the other side. ", "8": "Elijah removed his cloak and rolled it up; then he struck the water with it, and the water divided. Elijah and Elisha then walked across on dry land. ", "9": "After the two had made it to the other side of the Jordan, Elijah spoke to Elisha. Elijah: Tell me what it is you would like me to do for you before I am taken away from you. Elisha: Please, I wish to receive a double portion of your spirit. As your successor, I want to have twice the portion of your power.", "10": "Elijah: 10\u00a0What you have requested of me is challenging, but it will be done if you witness my departure. But if you do not watch, then you will not have your double portion.", "11": "Now as the two continued walking along and talking as they normally did, something incredible happened. A blazing chariot pulled by blazing horses stormed down from the heavens and came between Elijah and Elisha. Then Elijah was swept up into heaven by the fiery storm. ", "12": "Elisha witnessed this amazing spectacle. Elisha: My father, O my father! The chariots and riders of Israel! Elijah and Enoch (Genesis 5:24) are the only two men in the Bible to leave earth while they are still alive. Although they are separated by centuries of time, both men are inseparable from God, and both leave quite a legacy: Elijah's successor, Elisha, continues his mentor's work, even calling out Elijah's name for help. Enoch's son, Methuselah, lives longer than anyone else ever has, which is proof that he, too, lives properly. Elisha never saw Elijah again. Elisha grabbed the clothes he was wearing, and he ripped them in half. ", "13-14": "He picked up Elijah's cloak, which had dropped to the ground when he was taken up into heaven, and then he went back to the Jordan riverbank and stood. He struck the water with the cloak. Elisha: Where is the Eternal One? Where is Elijah's True God? After Elisha struck the water, the Jordan River divided, just as when Elijah had struck the waters. Elisha then walked across on dry land.", "15": "The prophets' disciples at Jericho standing on the opposite shore were watching this. Prophets' Disciples: Elijah's powerful spirit now rests upon Elisha. Elijah's cloak now clothes Elisha. Then the prophets' disciples at Jericho approached Elisha and humbled themselves before him.", "16": "Prophets' Disciples: 16\u00a0There are 50 strong men along with us, your servants, who could go looking for your mentor. Perhaps the Spirit of the Eternal inside the whirlwind swept Elijah up into heaven and left him on some mountaintop or in some valley of the lowlands. Elisha: That won't be necessary.", "17": "But they kept asking his permission for a search, and he felt ashamed, so he finally agreed. They sent out a search party of 50 men who spent three days looking for Elijah, but they found no trace of him. ", "18": "The search party came back to Elisha while he was still in Jericho. Elisha: I told you not to go. He's gone from the earth.", "19": "Men of Jericho: 19\u00a0Life is pleasant in this city; and as you can see, the city is in an advantageous location, except for the water. It's contaminated, so the land is barren.", "20": "Elisha: 20\u00a0Fetch me a new bowl, and pour some salt into it. So they brought him the bowl with the salt he had requested. ", "21": "He then walked outside to the water spring and tossed some salt into it. Elisha: This is the Eternal's message: \u201cThis water is now entirely pure. It will no longer bring death or cause the earth to be barren.\u201d", "22": "This water has been potable ever since, just as Elisha said.", "23": "Elisha then traveled north to Bethel retracing his last steps with Elijah. On his way there, a large group of young boys came out of the city and began making fun of him: \u201cKeep going, baldy! Keep going, baldy!\u201d ", "24": "When Elisha looked back at them, he spoke against them by the authority of the Eternal. Almost immediately, 2 female bears walked out of the forest and ripped up 42 of the young boys. ", "25": "Elisha then returned to Mount Carmel, and he went back to Samaria."}

", "23": "All your men are to appear before Me, the Lord and one True God of Israel, three times a year at these feasts.

No one will try to take your land while you are going up those three times a year to appear before Me, your God.", "25": "You are not to offer blood from a sacrifice with bread made with yeast. Do not leave any of the meat from the Passover sacrifice until morning. ", "26": "Offer only the best of your harvest when you bring a gift to the house of the Eternal One your God.

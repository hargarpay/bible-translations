{"1": "Eternal One: If someone steals an ox or a sheep and either kills or sells it for profit, then he must pay five oxen for the one ox he stole or four sheep for the one sheep he stole. ", "4": "But if the stolen animal\u2014the ox or donkey or sheep\u2014is still alive and in his possession when he is caught, then the thief must pay the owner double. ", "2-3": "b\u00a0A thief must make restitution for what he has taken. If he has no means of doing so, he must be sold to pay for his theft. If a person attacks a thief in the act of breaking into his house and the thief is killed during the attack, then the homeowner is innocent of blood guilt. 3a\u00a0It is different if the sun has already risen; so any homeowner who kills a thief during the day must be considered guilty of bloodshed.[a]", "5": "The difference between these two situations is the difference between daylight and dark. If a homeowner is protecting his property at night and injures a thief, it is to be treated as a case of self-defense. But if the crime takes place during the light of day, it is not necessary to incapacitate or capture the thief; it is necessary only to recognize the thief and bear truthful witness against him in court. The right to personal property does not eclipse the right to life. Eternal One: 5\u00a0If someone allows his animals to graze a field or vineyard until it is bare and then lets his animals wander over onto a neighbor's field, then he must compensate his neighbor from the very best of his field and vineyard.", "6": "If someone starts a fire and the fire spreads and sets the thorn bushes ablaze, and eventually that fire burns up stacks of harvested grain and everything growing in the fields, then the person who started the fire is responsible and must pay reparations for what was lost.", "7": "If someone gives his neighbor money or items to keep for him and it is stolen from his neighbor's house, then if the thief is captured, he must pay double for what he stole.

If God finds the neighbor guilty, he must pay double for what he stole.", "10": "If someone leaves a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other kind of livestock in his friend's keeping, and the animal dies or is injured or disappears while no one is watching, ", "11": "then the two are to make an oath in the presence of the Eternal. The neighbor must swear he had nothing to do with the loss of the animal, and the owner of the animal must accept his statement and not demand any compensation for the loss.", "12": "But if the animal was stolen while in his neighbor's care, then the neighbor must compensate the owner.

", "23": "If you do oppress them and they cry out to Me, I will certainly hear them, ", "24": "and My wrath will be kindled. I will make sure you are slaughtered by your enemy's sword, and your own wives and children will become widows and orphans.", "25": "If you loan money to any of the poor among My people, do not treat them as borrowers and act as their creditors by charging interest.

", "27": "You see that coat covers his body and may be his only protection against the cold. What do you think he would sleep in? When he calls out for Me, I will hear his cry. I am kind and compassionate as you should be when a fellow Israelite is in need.", "28": "Do not curse the one True God or any rulers of your people.[b]", "29": "God demands respect from His people and expects His people to honor those He puts in charge.

The Israelites are first a nomadic people; later when they are settled, they become a shepherding people. For them to offer their best and dearest to God means most naturally an animal, one without blemish and young. These animals are the basis of their economy and provide them with food, clothing, shelter, and security. To offer God an animal sacrifice is to offer a piece of their lives. So offerings are very personal and differ based on what families can afford. In some cases, the sacrifices are completely consumed, but in others the priests and the people take some of the meat home to their own tables. This way the whole community shares in the bounty of the sacrifice. Eternal One: 31\u00a0Take the meat of the ordination ram and boil it in a sacred place.

", "36": "Offer a bull as an offering every day for seven days to purify them from sin. Cleanse the altar and consecrate it by anointing it with oil. ", "37": "For seven days you must purify the altar and consecrate it. As a result of these rituals it will be most holy and anything that touches the altar will become holy.", "38": "Here are the sacrifices you are to offer on the altar: every day offer two one-year-old lambs. ", "39": "Offer one lamb in the morning, and the other at twilight. ", "40": "With the lamb offered in the morning bring two quarts of fine flour mixed together with one quart of beaten olive oil, and one quart of wine for the drink offering. ", "41": "With the second lamb offered at twilight, bring the same gifts of grain and drink that you offered with the morning lamb. These offerings by fire presented to Me will give off a pleasing aroma. ", "42": "From generation to generation, the ritual of the burnt offering is to begin daily at the entrance of the congregation tent in My presence. I will meet with you and talk with you there. ", "43": "I will meet with My people Israel there, for My glory will make that place sacred. ", "44": "I will sanctify the congregation tent and the altar. I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve as My priests. ", "45": "I will live among the Israelites and be their God.

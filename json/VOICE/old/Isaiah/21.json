{"1": "Isaiah is given a vision of a frightening event. It comes roaring at him like a sandstorm blowing across the Negev. The vision is harsh and violent, but very real. The prophet describes this vision and the others like it as \u201cburdens,\u201d for it is hard to bear such bad news. This particular vision is given to the \u201csea of Wilderness\u201d or Babylon; it is the second prophecy predicting Babylon's punishment (chapters 13\u201314). He addresses a series of burdensome messages to other cities, nations, and peoples. What is common to all of these prophecies is that God is angry with these nations for the harsh way they treat His covenant people, and He will not just let it go. So God has decided to punish them, and He warns his prophet ahead of time what is about to happen. This message is welcome news to the Judeans who suffered beneath the cruel tyranny of these foreign powers. On the one hand, God used Judah's enemies to accomplish His purpose. On the other, they have overstepped the limit.

As a woman in labor wrenches and writhes, I can hardly bear the news. I cannot hear because I'm bent over with agony. I cannot see because I'm deep in the fog of depression.", "4": "My heart skips a beat; my mind is buzzing, terribly unsettled. Horror and trembling rattle the serenity of the evening I longed for.", "5": "Meanwhile, the ones who are in charge are spreading out a feast, eating and drinking just like normal. I want to say to them: \u201cGet up, officers. Oil your shields, and be prepared!\u201d", "6": "Because the Eternal has told me, Eternal One: Get someone to keep an eye on things. Have him report whatever he sees.", "7": "Tell him to watch closely for riders on teams of horses, donkeys, and camels. If he sees them, put him on full alert.", "8": "Sentinel: I stand guard at the watchtower, Lord, day after day. I never leave my post during the night.", "9": "Look! They're coming just as you said: a chariot driver and a team of horses. The driver tells me \u201cBabylon is fallen! Our oppressor has fallen and all their idols, worthless imposters of the one True God, are shattered on the ground.\u201d", "10": "O, my people, who have been threshed and winnowed like wheat, I am telling you what the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, Israel's God, said.", "11": "A message about Duma: Someone is calling me from Seir.

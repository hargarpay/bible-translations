{"1": "I will not keep quiet for Zion's sake; I will not remain silent Until Jerusalem's justice shines like the light of a new day and her liberation blazes like a torch in the dead of night.", "2": "Jerusalem, the nations of the world will witness your righteousness, the most powerful world leaders will see your brilliance, And you will be called something new, something brand new, a name given by none other than the Eternal One.", "3": "And you will be the crowning glory of the Eternal's power, a royal crown cradled in His palm and held aloft by your God for all to see.", "4": "People won't talk about you anymore using words like \u201cforsaken\u201d or \u201cempty.\u201d Instead, you will be called \u201cMy delight\u201d and the land around you \u201cMarried,\u201d because the Eternal is pleased with you and has bound Himself to your land.", "5": "As a young man marries the woman he loves, so your sons will marry you, Jerusalem. As a groom takes joy in his bride, so your God will take joy in you.", "6": "I have stationed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem. Day and night, they never stop calling out. You, too, must not rest or grow silent; keep reminding the Eternal to watch over Jerusalem.", "7": "Tirelessly pester God\u2014give Him no rest\u2014until He reestablishes Jerusalem and makes it worthy of praise throughout the whole world.", "8": "The Eternal has promised with all divine power and might: Eternal One: I will never again turn over your assets to your enemies, never feed them from your grain stores Or give them the wine you have labored to produce.", "9": "Instead, those who harvest the grain will eat its bounty, and offer praise to the Eternal; And those who gather the grapes will drink of their richness in the courtyards outside the temple.", "10": "So ready yourselves to pass through the gates, from old to new.

The \u201cpeople\u201d ask a question, and God rings out a response. Dramatic, to say the least. What trials and tribulations the Israelites have been through! What highs and lows! It is all God's doing in response to their faithlessness. But this is history, and now they find themselves living and working in a brand new time; a new day is coming\u2014of restoration, peace, and glorious reputation for God's people such as they've never had before. The renewal is international in scope, without peer in the world. And this, too, is God's doing. His capacity for mercy is great. He loves His people beyond comprehension. This is why He should be recognized and appreciated by all as the one True God. He keeps saving and delivering, restoring and supporting the people, just as God has done since that moment of binding promise made so long ago. Eternal One: Say to the daughter of Zion \u201cSee, your salvation is coming; your liberation is on the way\u2014 God's reward is with Him: His work is by His side.\u201d", "12": "And they will be called \u201cThe Holy People, Redeemed by the Eternal\u201d; Jerusalem's new name will be \u201cDesirable City, No Longer Forsaken.\u201d"}

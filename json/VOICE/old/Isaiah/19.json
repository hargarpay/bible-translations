{"1": "A message about Egypt: The Eternal One will come winging in to Egypt On a swiftly moving cloud, making her idols quake. The Egyptians themselves will lose heart in the face of God.", "2-4": ", 4\u00a0The Lord, the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, says, Eternal One: I will subject the Egyptians to oppressive forces and heartless leadership of a dictator-king. I will make them turn against each other, Egyptian against Egyptian, a civil war, Right down to the houses within a neighborhood\u2014 city against city, district against district.[a] They'll lose all courage and I'll frustrate their plans. They'll seek the advice of long dead ancestors and empty idols, mediums and fortune-tellers. But it is I who determine their fate.", "5-7": "Egypt's waterways and everything that lives in them will dry up and die\u2014 saltwater and fresh, standing pools and running streams will all evaporate. All the reeds and rushes along the river's edge will wither and die and rot away. All the crops sown by the Nile will turn brittle and dry, to be blown away\u2014completely away\u2014by sultry winds.", "8": "The people who depend on these waters for their livelihood will see their lives and future evaporate before them.

And those who count themselves among the Pharaoh's smartest counselors Base their advice on bizarre flights of fancy. How can you tell Pharaoh, \u201cI am among the long line of Egypt's wise and an heir of ancient kings\u201d?", "12": "I certainly don't see any such sages. If they're here, they should be able to tell you what the Eternal One, Commander of heavenly armies, has in store for Egypt.", "13": "The elite, the nobles from the northern delta south to bustling Memphis, have been overconfident, deluded fools.

God has frustrated Egypt's efforts in everything. Weaving and sick like an everyday drunk.", "15": "There will be nothing left for Egypt to do. Nobody\u2014no head, no tail, no noble palm, no lowly reed\u2014 will be able to help Egypt.", "16": "Then, in that day, when the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, raises His hand and displays His power, the Egyptians will cower like frightened women. ", "17": "Egypt will even be terrified of our little Judah. Just the word \u201cJudah\u201d will set everyone trembling and shaking because of what the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, plans to do against them.", "18": "In that day, five cities in Egypt, one of which is called the city of destruction,[b] will adopt the language we speak in Canaan and swear to remain faithful to the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies.", "19": "When that day arrives, there will be an altar for rituals, marking the Eternal's sacred space right there in the middle of Egypt, and a pillar erected to Him at its border.

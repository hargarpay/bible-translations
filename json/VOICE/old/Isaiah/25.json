{"1": "Eternal One, You are my God. I will lift You up and praise Your name. Because You have made wonders marvelous and beautiful\u2014 the most ancient designs holding strong and sure.", "2": "Your power is awesome. You have brought down whole cities, turned fortresses and strongholds into piles of sticks and rubble. A citadel of foreigners is no longer even a city. Those structures are gone forever.", "3": "This is why nations strong and mighty will glorify You; the cities of ruthless people will fear and respect You.", "4": "Because You stand up for the poor and weak, You comfort and empower them in their distress, Giving them safe harbor and cool shade when it's hot; You shelter them from their oppressors' blows As a strong wall holds back the driving rain.", "5": "You shelter from the relentless heat of the desert. You quiet the clamor of outsiders, ease them to stillness. Like a full, dark cloud relieves the heat, You silence the arrogant song of the violent.", "6": "The Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, is preparing a feast, a feast for everyone on this mystical mountain With aged wine and good food, the finest wine and choicest meat.", "7": "And God will swallow up the oppression that weighs us down. He will take away the heavy shroud that is draped over all peoples of the world.", "8": "God will swallow up death forever. The Lord, the Eternal, will wipe away the tears from each and every face And deflect the scorn and shame His people endure from the whole world, for the Eternal determined that it should be so.", "9": "And in that moment, at that glorious time, people will say, People: This is our God! We put our hope in him. We knew that He would save us! This is our God, the Eternal for whom we waited. Let us rejoice and celebrate in His liberation.", "10": "For on this mountain, the powerful hand of the Eternal abides. He will smash and tread Moab like straw on manure.", "11": "And God will reach out, like a swimmer pulling water, and drag down their arrogance and everything that made them proud.", "12": "God will bring down their strongest walls, their impenetrable defenses, and grind them to the ground until they are only dust."}

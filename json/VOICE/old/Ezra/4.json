Northern Enemies: Let us help you build this temple to the True God, whom we both follow. You see, our families began sacrificing to Him when King Esarhaddon of Assyria sent us to colonize the Northern Kingdom after he conquered it.", "3": "Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the Tribal Leaders: 3\u00a0You have nothing in common with us! You are not heirs to the Lord's promise to Abraham. King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us to build the Eternal God of Israel's temple, so we will do it by ourselves.", "4": "To intimidate the returning Jews from building, the people of the land made the returning exiles afraid to build ", "5": "and bribed counselors to hinder the Jews' efforts throughout the reigns of Cyrus and Darius, the kings of Persia.", "6": "The elders recognize that the Assyrian colonists have impure motives.

The Jews have to fight to rebuild the temple during the reigns of Cyrus and Darius, and decades later they will fight to rebuild Jerusalem.

", "15": "We suggest that if you read your predecessors' court documents and learn about the history of the Jews of Jerusalem, you will find that they are notoriously rebellious, harming kings and provinces and instigating revolts.

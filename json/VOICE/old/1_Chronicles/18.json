", "4": "From Hadadezer David seized 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He cut the leg muscles of all the chariot horses, reserving only 100 for future use with the chariots. ", "5": "When the armies of Damascus in Aram came to help their kinsman Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 Arameans. ", "6": "Then David built garrisons in Damascus, and the Arameans served him and brought him tribute. The Eternal helped David, ensuring his victory, wherever he went.

Edom, descended from Jacob's older brother Esau, lost any chance of being God's chosen people when Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for stew. Moab and Ammon were formed by the descendants of an incestuous relationship between Abraham's nephew Lot and Lot's daughters. The Philistines, although not related to the Israelites, were frequent enemies whose military prowess threatened Israelite tribes on many occasions. And the Amalekites, also descended from Esau, were almost constant enemies of the Israelites, employing ruthless tactics in their war mongering. By subduing these nations, David not only secures the safety of Israel, but he reaffirms God's selection of Israel as His people over all the other nations in the land. One of David's chiefs, Abishai (son of Zeruiah), defeated 18,000 Edomites in the valley of Salt. ", "13": "He built garrisons in Edom, and all the people of that nation served David.

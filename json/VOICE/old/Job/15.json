As Job has revealed, these heavenly messengers are with God all the time. They do His bidding. No one could possibly know His rules better than they do or have more motivation to follow them, yet they still chose to disobey God. Eliphaz's point is clear: no human could possibly claim to be above the temptation to sin when God's heavenly envoys are not. Eliphaz: I will tell it like it is, so listen.

You are all terrible as comforters!", "3": "Have we reached the end of your windy words, or are you sick with something that compels you to argue with me?", "4": "If we were to trade places, I could rattle on as you do. I could compose eloquent speeches as you do and shake my head smugly at you and your problems.", "5": "But I believe I would use my words to encourage you; my lips would move only to offer you relief.", "6": "And yet, I am not you, you are not me, and my words are of no real use: When I speak, my pain is not relieved; if I remain silent, it does not go away.", "7": "God has drained me utterly; He has made those near to me desolate\u2014killed my family and my servants.", "8": "You have shriveled me up; my withered form stands as a witness against me; my body, haggard and thin, testifies to my face.", "9": "In anger He hunts me down and tears at me; in rancor His teeth grind on my flesh; His eyes are locked on me as a foe, eager to destroy still more of me.", "10": "My foes taunt me, their mouths gape in derision, they slap my cheek in disgust, and they conspire against me.", "11": "God has forsaken me to young thugs and flung me into the hands of evildoers who lie in wait for me.", "12": "I was living a good life\u2014a quiet, peaceful life\u2014 when He began to beat on me; He throttled my neck, tore me apart, and then propped me up at the far end of the field, making me a target.", "13": "His archers have now gathered around me. In cold blood He splits my belly open and spills my bile on the earth.", "14": "He charged like a soldier storming a stronghold until my walls were breached, broken down, one after another.", "15": "Job in his despair and frustration responds as he and his friends have been taught by previous generations to display grief: by donning sackcloth and covering the head with dust to show devastation, as if everything has been lost even to the point of death. Job: Well, I have sewed the sackcloth to my very skin and buried my mighty forehead in the dirt.", "16": "My face, red and hot, boils over in tears; the shadow of darkness lies heavy on my eyelids,", "17": "No matter that my hands are free of violence, and my prayer is pure.", "18": "O earth, do not conceal my blood! And when they seek to silence my cry, refuse a place for its burial.", "19": "Look! Even at this very moment, my witness is there, in heaven; my advocate is seated on high.", "20": "My only friends scoff at me; they persist in mocking me; even now my eyes well up in tears to God,", "21": "Appealing to God as a mere man, as a human being might for the sake of his friend.", "22": "Only a few years left now, and I will go down the path from which I cannot return."}

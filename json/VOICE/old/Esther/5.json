The king was sitting on his throne facing the palace entrance. ", "2": "He was pleased when he noticed Queen Esther waiting in the court. He extended his gold scepter with his hand, inviting her in. Esther walked toward him, and when she was close enough, she reached out and touched the king's scepter.", "3": "King Ahasuerus: 3\u00a0What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? I'll give you anything\u2014even half of my kingdom\u2014all you need to do is ask.", "4": "Queen Esther: 4\u00a0If it would please you, my king, I'd like for you and Haman to come today to a banquet I have made in your honor.", "5": "King Ahasuerus (looking at his servants): 5\u00a0Go and find Haman this instant, so we can do as Esther desires. So the king and Haman came to Esther's banquet. ", "6": "As Haman, the king, and Esther were enjoying the wine at the end of her banquet, the king pressed the question. King Ahasuerus: Now, my queen, what is your request? I promise that half of my kingdom is not too much to ask! Don't be afraid to ask for whatever you want.", "7": "Queen Esther: 7\u00a0I do want something. My request is: ", "8": "If I have found favor before you, and if you truly desire to grant my request, would you and Haman join me again tomorrow for another banquet I will prepare?

Instead, he went home and spent time with friends and Zeresh, his wife. ", "11": "Haman spent the evening bragging to them about being rich and having lots of sons in his family. He even boasted about his relationship with the king, talking to his guests about his promotion above all of his fellow nobles and the officials of the king.", "12": "Haman: 12\u00a0And that's not all! Queen Esther invited me today to dine with her and the king. Just the three of us! And guess what? She's invited me again tomorrow. What do you think about that? ", "13": "But I must be honest; seeing that Jew, Mordecai, as I pass through the gate makes it difficult to celebrate any of my good fortune.", "14": "Then his wife Zeresh and all of his friends came up with an idea. Zeresh and His Friends: You should make a wood pole 75 feet high! Tomorrow morning, have the king sentence Mordecai to be executed on it. Then you'll be able to have a good time at the banquet with the king. Haman thought the idea was brilliant. So he had the pole made."}

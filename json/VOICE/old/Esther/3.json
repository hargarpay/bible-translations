", "2": "The officials at the king's gate all bowed down before Haman and paid him homage because the king commanded this.

Now the tables are turned, and Agag's descendant exercises nearly supreme power over Mordecai and the other subjects of Persian power. But, true to his Jewish teaching, Mordecai bows to no man nor pays him homage. That honor is reserved for God and Him alone. Mordecai's actions came to the attention of the king's officials standing at the gate. Officials (looking at Mordecai): Why are you disobeying the king's command?", "4": "The officers questioned him daily about his disobedience to the king, but Mordecai refused to listen and bow down.

Their laws differ from all other peoples', and they do not keep your laws. Therefore it's not a good idea for you to tolerate them or their actions any longer. ", "9": "If it is your wish, sign an order that these people be destroyed, and I will bear all the costs. I'll pay 375 tons of silver directly to those who carry out the king's business in order to relieve the royal treasury of the expense.", "10": "Not knowing which group of foreigners was being targeted, the king took his signet ring, the symbol of his power and authority, from his finger and passed it to Haman (son of Hammedatha, the Agagite), who hated the Jews.", "11": "King Ahasuerus (to Haman): 11\u00a0The money is yours and the people are yours also to do with as you wish.", "12": "On the 13th day of the 1st month, the royal secretaries were summoned. The king's order was written down exactly the way Haman dictated it to all of the king's rulers of the regions, governors of the provinces, and nobles of the ethnic groups.

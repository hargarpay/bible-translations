{"1": "King Ahasuerus and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther; ", "2": "and while they were drinking wine, the king posed his question once again. King Ahasuerus: What is your request, Queen Esther? I'm willing to give you anything you want. Just make your request. Even if it's half the kingdom you desire, I will make it happen!", "3": "Queen Esther: 3\u00a0If you favor me, my king, and if it pleases you, spare my life. That's all I'm asking for\u2014that my people and I be spared. That is my wish. ", "4": "There are some, my king, who wish to rid your kingdom of us. For my people and I have been sold, marked for destruction and massacre. Now if the plan were simply to sell our men and women into slavery, I would have kept my mouth closed because that would not have been important enough to disturb you, my king.", "5": "Esther's plea to Ahasuerus echoes the words of Moses to Pharaoh: \u201cLet my people go.\u201d King Ahasuerus: 5\u00a0Who has targeted your people? Where is this man who dares to do this?", "6": "Queen Esther (pointing to Haman): 6\u00a0The man responsible for these actions is wicked Haman. He is vile, and an enemy to my people. In that moment, Haman's joy turned to terror before the king and queen. ", "7": "Angered, the king shoved away from the table, left his wine, and walked into the palace garden. But Haman, aware that King Ahasuerus had already sealed his fate, didn't follow behind. Instead, he pleaded with Queen Esther to spare his life. ", "8": "In desperation, he threw himself onto the couch where Queen Esther was sitting, just as King Ahasuerus walked back from the garden to the place where the wine and the banquet had been set. King Ahasuerus: Haman, will you even violate my queen right here in the palace, where I can see you? As soon as the king gave the order, the royal eunuchs covered Haman's face. His fate had been sealed. ", "9": "One of those eunuchs was Harbonah. Harbonah: Look! Haman has prepared a 75-foot pole for execution in his own courtyard. He was hoping to use it to hang Mordecai, the man who spoke up and saved the king. King Ahasuerus: Well, hang him on it!", "10": "So they took Haman and killed him and displayed him on the pole he had made ready for Mordecai. And King Ahasuerus' anger subsided."}

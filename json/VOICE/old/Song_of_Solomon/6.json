{"1": "Young Women of Jerusalem (to her): Where has your love gone, most beautiful of women? Do you know which direction he went so we can help you find him?", "2": "They pass through many obstacles as they celebrate their union in different venues. Love is found in a garden or a parental home. Ecstasy comes in a dream or reality. Her: Women of Jerusalem, I know where my love is. My love has gone into his garden Among the beds of aromatic spices, like a gazelle grazing among his gardens and a gardener gathering the lilies.", "3": "I belong to my love, and my love to me. He feeds his flock among the lilies.", "4": "Him (to her): You are beautiful, my dear, as beautiful as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as regal as an army beneath their banners.", "5": "Turn your eyes from me because they overpower me as always. Your hair moves as gracefully as a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Mount Gilead.", "6": "Your teeth are pearl white like a flock of sheep shorn, fresh up from a wash. Each is perfect and paired with another; not one of them is lost.", "7": "Your cheeks are rosy and round beneath your veil, like the halves of a pomegranate.", "8": "There may be 60 queens and 80 concubines\u2014 there may be more virgins than can be counted\u2014", "9": "But my dove, my perfect love is the only one for me, the only daughter of her mother, the pure and favored child to the one who bore her.

Come back, come back to us, so that we can look upon you. Him: Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as you would stare at the dance of joyous victory at Mahanaim?"}

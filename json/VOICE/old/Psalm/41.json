{"1": "The first four books of Psalms end with a variation of the doxology found in verse 13: \u201cBlessed is the Eternal, the True God of Israel. Always and Eternal. Amen and Amen.\u201d This declaration not only provides a natural break\u2014a seam\u2014between the five books, but it also summarizes an essential theme of the psalms. You see, the Book of Psalms is primarily a book of praise to God for His creation, mercy, and salvation. Even when life is hard, our enemies strong, and our health poor, God can be praised for life itself and the ultimate victory to come for those who trust Him. Blessed are those who consider the helpless. The Eternal will stay near them, leading them to safety in times of bitter struggle.", "2": "The Eternal defends them and preserves them, and His blessing will find them in the land He gave them. He moves ahead to frustrate their enemies' plans.", "3": "When sickness comes, the Eternal is beside them\u2014 to comfort them on their sickbeds and restore them to health.", "4": "And me? I cry out to Him, \u201cHeal my soul, O Eternal One, and show mercy because I have sinned against You!\u201d", "5": "My enemies are talking about me even now: \u201cWhen will death come for him and his name be forgotten?\u201d", "6": "As they sit with me under my roof, their well wishes are empty lies. They listen to my story and then turn it around to tell their own version on the street.", "7": "Across the city, crowds whisper lies about me. Their hate is strong, and they search for ways to harm me.", "8": "Some are saying: \u201cSome vile disease has gotten hold of him. The bed he lies in will be his deathbed.\u201d", "9": "Even my best friend, my confidant who has eaten my bread will stab me in the back.[a]", "10": "But You, Eternal One, show mercy to me. Extend Your gracious hand, and help me up. I need to pay them back for what they've done to me.", "11": "I realize now that Your favor has come to me, for my enemies have yet to declare victory over me.", "12": "You know and uphold me\u2014a man of honor. You grant me strength and life forever in Your presence.", "13": "Blessed is the Eternal, the True God of Israel. Always and Eternal. Amen and Amen."}

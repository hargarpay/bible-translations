{"1": "Psalm 100 is one of the best known and most loved psalms. This hymn of thanksgiving invites the whole world to come to God's temple in Jerusalem and enter its sacred spaces with unbridled joy and hearts filled with gratitude. And why should we? The psalm provides the answer. Not only has God created us\u2014a gracious act of love in and of itself\u2014but He has made us His own people. He has chosen us and loved us. As with Psalm 23, God's people are cast in the role as sheep living well in His pasture. The psalm ends on a high note of confidence and hope. At all times\u2014but perhaps more in times of difficulty\u2014we need to be reminded of what is true. Regardless of what seems to be happening around us, the Eternal is good; His love and faithfulness will endure forever. Raise your voices; make a beautiful noise to the Eternal, all the earth.", "2": "Serve the Eternal gladly; enter into His presence singing songs of joy!", "3": "Know this: the Eternal One Himself is the True God. He is the One who made us; we have not made ourselves; we are His people, like sheep grazing in His fields.", "4": "Go through His gates, giving thanks; walk through His courts, giving praise. Offer Him your gratitude and praise His holy name.", "5": "Because the Eternal is good, His loyal love and mercy will never end, and His truth will last throughout all generations."}

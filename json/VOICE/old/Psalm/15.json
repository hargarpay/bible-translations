{"1": "A recurring theme in the psalms is the dwelling place of God and its importance in worship. This Davidic psalm considers the moral qualities of the person who wishes to approach God. Eternal One, who is invited to stay in Your dwelling? Who is granted passage to Your holy mountain?", "2": "Here is the answer: The one who lives with integrity, does what is right, and speaks honestly with truth from the heart.", "3": "The one who doesn't speak evil against others or wrong his neighbor, or slander his friends.", "4": "The one who loathes the loathsome, honors those who fear the Eternal, And keeps all promises no matter the cost.", "5": "The one who does not lend money with gain in mind and cannot be bought to harm an innocent name. If you live this way, you will not be shaken and will live together with the Lord."}

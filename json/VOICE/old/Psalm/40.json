{"1": "I waited a long time for the Eternal; He finally knelt down to hear me. He listened to my weak and whispered cry.", "2": "He reached down and drew me from the deep, dark hole where I was stranded, mired in the muck and clay. With a gentle hand, He pulled me out To set me down safely on a warm rock; He held me until I was steady enough to continue the journey again.", "3": "As if that were not enough, because of Him my mind is clearing up. Now I have a new song to sing\u2014 a song of praise to the One who saved me. Because of what He's done, many people will see and come to trust in the Eternal.", "4": "Surely those who trust the Eternal\u2014 who don't trust in proud, powerful people Or in people who care little for reality, chasing false gods\u2014 surely they are happy, as I have become.", "5": "You have done so many wonderful things, had so many tender thoughts toward us, Eternal my God, that go on and on, ever increasing. Who can compare with You?", "6": "Sacrifices and offerings are not what You want, but You've opened my ears,[a] and now I understand. Burnt offerings and sin offerings are not what please You.", "7": "So I said, \u201cSee, I have come to do Your will, as it is inscribed of me in the scroll.", "8": "I am pleased to live how You want, my God. Your law is etched into my heart and my soul.\u201d", "9": "I have encouraged Your people with the message of righteousness, in Your great assembly (look and see), I haven't kept quiet about these things; You know this, Eternal One.", "10": "I have not kept Your righteousness to myself, sealed up in the secret places of my heart; instead, I boldly tell others how You save and how loyal You are. I haven't been shy to talk about Your love, nor have I been afraid to tell Your truth before the great assembly of Your people.", "11": "Please, Eternal One, don't hold back Your kind ways from me. I need Your strong love and truth to stand watch over me and keep me from harm.", "12": "Right now I can't see because I am surrounded by troubles; my sins and shortcomings have caught up to me, so I am swimming in darkness. Like the hairs on my head, there are too many to count, so my heart deserts me.", "13": "O Eternal One, please rescue me. O Eternal One, hurry; I need Your help.", "14": "May those who are trying to destroy me be humiliated and ashamed instead; May those who want to ruin my reputation be cut off and embarrassed.", "15": "May those who try to catch me off guard, those who look at me and say, \u201cAha, we've trapped you,\u201d be caught in their own shame instead.", "16": "But may all who look for You discover true joy and happiness in You; May those who cherish how You save them always say, \u201cO Eternal One, You are great and are first in our hearts.\u201d", "17": "Meanwhile, I am empty and need so much, but I know the Lord is thinking of me. You are my help; only You can save me, my True God. Please hurry."}

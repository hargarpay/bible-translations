{"1": "O True God, You are my God, the One whom I trust. I seek You with every fiber of my being. In this dry and weary land with no water in sight, my soul is dry and longs for You. My body aches for You, for Your presence.", "2": "I have seen You in Your sanctuary and have been awed by Your power and glory.", "3": "Your steadfast love is better than life itself, so my lips will give You all my praise.", "4": "I will bless You with every breath of my life; I will lift up my hands in praise to Your name.", "5": "My soul overflows with satisfaction, as when I feast on foods rich in marrow and fat; with excitement in my heart and joy on my lips, I offer You praise.", "6": "Often at night I lie in bed and remember You, meditating on Your greatness till morning smiles through my window.", "7": "You have been my constant helper; therefore, I sing for joy under the protection of Your wings.", "8": "My soul clings to You; Your right hand reaches down and holds me up.", "9": "But as for those who try to destroy my life, they will descend into eternal shadows, deep beneath the earth.", "10": "They will fall by the sword, and wild dogs will feast on their corpses.", "11": "But the king will find his joy in the True God; all who make pledges and invoke His name will celebrate, while the mindless prattle of cheaters and deceivers will be silenced."}

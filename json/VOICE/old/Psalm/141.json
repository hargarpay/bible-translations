{"1": "O Eternal One, I call upon You. Come quickly! Listen to my voice as I call upon You!", "2": "Consider my prayer as an offering of incense that rises before You; when I stand with my hands outstretched pleading toward the heavens, consider it as an evening offering.", "3": "Guard my mouth, O Eternal One; control what I say. Keep a careful watch on every word I speak.", "4": "Don't allow my deepest desires to steer me toward doing what is wrong or associating with wicked people Or joining in their wicked works or tasting any of their pleasures.", "5": "Let those who do right strike me down in kindness and correct me in love. Their kind correction washes over my head like pure oil; do not let me be foolish and refuse such compassion. Still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked:", "6": "Their judges will be thrown from the edges of cliffs and crushed upon the rocks below, and the wicked will hear my words and realize that what I said was pleasing.", "7": "Just as when a farmer plows and breaks open the earth, leaving clumps of dirt scattered along the rows, our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave.", "8": "My gaze is fixed upon You, Eternal One, my Lord; in You I find safety and protection. Do not abandon me and leave me defenseless.", "9": "Protect me from the jaws of the trap my enemies have set for me and from the snares of those who work evil.", "10": "May the wicked be caught in their own nets while I alone escape unharmed."}

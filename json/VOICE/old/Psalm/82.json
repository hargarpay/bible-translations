{"1": "Psalm 82 provides an image of a heavenly scene in which God accuses His heavenly messengers of not caring for the poor and pursuing justice. The True God stands to preside over the heavenly council. He pronounces judgment on the so-called gods.", "2": "He asks: \u201cHow long will you judge dishonestly and be partial to the wicked?\u201d [pause][a]", "3": "\u201cStand up for the poor and the orphan; advocate for the rights of the afflicted and those in need.", "4": "Deliver the poor and the needy; rescue them from their evil oppressors.\u201d", "5": "These bullies are ignorant; they have no understanding of My ways. So as they walk in darkness, the foundations of the earth tremble.", "6": "I said, \u201cThough you are gods[b] and children of the Most High,", "7": "You will die no differently than any mortal; you will fall like one of the princes.\u201d", "8": "Rise up, O True God; judge the rulers of the earth, for all the nations are Yours."}

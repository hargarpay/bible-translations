{"1": "Plead for me; clear my name, O God. Prove me innocent before immoral people; Save me from their lies, their unjust thoughts and deeds.", "2": "You are the True God\u2014my shelter, my protector, the one whom I lean on. Why have You turned away from me? Rejected me? Why must I go around, overwrought, mourning, suffering under the weight of my enemies?", "3": "O my God, shine Your light and truth to help me see clearly, To lead me to Your holy mountain, to Your home.", "4": "Then I will go to God's altar with nothing to hide. I will go to God, my rapture; I will sing praises to You and play my strings, unloading my cares, unleashing my joys, to You, God, my God.", "5": "O my soul, why are you so overwrought? Why are you so disturbed? Why can't I just hope in God? Despite all my emotions, I will hope in God again. I will believe and praise the One who saves me and is my life, My Savior and my God."}

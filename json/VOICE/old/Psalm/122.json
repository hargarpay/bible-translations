{"1": "This is a Davidic psalm celebrating the grandeur and significance of Jerusalem and its temple. It is ironic that Jerusalem means \u201ccity of peace\u201d since more battles have been fought over it than over any other city. I was so happy when my fellow pilgrims said, \u201cLet's go to the house of the Eternal!\u201d", "2": "We have made the journey, and now we are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem.", "3": "Jerusalem! What a magnificent city! Buildings so close together, so compact.", "4": "God's people belong here. Every tribe of the Eternal makes its way to Jerusalem\u2014 Just as God decreed for Israel to come together and give thanks to the Eternal.", "5": "In Jerusalem, justice is the order of the day because there sit the judges and kings, the descendants of David.", "6": "Ask heaven to grant peace to Jerusalem: \u201cMay those who love you prosper.", "7": "O Jerusalem, may His peace fill this entire city! May this citadel be quiet and at ease!\u201d", "8": "It's because of people\u2014my family, friends, and acquaintances\u2014 that I say, \u201cMay peace permeate you.\u201d", "9": "And because the house of Eternal One, our God, is here, know this: I will always seek your good!"}

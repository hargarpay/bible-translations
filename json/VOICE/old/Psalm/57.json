David found real security not in the hidden recesses of the caves but in the shadow of God's wings. Mercy. May Your mercy come to me, O God, for my soul is safe within You, the guardian of my life. I will seek protection in the shade of Your wings until the destruction has passed.", "2": "I cry out to God, the Most High, to God who always does what is good for me.", "3": "Out of heaven my rescue comes. He dispatches His mercy and truth And goes after whoever tries to run over me. [pause][c]", "4": "I am surrounded by lions; I lie in a den of ravenous beasts. Those around me have spears and arrows for teeth, a sharpened blade for a tongue.", "5": "O God, be lifted up above the heavens; may Your glory cover the earth.", "6": "Yet my foes cast a net to catch my feet and bring me to my knees. I am weary from all of this. They dug a pit to snare me but fell into their own trap. [pause]", "7": "My heart is ready, O God; my heart is ready, And I will sing! Yes, I will sing praise!", "8": "Wake up, my glory! Wake up, harp and lyre; I will stir the sleepy dawn with praise!", "9": "I will offer You my thanks, O Lord, before the nations of the world; I will sing of Your greatness no matter where I am.", "10": "For Your amazing mercy ascends far into the heavens; Your truth rises above the clouds.", "11": "O God, be lifted up above the heavens; may Your glory cover the earth."}

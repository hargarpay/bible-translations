{"1": "Eternal One, I come to You in prayer. Hear me out; I plead with You. Lend an ear to my requests. In Your faithfulness and justice, respond to my pleas.", "2": "Be kind and slow to judge Your faithful servant, for compared to You, no one is truly just.", "3": "My adversary has pressed in, drawn closer, threatened my life; he's crushed me, driven me underground. He's forced me to live in the dark; it's as if I joined those who died a long time ago.", "4": "That's why my spirit is growing faint inside me; I have nothing left; my heart is completely empty and desolate.", "5": "And yet I can't forget the days of old, the days I've heard so much about; I fix my mind on all You have done; I ponder the work of Your hands;", "6": "I reach out my hands to You. All that I am aches and yearns for You, like a dry land thirsting for rain. [pause][a]", "7": "Hurry and answer me, O Eternal One, for my spirit is weak, my courage is gone. Do not turn away; let me see Your face; otherwise, I'll die and be like all those who have gone to the grave.", "8": "Make me hear of Your faithful love in the morning, for I trust in You. Teach me how I should walk, for I offer my soul up to You.", "9": "Rescue me from my enemies, Eternal One, for You are my shelter from them.", "10": "Teach me how to do Your will, for You are my God. Allow Your good Spirit to guide me on level ground, to guide me along Your path.", "11": "For the sake of Your name and the good of Your reputation, preserve me, O Eternal One. In Your righteousness, save my life from burden and misery.", "12": "In Your loyal love, silence my enemies for good; destroy all those who take pleasure in my suffering, for I am Your faithful servant!"}

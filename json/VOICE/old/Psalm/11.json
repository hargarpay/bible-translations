{"1": "Psalm 11 is a Davidic psalm expressing trust in the Eternal as a refuge and fortress for those who do what is right. David spent many years struggling first with Saul, then with the neighboring nations, and finally against the rebellion led by his son Absalom. I am already in the soft embrace of the Eternal, so why do you beckon me to leave, saying, \u201cFly like a bird to the mountains.", "2": "Look! The wicked approach with bows bent, sneaking around in the shadows, setting their arrows against their bowstrings to pierce everyone whose heart is pure.", "3": "If the foundations are crumbling, is there hope for the righteous?\u201d", "4": "But the Eternal has not moved; He remains in His holy temple. He sits squarely on His heavenly throne. He observes the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, examining us within and without, exploring every fiber of our beings.", "5": "The Eternal searches the hearts of those who are good, but He despises all those who can't get enough of perversion and violence.", "6": "If you are evil, He will rain hot lava over your head, will fill your cup with burning wind and liquid fire to scorch your insides.", "7": "The Eternal is right in all His ways; He cherishes all that is upright. Those who do what is right in His eyes will see His face."}

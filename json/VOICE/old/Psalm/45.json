{"1": "My heart is bursting with a new song; lyrics to my king erupt like a spring for my king, to my king; my tongue is the pen of a poet, ready and willing.", "2": "Better by far are you than all others, my king; gracious words flow from your lips; indeed, God has blessed you forever.", "3": "Psalm 45 describes the beauty, power, and influence of God's anointed king and may have been composed in honor of a royal wedding. Whether we realize it or not, the overall well-being of a nation is tied directly to its leaders. When the leaders are just and make good decisions, then the welfare of a nation is secure. But when leaders are unjust and make poor decisions, and they pursue personal agendas rather than the public good, then nations suffer. This is why Scripture instructs those of faith to pray for all people everywhere, especially that those in authority would lead the world to dignity and peace (1 Timothy 2:1-3). Psalm 45 celebrates that rare breed, a godly king who pursues truth and justice. It anticipates a joyful union and future children who will one day follow in the steps of their father. May the world witness a new breed of leader, fashioned in the image of this psalm. With your sword at your side, you are glorious, majestic, a mighty warrior.", "4": "Ride on in splendor; ride into battle victorious, for the sake of truth, humility, and justice.

In delight, they enter the palace of the king.", "16": "O king, in this place where your ancestors reigned, you will have sons; you will make them princes throughout all the land.", "17": "I will make sure your name is remembered by all future generations so that the people will offer you thanks and praise now and forever."}

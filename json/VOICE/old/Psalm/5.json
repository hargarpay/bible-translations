{"1": "The various psalms reflect nearly every human emotion: unbridled joy, deep-seated jealousy, seething anger, hope, and depression. These are only a few of the emotions behind the poetry we hear expressed in individual psalms. Feelings and emotions are central to what it means to be human. We cannot escape them nor should we. Psalms invites us to take the emotions we feel and bring them before God. This book models how to come before God in times of sadness, brokenness, and joy. Psalm 5 is a cry for help and a plea for guidance by a person who suffered at the hands of an enemy. It talks about the morning as the time to pray and listen for God to answer. Like many laments, it begins with a cry but ends in confidence. Bend Your ear to me and listen to my words, O Eternal One; hear the deep cry of my heart.", "2": "Listen to my call for help, my King, my True God; to You alone I pray.", "3": "In the morning, O Eternal One, listen for my voice; in the day's first light, I will offer my prayer to You and watch expectantly for Your answer.", "4": "You're not a God who smiles at sin; You cannot abide with evil.", "5": "The proud wither in Your presence; You hate all who pervert and destroy what is good.", "6": "You destroy those with lying lips; the Eternal detests those who murder and deceive.", "7": "Yet I, by Your loving grace, am welcomed into Your house; I will turn my face toward Your holy place and fall on my knees in reverence before You.", "8": "O Eternal One, lead me in the path of Your righteousness amidst those who wish me harm; make Your way clear to me.", "9": "Their words cannot be trusted; they are destructive to their cores. What comes out of their mouths is as foul as a rotting corpse; their words stink of flattery.", "10": "Find them guilty, O True God; let their own devices bring them ruin. Throw them out, and let them drown in the deluge of their sin, for in revolt they brazenly spit in Your face.", "11": "But let those who run to You for safety be glad they did; let them break out in joyful song. May You keep them safe\u2014 their love for You resounding in their hearts.", "12": "You, O Eternal, are the One who lays all good things in the laps of the right-hearted. Your blessings surround them like a shield."}

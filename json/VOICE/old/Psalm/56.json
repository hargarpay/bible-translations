{"1": "Psalm 56 brings to mind the time when David fled from Saul and sought help from the Philistines, his former enemies (1 Samuel 21:10\u201315). In his time of panic and fear, David found courage in trusting God to do what could not be done by human power and ingenuity alone. Show mercy to me, O God, because people are crushing me\u2014 grinding me down like dirt underfoot\u2014all day long. No matter what I do, I can't get myself out from under them.", "2": "My enemies are crushing me, yes all day long, O Highest of High, for many come proud and raise their hands against me.", "3": "When struck by fear, I let go, depending securely upon You alone.", "4": "In God\u2014whose word I praise\u2014 in God I place my trust. I shall not let fear come in, for what can measly men do to me?", "5": "All day long they warp my words; all their thoughts against me are mangled by evil.", "6": "They conspire, then lurk about. They eye my every move, Waiting to steal my very life.", "7": "Because they are wicked through and through, drag them out. In Your just anger, O God, cast them down!", "8": "You have taken note of my journey through life, caught each of my tears in Your bottle. But God, are they not also blots on Your book?", "9": "Then my enemies shall turn back and scatter on the day I call out to You. This I know for certain: God is on my side.", "10": "In God whose word I praise and in the Eternal whose word I praise\u2014", "11": "In God I have placed my trust. I shall not let fear come in, for what can measly men do to me?", "12": "I am bound by Your promise, O God. My life is my offering of thanksgiving to You,", "13": "For You have saved my soul from the darkness of death, steadied my feet from stumbling So I might continue to walk before God, embraced in the light of the living."}

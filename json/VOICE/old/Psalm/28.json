{"1": "Eternal One, I am calling out to You; You are the foundation of my life. Please, don't turn Your ear from me. If You respond to my pleas with silence, I will lose all hope like those silenced by death's grave.", "2": "Listen to my voice. You will hear me begging for Your help With my hands lifted up in prayer, my body turned toward Your holy home.", "3": "This Davidic psalm pleads with God to spare him and repay his enemies. It would be difficult to locate this psalm in any one event. During his life David faced many threats from different enemies; not only were these threats from outside his realm, but some of his most difficult challenges came from inside his own family. I beg You; don't punish me with the most heinous men. They spend their days doing evil. Even when they engage their neighbors in pleasantness, they are scheming against them.", "4": "Pay them back for their deeds; hold them accountable for their malice. Give them what they deserve.", "5": "Because these are people who have no respect for You, O Eternal, they ignore everything You have done. So He will tear them down with His powerful hands; never will they be built again.", "6": "The Eternal should be honored and revered; He has heard my cries for help.", "7": "The Eternal is the source of my strength and the shield that guards me. When I learn to rest and truly trust Him, He sends His help. This is why my heart is singing! I open my mouth to praise Him, and thankfulness rises as song.", "8": "The Eternal gives life and power to all His chosen ones; to His anointed He is a sturdy fortress.", "9": "Rescue Your people, and bring prosperity to Your legacy; may they know You as a shepherd, carrying them at all times."}

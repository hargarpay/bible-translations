Who will lead me into Edom?", "10": "Have You not turned Your back on us, O God? Will You stay away and not accompany our armies, O God?", "11": "Help us against our enemy; we need Your help! It's useless to trust in the hand of man for liberation.", "12": "Only through God can we be successful. It is God alone who will defeat our enemies and bring us victory!"}

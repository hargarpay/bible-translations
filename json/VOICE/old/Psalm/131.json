{"1": "O Eternal One, my heart is not occupied with proud thoughts; my eyes do not look down on others; I don't even begin to get involved in matters too big, matters of faith, state, business, or the many things that defy my ability to understand them.", "2": "Of one thing I am certain: my soul has become calm, quiet, and contented in You. Like a weaned child resting upon his mother, I am quiet. My soul is like this weaned child.", "3": "O Israel, stake your trust completely in the Eternal\u2014 from this very moment and into the vast future."}

{"1": "Psalm 110 may have been written to celebrate the coronation of one of David's sons as king. The Eternal invites the royal son of David to take his rightful place at His right hand, the place of power and authority\u2014not just over Jerusalem but over his enemies as well. But the royal son is to be more than a king, he is to be a priest according the order of that mysterious and enigmatic figure, Melchizedek (Genesis 14:17-24). God promises to give this royal priest-king victory over his enemies as he marches out to war. This psalm is the psalm most quoted by early Christian writers in the New Testament. As they considered the significance of Jesus, they found that this psalm, more than any, expressed their conviction that the risen Jesus now occupies a unique place at God's right hand and will be victorious over His enemies. The Eternal said to my lord, \u201cSit here at My right hand, in the place of honor and power, And I will gather your enemies together, lead them in on hands and knees; you will rest your feet on their backs.\u201d", "2": "The Eternal will extend your reach as you rule from your throne on Zion. You will be out in enemy lands, ruling.", "3": "Your people will come as volunteers that day; they will be a sight to see: on that day, you will lead your army, noble in their holiness. As the new day dawns and dew settles on the grass, your young volunteers will make their way to you.", "4": "The Eternal has sworn an oath and cannot change His mind: \u201cYou are a priest forever\u2014 in the honored order of Melchizedek.\u201d", "5": "The lord is at Your right hand; on the day that his fury comes to its peak, he will crush kings.", "6": "You will see the dead in heaps at the roadside, corpses spread far and wide in valleys and on hillsides. Rulers and military leaders will lie among them without distinction. This will be his judgment on the nations.", "7": "There is a brook along the way. He will stop there and drink; And when he is finished, he will raise his head."}

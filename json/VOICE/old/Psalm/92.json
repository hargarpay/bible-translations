Your thoughts are unfathomable.", "6": "But a weak-minded man can't understand this; foolish people are unable to see", "7": "That evil men sprout like grass and wicked men flourish, only so that they will be doomed forever.", "8": "But You, O Eternal One, are above all, forever.", "9": "As for Your enemies, O Eternal One, their fate is obvious: those who hate You will not survive; those who practice evil will be broken in pieces.", "10": "But You have made me strong as a wild ox, anointed me with the refreshing oil of Your blessing.", "11": "And I have seen with my own eyes my enemies defeated; I have heard with my own ears my attackers cut down.", "12": "Those who are devoted to God will flourish like budding date-palm trees; they will grow strong and tall like cedars in Lebanon.", "13": "Those planted in the house of the Eternal will thrive in the courts of our God.", "14": "They will bear fruit into old age; even in winter, they will be green and full of sap", "15": "To display that the Eternal is righteous.

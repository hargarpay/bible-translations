{"1": "If Psalm 150 is any indication, then the worship of the one True God ought to be full of life and energy. Consider what it must have looked and sounded like in those days: voices lifted, shouting for joy, trumpets blaring, stringed instruments playing, people dancing, pipes humming, tambourines keeping rhythm, cymbals crashing. There are times when worship ought to break out in joy. Is it possible that our worship is too quiet, too reserved, too structured? Praise the Eternal! Praise the True God inside His temple. Praise Him beneath massive skies, under moonlit stars and rising sun.", "2": "Praise Him for His powerful acts, redeeming His people. Praise Him for His greatness that surpasses our time and understanding.", "3-4": "Praise Him with the blast of trumpets high into the heavens, and praise Him with harps and lyres and the rhythm of the tambourines skillfully played by those who love and fear the Eternal. Praise Him with singing and dancing; praise Him with flutes and strings of all kinds!", "5": "Praise Him with crashing cymbals, loud clashing cymbals!", "6": "No one should be left out; Let every man and every beast\u2014 every creature that has the breath of the Lord\u2014praise the Eternal! Praise the Eternal! This doxology not only closes Book Five, but it also closes the entire Book of Psalms. Up until now, the songs in this book have reminded us of all the reasons we should praise God. Some songs have even commanded us to praise Him. But this closing remark takes the command to praise one step further: everything alive\u2014humans, animals, and heaven's creatures\u2014must praise Him. Praise is what God created us to do; it is one of our highest purposes in life. So it is no wonder that the longest book of the Bible is purely devoted to helping us do just that."}

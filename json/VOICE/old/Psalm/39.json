{"1": "As an individual lament, Psalm 39 grieves over the brevity of life. The superscription recalls David's appointment of Jeduthun as one of the tabernacle's leading musicians (1 Chronicles 16:41\u201342). I promised, \u201cI'll be careful on life's journey not to sin with my words; I'll seal my lips when wicked people are around.\u201d", "2": "I kept my mouth shut; I had nothing to say\u2014not even anything good\u2014 which came to grieve me more and more.", "3": "I felt my heart become hot inside me as I thought on these things; a fire ignited and burned. Then I said,", "4": "\u201cEternal One, let me understand my end and how brief my earthly existence is; help me realize my life is fleeting.", "5": "You have determined the length of my days, and my life is nothing compared to You. Even the longest life is only a breath.\u201d [pause][b]", "6": "In truth, each of us journeys through life like a shadow. We busy ourselves accomplishing nothing, piling up assets we can never keep; We can't even know who will end up with those things.", "7": "In light of all this, Lord, what am I really waiting for? You are my hope.", "8": "Keep me from all the wrong I would do; don't let the foolish laugh at me.", "9": "I am quiet; I keep my mouth closed because this has come from You.", "10": "Take Your curse from me; I can't endure Your punishment.", "11": "You discipline us for our sins. Like a moth, You consume everything we treasure; it's evident we are merely a breath. [pause]", "12": "Hear me, O Eternal One; listen to my pleading, and don't ignore my tears Because I am estranged from You\u2014 a wanderer like my fathers before me.", "13": "Look away from me so I might have a chance to recover my joy and smile again before I lay this life down and am no more."}

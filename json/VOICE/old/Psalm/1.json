{"1": "Book One (Psalms 1\u201341) is attributed almost entirely to David; all but four of the psalms (1\u20132; 10; 33) are ascribed to him. In Hebrew Psalm 10 is a continuation of Psalm 9 because it was composed as an acrostic poem. Likewise, many Hebrew manuscripts combine Psalm 33 with 32. Only later are these divided into separate psalms. Psalm 1 sets the stage for the entire collection by explaining that the study of the Word of God is the foundation of a meaningful, prosperous life. God's blessings follow you and await you at every turn: when you don't follow the advice of those who delight in wicked schemes, When you avoid sin's highway, when judgment and sarcasm beckon you, but you refuse.", "2": "For you, the Eternal's Word is your happiness. It is your focus\u2014from dusk to dawn.", "3": "You are like a tree, planted by flowing, cool streams of water that never run dry. Your fruit ripens in its time; your leaves never fade or curl in the summer sun. No matter what you do, you prosper.", "4": "For those who focus on sin, the story is different. They are like the fallen husk of wheat, tossed by an open wind, left deserted and alone.", "5": "In the end, the wicked will fall in judgment; the guilty will be separated from the innocent.", "6": "Their road suddenly will end in death, yet the journey of the righteous has been charted by the Eternal."}

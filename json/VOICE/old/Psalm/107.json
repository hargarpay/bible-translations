{"1": "Book Five (Psalms 107\u2013150) succinctly presents many of the major themes of the previous psalms. It tracks along Israel's history as God's nation, from the united monarchy, through the exile, to the restoration. Psalm 107 is a song of thanksgiving composed by those who survived exile and made their way home. As in Isaiah, the return from exile is described as a new exodus. Three Davidic psalms toward the beginning of Book Five represent the monarchy and recall Israel's golden age. The Songs for the Journey to Worship (Psalm 120\u2013134) are composed for use by God's people as they traveled from their homes up to Zion to worship God at the temple. Representing their time in exile are songs of lament, heartbreaking testimonies to individuals' pain when they are crushed by their enemies and separated from God's blessings. Finally, Book Five concludes the collection by offering praise and thanks to God, for the story of Israel does not end with its exile and separation; rather, it ends in restoration and hope. Those who edited and compiled the Book of Psalms were relieved to be back in the land of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\u2014rebuilding their temple and reestablishing their connection with God.

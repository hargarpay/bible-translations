These well-known Ten Directives or Commandments teach broad principles for godly life and relationships by presenting specific rules meant to be applied more widely, through thoughtful reflection. There are ten because this is the \u201chuman\u201d number in the Bible\u2014people ordinarily have ten fingers and ten toes. But our moral reflection is not supposed to be limited only to the ten areas considered here. The same principles of right relationship illustrated in these areas can be carried into all other areas of human life. The genius of the instruction here is that it's brief enough to be carved on a stone tablet a person can carry or to be remembered when looking at one's fingers or toes, but it has implications that are limitless.

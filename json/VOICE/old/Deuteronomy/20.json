The Eternal your God is with you\u2014the same God who defeated Pharaoh and brought you out of Egypt. ", "2": "As you are approaching the battlefield, your priest will come over to you and address you: ", "3": "\u201cListen, Israel! Today you're going to fight a battle against your enemies. Don't be intimidated by them! Don't be afraid! Don't run away! Don't let them terrify you!

Go back to your house, because if you died in this battle, someone else would dedicate it. ", "6": "Has anyone planted a vineyard but hasn't enjoyed its fruit yet? Go back to your house, because if you died in this battle, someone else would be the first to enjoy its fruit. ", "7": "Has anyone become engaged to a woman but hasn't consummated the marriage? Go back to your house, because if you died in this battle, someone else would take her.\u201d ", "8": "They'll continue, \u201cIs anyone here afraid or intimidated? You can go back home too! We don't want you to make everyone else as scared as you are!\u201d ", "9": "When the officials have finished speaking to the troops, they'll appoint commanders to lead each section of the army.", "10": "When you first approach a city you're going to fight against, shout out, \u201cPeace!\u201d ", "11": "If they shout back, \u201cPeace!\u201d and open their gates to you, then you must let them surrender. Make everyone in the city your slaves, and put them to work for you. ", "12": "But if the city doesn't surrender, if it resists you instead, then lay siege to it.

The Eternal your God has given you these spoils from your enemies.", "15": "This is what you're to do with cities that are a great distance from you that don't belong to the nations living here.

{"1": "Before he died, Moses, the man of God, blessed the people of Israel with this blessing.", "2": "The Lord has \u201ccalled Israel His own\u201d in the way that cities and territories in the ancient world are named after those who have explored, settled, or conquered them. It is understood that the person whose name is attached to a place will have continuing interests there, such as preventing anyone else from taking the crops, oppressing the people, and so forth. The Lord's name is literally \u201cover\u201d the people of Israel, providing shelter and protection. Anyone who wants to harass them has to answer to Him, so His great reputation will keep them safe from marauders. If they are trusting and obedient, they will be protected from spiritual dangers and attacks by the power and reputation of the One who has called them by His own name. Moses: The Eternal came from Mount Sinai: He glowed like the dawn over Mount Seir; He shone like the sun over Mount Paran; He arose in the middle of His chosen ones, gathered in their tens of thousands. The law was a flame in His right hand.[a]", "3": "Truly He loves His people; all Your chosen ones are in Your hand.

He defends himself with his own hands; help him against his enemies!", "8": "About Levi he said, Moses: Your Thummim and Urim belong to your loyal servant, the man you tested at Massah and had a dispute with at Meribah about the water.", "9": "When the Levites carry out the law, they don't give special treatment to their fathers or mothers Or favor their relatives or recognize their children. They obey Your word and keep Your covenant.", "10": "They teach Jacob Your rules; they teach Israel Your law. They set incense before You and offer burnt sacrifices on Your altar.", "11": "Bless Levi with strength, Eternal, and accept the service he offers You. Crush the loins of those who hate him and attack him, so they'll never attack them again!", "12": "About Benjamin he said, Moses: The Eternal's beloved rests safely next to Him, protected all through the day, resting between His shoulders.", "13": "About Joseph he said, Moses: May his land be blessed by the Eternal with the best the sky has to offer\u2014abundant rains\u2014 and with the dew and the waters that lie below the ground.", "14": "May it be blessed with the best the sun can produce and the best crops of each month,", "15": "With the best that grows on the ancient mountains and the everlasting hills,", "16": "With the best the land has to offer when it's filled with good things, And most of all may it be blessed with the favor of the One who appeared in the burning bush. Let all these blessings rest on Joseph's head, on the head of this prince among his brothers.", "17": "He's majestic, like a firstborn bull; he has powerful horns, as does a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, driving them away to the ends of the earth. This is the power of Ephraim's ten thousands, of Manasseh's thousands of troops.", "18": "About Zebulun and Issachar he said, Moses: Rejoice, Zebulun, as you go out to sea, and rejoice, Issachar, in your tents!", "19": "They call peoples to the mountain where they offer right sacrifices; Because they feast on the abundance of the sea, and they profit from the hidden treasures of the sand.", "20": "About Gad he said, Moses: Blessed is the one who expands Gad's territory! He lives there like a lioness, tearing at the arm and the top of the head.", "21": "He chose the best for himself; a commander's portion was hidden for him there, east of the Jordan. He came at the head of the army to help the other tribes conquer their land. He carried out the righteousness of what the Eternal said was to happen, What was right, and carried out His decrees with the rest of Israel.", "22": "About Dan he said, Moses: Dan is a lion's cub, leaping up from Bashan.", "23": "About Naphtali he said, Moses: Naphtali, you're satisfied with favor and filled with the Eternal's blessing.

Who is like you? You're the people the Eternal has saved. He's the shield that protects you and the sword that brings you pride. Your enemies will cringe and surrender before you, and you'll stamp out their high places of worship into the ground."}

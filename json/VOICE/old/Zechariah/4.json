It was time for a fifth vision.", "2": "Heavenly Messenger: 2\u00a0What do you see before you? A fifth vision shows the lamp of God's grace completing what has begun. Zechariah: I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl on top of it and seven oil lamps on it. Each of the seven lamps has a spout, which the wicks lie in to soak up oil as they're burned.

Zechariah: No, lord. I don't.", "6": "Heavenly Messenger (changing the subject): 6\u00a0The Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, has said this to Zerubbabel: \u201cYour strength and prowess will not be enough to finish My temple, but My Spirit will be.\u201d And He says this to those thwarting Zerubbabel's efforts: ", "7": "\u201cWho are you, O mighty mountain of opposition?

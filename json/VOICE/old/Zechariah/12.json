{"1": "This is the message with which the Eternal burdened His prophet concerning Israel\u2014the Eternal One, who began existence by stretching out the sky and founding the earth and forming the spirit deep in man.", "2": "Eternal One: 2\u00a0Watch what I'm about to do! I'm going to make Jerusalem like a cup of strong alcohol to confuse all her neighboring peoples. When they lay siege to Jerusalem, Judah will also be in the fight.[a] ", "3": "On that day, when the enemies begin the attack, I will make Jerusalem a solid stone which cannot be moved; any who try to lift her will only be weighed down and seriously hurt themselves. All the nations on earth will come together to oppose her. ", "4": "And on that day I promise I, the Eternal One, will confound every horse and drive every rider to madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the people of Judah even as I blind every war horse from every enemy nation. ", "5": "Every clan of Judah will see what I am doing and believe, \u201cThe people of Jerusalem cannot be beaten because the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies and their True God, leads them.\u201d[b] ", "6": "On that day, I will make the clans of Judah unstoppable against their enemies, a blazing pot igniting a pile of tinder, a flaming torch consuming dry bundles of wheat. They will devour all the surrounding peoples, those to the right and those to the left, but Jerusalem will remain safe and secure, bustling with citizens. ", "7": "The Eternal will ensure that victory comes first to the tents of Judah, so that the respect due the family of David and the citizens of Jerusalem will not outstrip the respect owed to Judah as a whole. So Jerusalem need not boast, but neither should it fear. ", "8": "When that day comes, the Eternal will protect her citizens as a shield does. He will make the weak who stumble become like David, brave in battle; the royal line of David will be like God, like the Special Messenger of the Eternal One who goes before them in travels and in battle.", "9": "On that day, rest assured, I will set out to destroy all the nations who attack Jerusalem. ", "10": "And I pledge that I will pour out a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy on the family of David and the citizens of Jerusalem. As a result, they will look upon Me whom they pierced,[c] they will grieve over Him as one grieves for an only child, and they will moan and weep for Him as one weeps for a firstborn son. ", "11": "On that day, the grieving in Jerusalem will be as great as the pagans' grieving ritual honoring Hadadrimmon on the plain of Megiddo each year. ", "12-14": "The land itself will seem to mourn as family after family begins to grieve privately: the family of David and their wives, the family of Nathan's descendants and their wives, the family of Levi and their wives, the family of Shimei and their wives, and all the families that are left and their wives. They will all mourn, a profound and private grief."}

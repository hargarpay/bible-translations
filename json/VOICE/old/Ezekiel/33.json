{"1": "The word of the Eternal came to me.", "2": "Eternal One: 2\u00a0Son of man, talk with your fellow exiles, and tell them, \u201cIf I wage war against a country and the people appoint one of their own to be a lookout, ", "3": "and if the lookout sees an army advancing toward the land and blows a trumpet to warn the people, ", "4-5": "and if someone hears the alarm and ignores it, allowing that army to come and capture him; then it is his own fault for not taking appropriate action. His blood will be on his own hands. If he had done something, he could have saved his life and the lives of others. ", "6": "But if the lookout sees an army advancing and does not sound the alarm to warn the people and if some are captured or killed, then their blood will be on the hands of the lookout.\u201d", "7": "Son of man, I have appointed you as a lookout for the nation of Israel. You must listen to what I have to say, then go and pass My warning on to your countrymen. ", "8": "If I have a message for the wicked such as, \u201cWicked one, you are going to die,\u201d and you don't warn him to change his ways, then he will surely die because of his wickedness; but I will hold you responsible for his death.

We are rotting away! How can we live?'\u201d ", "11": "Tell them, \u201cAs I live,\u201d says the Eternal Lord, \u201cI don't enjoy watching the wicked die; I want the wicked to stop doing what they're doing and live! Repent! Turn from your wicked ways. Why would you choose to die instead of live, people of Israel?\u201d", "12": "Son of man, tell your people, \u201cThe righteousness of the righteous won't save him on the day he breaks My law, and the wickedness of the wicked won't cause him to stumble and fall if he turns away from his wickedness. The righteous is not able to depend on his former right actions to save him when he decides to sin. ", "13": "If I assure life to the one who does what is right, but he depends on his reputation for doing right and ends up sinning, then none of his former right actions will be remembered or tallied in his favor. He will surely die because of his sins.

He will escape death. ", "16": "Not one of his former sins will be remembered and tallied against him.

We are many; surely the land has been given to us to own.\u201d ", "25": "Because they continue in their false hope, go give them this message from the Eternal Lord: \u201cYou eat raw meat with blood still in it, you worship idols, and you shed innocent blood. Do you really think you are worthy of owning the land of Israel? ", "26": "You rely on your own strength in battle, you do shocking things, and you all partake in adulterous sex with your neighbors' wives. Do you really think you are worthy of owning the land?\u201d ", "27": "Tell them the Eternal Lord says, \u201cAs surely as I, the Eternal live, those dwelling in the rubble will be killed in battle, those who live out in the open will be fed to wild beasts, and those hiding in fortresses or caves will die of disease.

Her pride in her power will be knocked out from under her, and Israel's mountains will become so desolate that no one will dare to pass through them.

He has a word from the Eternal.\u201d ", "31": "They come to you, just as people flock to see someone famous. My people sit at your feet and seem to hang on your every word, but they never apply those sacred instructions to their own lives. For they act as they speak\u2014with lustful desire\u2014and think only of how they'll make a profit. ", "32": "To them you are nothing more than a gifted singer of lustful songs, a teller of tales, a master of instruments! They hear what you say but fail to put any of it into practice. ", "33": "But when the messages you've given them actually come true\u2014and I assure you, everything you tell them is going to come true\u2014they will realize a true prophet has been among them."}

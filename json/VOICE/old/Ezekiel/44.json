I fell and buried my face in the ground.", "5": "Eternal One: 5\u00a0Son of man, look closely and listen carefully. Pay attention to all I am about to tell you. I am going to lay out the rules and regulations for My temple. Take note of those having to do with entering the temple and exiting the sanctuary.

", "7": "Not only do you engage in shocking behaviors, but you have the audacity to bring the uncircumcised\u2014in heart and in flesh\u2014into My sanctuary, knowing they'll contaminate it. You allowed them in even as you offered My food, the fat and blood of the sacrifices, on the altar. In doing so, you shattered our pact.

This I, the Eternal One, promise. ", "13": "They are not allowed to approach Me as the priests do. In fact, they aren't permitted anywhere near Me or any of My sacred things and holy offerings.

{"1": "Eternal One: Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a straight razor to shave your head and beard. Then take scales and divide the hair up by weight into thirds. ", "2": "When the days prescribed for the siege are over, take a third of the hair and burn it in a fire within the city walls. Then take another third and thrash it with a sword all around the city. Scatter the last third of the hair to the wind. Then I will draw My sword and chase them! ", "3": "Keep a few strands of the hairs and tie them to the edges of your garment. ", "4": "Take some of these extra strands of hair and fling them into the fire to burn them up. From there, a fire will spread to the whole house of Israel.", "5": "This is what the Eternal One says: Eternal One: This stands for Jerusalem. I have placed her at the center of all nations, with countries surrounding her. ", "6": "Yet she has defied My teachings and acted more wickedly than any of the other nations living around her; she has rejected My decrees and ignored My guidance. ", "7": "This is what I, the Eternal Lord, have to say: You have been more rebellious toward My guidance and decrees than any other nation, choosing not to live even under the ethical and moral standards of other nations, and certainly not under My laws. ", "8": "Therefore, I say, I am no longer your ally, Jerusalem. I am your enemy! I am going to punish you in front of all nations. ", "9": "Because of your shocking actions, I am going to do something I have never done before and will never do again: ", "10": "The day will come when fathers will devour their sons, and sons will feed off their fathers' flesh. This is how I will punish you and scatter the few of you who survive to the wind.", "11": "When a powerful army surrounds the walls of a city, it cuts off the people's access to their fields, animals, and water sources. If the siege lasts long enough, death is inevitable for those inside the city walls. As the bodies pile up and hunger becomes unbearable, cannibalism may be the only way to stay alive. There is something horrid about cannibalism. The notion that parents may be reduced to eating their children disrupts every natural impulse a parent has. But Scripture teaches that those who break God's law and violate His holiness may be cursed with this punishment (Leviticus 26:29). Eternal One: 11\u00a0Consequently, as surely as I live, because you have degraded My holy sanctuary with all your detestable images and shocking actions, I will leave you. I will shed no tears of compassion over you. ", "12": "One-third of your people will suffer during the siege, starving to death or dying from disease within the city walls. Another third of you will die in battles outside of the city walls as they try to escape. The remaining third will be scattered to the winds, and I will draw My sword and chase after them.", "13": "After this My anger will subside. I will not be satisfied until I have unleashed My fiery judgment on them. Then they will know that I, the Eternal One, am the one who commanded all of this, for I jealously desire their devotion. ", "14": "When I am finished with you, your nation will lie in ruins. You will be mocked and ridiculed by the nations around you and those who pass by. ", "15": "You will become a byword to the nations, a warning to the world as they watch your horrific downfall when I punish you with anger, with fury, and with fiery judgment. I, the Eternal One, have spoken. ", "16": "When I shoot My deadly arrows of famine and war at you, I will shoot to kill. I'll curse you with more famine and cut off your food supply. ", "17": "And when the famine has run its course, I will send savage beasts to attack you and eat the rest of your children. Plague, disease, murder, and bloodshed will pass through your land as I wage war against you! I, the Eternal, have spoken."}

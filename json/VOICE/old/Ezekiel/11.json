{"1": "Then the Spirit lifted me up and transported me to the eastern gate of the Eternal's house. I saw 25 men standing at the entrance of the gate. I recognized 2 leaders among them\u2014Jaazaniah (Azur's son) and Pelatiah (Benaiah's son).", "2": "Eternal One: 2\u00a0Son of man, these are the ones concocting evil plans and pushing wicked schemes on the city. ", "3": "They say, \u201cThis is not a good time to build houses. The city of Jerusalem is like an iron pot, and we are the meat inside it.\u201d ", "4": "Therefore, prophesy against them, son of man; speak My message to them.", "5": "Then the Spirit of the Eternal came over me and said to me: Eternal One: Tell them this is what the Eternal has to say: Those may be your secret thoughts, people of Israel, but I know what's going on in your minds. ", "6": "You have murdered masses of people in this city, and you have filled the streets with dead bodies. ", "7": "The corpses you have scattered in the streets are the meat, and this city is the pot; but I will make sure you are taken out of this city. ", "8": "Since you fear war, that is exactly what I will bring against you. I, the Eternal Lord, declare that. ", "9": "After I drive you out of the city, I will give you over to the control of foreigners, and they will punish you! ", "10": "You will die in battle, and My judgment will fall on you as you flee for the border of Israel. Then you will know I am the Eternal One. ", "11": "This city will not be a protective pot for you, and you certainly won't be the meat tended within it. I will execute My judgment against you all the way to the border of Israel, ", "12": "and you will know I am the Eternal One. You have been careless with My laws and disregarded My instructions, mindlessly conforming to the standards of the nations around you.", "13": "As I was prophesying, Pelatiah (Benaiah's son) died. Then I fell to the ground, face down, and exclaimed in a loud voice, \u201cHear me, Eternal Lord! Will You do away completely with the remnant of Israel?\u201d", "14": "At this, the word of the Eternal came to me:", "15": "Eternal One: 15\u00a0Son of man, your people in exile\u2014your own relatives, your countrymen, and the whole nation of Israel\u2014are the ones the citizens of Jerusalem have disparaged, saying, \u201cThey have been taken far away from the Eternal. This land is ours now. It has been given to us to keep.\u201d But they are mistaken. It is those in exile whom I will redeem.", "16": "Give the citizens of Jerusalem My message. \u201cTell them that I, the Eternal Lord, drove them far away from My temple and scattered them among other countries, but I have still been a sanctuary for them during this time in those other lands where they have gone.\u201d ", "17": "Then deliver My message to the exiles. \u201cTell them that I, the Eternal Lord, will gather you and reassemble you from the places where I scattered you, and I will return your inheritance\u2014the land of Israel\u2014to you because you are My true children.\u201d", "18": "Ezekiel may seem like a prophet of doom and gloom, but like most prophets he sees beyond judgment to God's restoration of His people. The only hope for the Judean exiles is that they be given a new heart and spirit from their Creator. The prophet receives this optimistic message again and again. Although divine punishment is severe, divine rescue will eclipse any tragedy because God will recreate His people. Eternal One: 18\u00a0When they return home, they will demolish all the disgusting idols and remove all the shocking images from the land. ", "19": "I will give them a new will\u2014an undivided heart\u2014and plant a new spirit within them; I will remove their cold, stony heart and replace it with a warm heart of flesh. ", "20": "Then they will follow My commands and uphold My laws and actually do as I say. They will be My people, and I will be their God. ", "21": "As for those who remain dedicated to their disgusting idols and shocking images, the very things they have done will be brought down upon them as judgment. So said the Eternal Lord.", "22": "Then the winged guardians[a] stretched out their wings, the wheels moved along with them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them. ", "23": "The glory of the Eternal arose from the center of the city and began to move east, stopping momentarily above the mountain to its east called the Mount of Olives. ", "24": "The Spirit snatched me up and brought me in a vision given by God's Spirit to the exiles in the Chaldea. Then the vision left me, ", "25": "and I told the exiles everything the Eternal had revealed to me."}

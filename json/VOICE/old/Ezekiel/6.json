{"1": "The word of the Eternal came to me about Israel's coming destruction.", "2": "The personification of the mountains and land of Israel emphasizes the severity of the situation. The actions of God's wayward people not only defile them\u2014they defile the land. Eternal One: 2\u00a0Son of man, turn your gaze to the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them. ", "3": "Tell the mountains of Israel to listen to the word of the Eternal Lord. I have a message for the high mountains and green hills, riverbeds and lush, fertile valleys: I am bringing the weapons of war against you, and I will demolish the shrines on your heights. ", "4": "Your sacrificial altars will be ruined, your incense altars smashed. I will throw down your slain before your lifeless idols. ", "5": "I will lay the remains of the dead Israelites in front of your lifeless idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars so the place is contaminated with death. ", "6": "In every place you live, the towns will be left in ruins and the high places will be rubble so that every place becomes a desolate wasteland. Your sacrificial altars will be destroyed and abandoned, your idols crushed and flattened, your incense altars smashed, and all you have created will be wiped out. ", "7": "Your towns will be full of corpses. Then you will know I am the Eternal One.", "8": "But I will spare a few of you, and those who escape My punishing war will be scattered throughout other lands and nations. ", "9": "In the nations where they have been taken as exiles, those who have been spared will remember Me\u2014how I have been wounded by their promiscuous hearts that turned away from Me, how I have been hurt by their wandering eyes that desired lifeless idols. They will hate themselves for the evil they have done and for their detestable actions. ", "10": "Then they will know I am the Eternal One. They will understand I did not utter empty threats when I said I would bring disaster on them.", "11": "Here is what I, the Eternal Lord, have to say: Clap your hands together, stomp your feet, and shout, How awful it will be for the people of Israel because of all the evil, shocking actions they have committed. They will be slain. War, famine, and disease will fall upon them! ", "12": "Those who are far away will die of disease; those who are near will fall in battle; those who are spared will die of starvation. This is how I will spend My wrath on them. ", "13": "After all the destruction, you will know I am the Eternal\u2014when the rotting corpses of their slain are spread out among their fallen altars and shattered idols, on every green hill and high mountaintop, beneath every green tree and leafy oak, any place they offered sweet incense to their breathless idols. ", "14": "Wherever they live, I will stretch out My hand against them and make their land an empty wasteland, from the wilderness to Diblah. Then they will know I am the Eternal One."}

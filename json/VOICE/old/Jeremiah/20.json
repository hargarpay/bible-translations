You will see those close to you die in battle against the enemy. I will give all of Judah over to the king of Babylon, who will make them either casualties of war or prisoners of war. ", "5": "I will also give the wealth of Jerusalem over as plunder to this enemy. The resources and treasures of this city and Judah's kings will be taken and carted off to Babylon. ", "6": "And you Pashhur, along with your entire household, will be taken to Babylon and become exiles. You and your friends who have heard your lies will never see home again; you will all die in exile in Babylon and be buried there.\u201d", "7": "O Eternal, You deceived me into being Your prophet, and I went along and allowed it to happen!

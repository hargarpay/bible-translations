On that sad summer day, Jerusalem finally fell when the Chaldeans broke through the city wall. ", "3": "All the officials designated by Babylon's king to exercise his authority entered the city and sat at the middle gate. These included Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim (who was a chief officer), Nergal-sar-ezer (a high official), and all the other officials sent by the king of Babylon.", "4": "When King Zedekiah of Judah and his troops saw the Babylonians break through the wall on the north side of the city, they fled under the cloak of darkness.

", "5": "But the Chaldean army discovered this and chased after Zedekiah, capturing him on the plains of Jericho. They took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who had set up his command post at Riblah in the old Aramean city of Hamath. It was here that the dreaded king pronounced judgment on Zedekiah for rebelling against him. ", "6": "Zedekiah was forced to watch as his own sons and the nobles of Judah were slaughtered right in front of him. ", "7": "This was the very last thing he saw, because Nebuchadnezzar then blinded the eyes of Zedekiah. This blinded and humiliated king was then placed in bronze shackles and carried off to Babylon.

", "9": "Those who were left in the city, along with those who had previously surrendered, were then deported to Babylon by Nebuzaradan (captain of the imperial guard). ", "10": "But he left some of the poorest people in Judah and gave them vineyards and fields to care for.", "11": "Removing only the rich and influential citizens, who might cause them trouble, is a political strategy.

Very soon I will bring disaster not prosperity on Jerusalem and her citizens as I warned through Jeremiah. And you, Ebed-melech, will see all this happen with your own eyes.

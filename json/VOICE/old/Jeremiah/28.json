{"1": "One day in the fifth month of the same year (this was early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, the fourth year), a prophet from Gibeon named Hananiah (son of Azzur) contradicted me in front of the priests and all the people who had come to worship in the temple of the Eternal.", "2": "Hananiah: 2\u00a0This is what the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies and God of Israel, says: \u201cI will break the yoke Babylon's king has placed upon you. ", "3": "Within two years, I will bring back the items King Nebuchadnezzar took from My temple and carried away to Babylon. ", "4": "I will also bring back Jeconiah (son of Jehoiakim), king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah taken with him to Babylon. This is what I, the Eternal One, declare: 'I will break the yoke that Babylon's king has placed upon you!'\u201d", "5": "Then Jeremiah the prophet addressed Hananiah the prophet in front of the priests and all the people who had come to worship in the temple of the Eternal.", "6": "Jeremiah: 6\u00a0May it be so! May the Eternal do just as you said. May He confirm that your prophecy is true by bringing back the items stolen from the temple. Better yet, may He bring all of the exiles home from Babylon.", "7": "But now hear what I have to say to you and to all these people listening to us: ", "8": "Long before either of us was here, in the days of old, there were prophets who spoke strong words against many nations and kingdoms. They, too, predicted war, famine, and disease; and they have been proven right. ", "9": "Now, as for the prophet who prophecies peace, how are we to know whether he is a true prophet sent by the Eternal? Only when that prediction comes true.", "10": "At this point, the prophet Hananiah grabbed the yoke from around Jeremiah's neck and broke it. ", "11": "He then turned to the people and said: Hananiah: This is what the Eternal says: \u201cThis is how I will break the yoke King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon forced you and all the nations to wear. I will remove it from your neck within two years.\u201d And with that, the prophet Jeremiah walked away.", "12": "Not long after Hananiah had broken the yoke off Jeremiah's neck, the word of the Eternal came to Jeremiah.", "13": "Eternal One: 13\u00a0Go to Hananiah and tell him, \u201cThis is what the Eternal says: 'You may have broken a wooden yoke, but now you will get a yoke of iron that you could never break.' ", "14": "For this is what the Eternal, the Commander of heavenly armies and God of Israel, declares: 'I have put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations, and they will serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Even the wild animals of the field will obey Him.'\u201d", "15": "Jeremiah (to Hananiah): 15\u00a0Listen, Hananiah! The Eternal has not sent you, but still the people of this nation have believed your lies. ", "16": "So the Eternal now says this to you: \u201cPay attention. I am about to wipe you from the face of the earth. Because you have stirred up rebellion against Me with your words, you will die this year.\u201d", "17": "Later that year, in the seventh month, Hananiah the prophet died."}

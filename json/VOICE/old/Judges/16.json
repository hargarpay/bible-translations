{"1": "When Samson went to Gaza, he saw a prostitute there who pleased him, so he went in to be with her. ", "2": "Word went out to the men of Gaza that Samson had arrived. So they surrounded the house and waited quietly for him at the city gate, thinking, \u201cWhen morning comes, we will strike him down.\u201d ", "3": "But Samson fooled the men of Gaza: he stayed with the prostitute only until midnight. Then he rose from the bed, took hold of the closed city gates, and pulled them, still barred, and the posts that held them, out of the ground. Then he hoisted them onto his shoulders and carried them up onto the hill in front of Hebron.", "4": "After this he fell in love with Delilah, a woman from the valley of Sorek. ", "5": "The rulers of the Philistines came to her with a plan. Philistine Rulers: If you can charm him into giving you the secret of his great strength so that we can overpower and capture him, each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.", "6": "Delilah agreed. On one of their visits, she questioned him. Delilah (to Samson): What makes you so strong? How could anyone bind you and control you?", "7": "Samson: 7\u00a0If you were to bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not dried yet, I would be weak and no different from any other man.", "8": "It seems as though Samson is toying with Delilah in his answer. The Philistine rulers brought Delilah seven fresh bowstrings. As Samson slept, she bound him with them. ", "9": "When the warriors had taken their places in the inner chamber, Delilah called out to him. Delilah: Wake up, Samson! The Philistines are attacking! But he snapped the bowstrings the way a thread snaps when it is touched by a flame and fended off the attackers. So the secret of his strength remained hidden.", "10": "Delilah (to Samson): 10\u00a0You're making fun of me now. You haven't told me the truth. Please tell me: how could I bind you and take away your strength?", "11": "Samson: 11\u00a0If you were to bind me with new ropes that have never been used, I would be weak and no different from any other man.", "12": "Using new ropes Delilah bound Samson as he slept. When the warriors had taken their places in the inner chamber, Delilah called out to him. Delilah: Wake up, Samson! The Philistines are attacking! But he snapped the ropes like a thread and fended off the attackers. So the secret of his strength remained hidden.", "13": "Delilah (to Samson): 13\u00a0You just go on making fun of me. You haven't told me the truth. Please tell me: how could I bind you and take away your strength? Samson: If you were to weave my seven locks of hair into the loom's web and make it tight with a pin, I would be weak and no different from any other man.", "14": "While he slept, Delilah wove his seven locks of hair into the loom's web and tightened it with the weaver's comb. When the warriors had taken their places in the inner chamber, Delilah called out, Delilah: Wake up, Samson! The Philistines are attacking! But Samson woke up and easily pulled out the comb from the loom and his hair from the web and fended off the attackers. So the secret of his strength remained hidden.", "15": "Delilah: 15\u00a0How can you say you love me when your actions prove your heart is somewhere else? Three times now you've lied to me and haven't told me why you have such great strength.", "16": "She continued to ask him, day after day, always nagging; and finally he was tired of it, so tired he couldn't stand to hear it any longer. ", "17": "Samson told her the truth. Samson: I have been a Nazirite, set aside to God since I was in my mother's womb, and my hair has never been cut. If my head were shaved, my strength would vanish. I would be weak and no different from any other man.", "18": "Delilah at last saw that he was telling her the truth. She sent for the rulers of the Philistines and told them, \u201cThis time he has told me his whole secret.\u201d So the lords of the Philistines came, bringing the money they had promised to pay her for betraying Samson.", "19": "Samson's bride and Delilah are both presented as unfaithful and deceitful, and Delilah's name has become synonymous with any wily and seductive woman who wants to ruin a man. Although these betrayals are part of God's purpose, some readers have used these particular stories to put down all women. It's good to remind ourselves that earlier in the Book of Judges God uses Deborah and Jael, brave and strong women, to achieve His purpose. The characters in the story of God's people\u2014men and women alike\u2014are sometimes good and sometimes evil. Even a Levite, someone set aside to the priesthood of God, can behave with selfishness and cowardice. She helped Samson fall asleep in her lap and called in a man to shave off the seven locks of Samson's hair. Immediately his strength left him. ", "20": "This time she called to him. Delilah: Wake up, Samson! The Philistines are attacking! His strength was gone. Samson woke up and thought he would shake himself free, as he had before, because he did not know that the Spirit of the Eternal had left him.", "21": "But this time the Philistines seized and held him. They put out his eyes. Then they took him to Gaza, where they bound him with bronze chains and put him to work grinding grain in the prison mill. ", "22": "But while he was there, his hair began to grow back.", "23": "One day, the rulers of the Philistines gathered for a festival of sacrifice to their god Dagon to celebrate Dagon giving their great enemy, Samson, into their control. ", "24": "Whenever the Philistines saw Samson trudging in the mill, it made them joyful. Philistines: Our god has given us the great ravager of our land, Samson, who killed so many of us.", "25": "And during the festival when they were feeling merry, they called for Samson. Philistine Mob: Bring Samson out, and have him entertain us. So Samson was led out of the prison and brought before all the people gathered for the festival. They displayed him between the pillars for their entertainment, ", "26": "and Samson spoke to the boy leading him. Samson: Put me between the main pillars, the ones that hold up the roof, so that I can lean against them.", "27": "For this occasion the building was full of people\u2014men and women and all the rulers of the Philistines were there. About 3,000 people stood on the roof watching as Samson leaned against the pillars. The crowd watched and waited with anticipation.", "28": "Samson (crying out to the Lord): 28\u00a0Lord, Eternal One, remember me and fill me with strength this one last time, O True God, so that with this last act of revenge I can pay back the Philistines for the loss of my sight.", "29": "He took hold of the two main pillars of the building, the ones supporting the roof, and he leaned hard against them, his right hand on one, his left hand on the other.", "30": "Samson: 30\u00a0Let me die here with the Philistines. He pushed with all his might. The pillars gave; the building collapsed on the rulers and all the Philistine people who were in it. The number of enemies that he killed at his death was greater than the number of Philistines he had killed during the rest of his life.", "31": "Then his brothers and the rest of his family came down from the hill country and took his body back up to be buried between the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial ground of his father Manoah. Samson had been judge of Israel for 20 years."}

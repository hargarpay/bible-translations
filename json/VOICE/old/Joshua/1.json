After his death, the Eternal singled out Joshua, the son of Nun, who had walked at the right hand of Moses during the wilderness wanderings.", "2": "Eternal One (to Joshua): 2\u00a0Since My servant Moses is now dead, you and the Israelites must prepare to cross over the Jordan River to enter the land I have given you. ", "3": "I will give you every place you walk, wherever your feet touch, just as I promised Moses.[a] ", "4": "From the southern deserts to the northern mountains in Lebanon, from the great Euphrates River in the east\u2014including all the land of the Hittites\u2014to the great Mediterranean Sea in the west, all of it is yours. ", "5": "No one will be able to oppose you for as long as you live. I will be with you just as I was with Moses, and I will never fail or abandon you.", "6": "So be strong and courageous, for you will lead this people as they acquire and then divide the land I promised to their ancestors.

Never be afraid or discouraged because I am your God, the Eternal One, and I will remain with you wherever you go.", "10": "Joshua is following in the footsteps of the famous prophet, Moses, who led the people of Israel out of Egypt. It is a journey that will lead them where God wants them\u2014in the lands He has long ago promised to the descendants of the patriarch Abraham. Although mighty people occupy the lands, God tells the Israelites that the land will be theirs, if they only believe. Joshua is reminded often enough of the wanderings in the desert following Moses. It's an intimidating thing to follow a legend, but the charge God gives Joshua also gives him what he needs to succeed: Be strong and courageous, and keep the words of God always in front of you. If you do those things, then you can't go wrong. And if you do those things, God says He will be with you. When Joshua had heard God's commands, he gathered the leaders of the people of Israel and gave them their instructions.", "11": "Joshua (to all the leaders): 11\u00a0Go through the camp and tell your people, \u201cGather whatever you need because in three days you will pass over the Jordan into the land the Eternal One, your God, has given you to possess.

Fight with them until they, too, occupy the land your God, the Eternal One, is setting aside for them. Then you may cross the Jordan again and return to this land that Moses, His servant, has given you east of the Jordan and live here.", "16": "Leaders (agreeing): 16\u00a0We will do all you have commanded, and we will go wherever you send us.

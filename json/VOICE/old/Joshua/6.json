{"1": "The citizens of Jericho had barricaded themselves behind its high walls because of the Israelite forces. No one could get in or out.", "2": "Eternal One (to Joshua): 2\u00a0I have given Jericho, its king, and all its soldiers into your hands. ", "3": "Every day for the next six days, you will march once around the city walls with all your fighting force. ", "4": "Seven priests will go in front of the covenant chest, each carrying a trumpet made from a ram's horn. On the seventh day, you will march around the city walls seven times, and the priests will blow their trumpets. ", "5": "When they play a long final blast, then all the people will give a mighty shout. The city walls will collapse in front of you, and all the Israelites will charge in and take the city.", "6": "So Joshua, the son of Nun, summoned the priests and instructed them. Joshua: Take up the chest and have seven priests, each carrying a ram's horn trumpet, march in front of the covenant chest of the Eternal.", "7": "Then he gave orders to the people. Joshua: March around the city with the fighting men marching ahead of the chest of the Eternal.", "8-9": "So they all proceeded as Joshua had commanded them. The fighting men led the way; the seven priests marched after them, blowing their horns continually in front of the covenant chest of the Eternal, and the rear guard followed behind.", "10": "Joshua gave the Israelites very strict instructions. Joshua: Don't yell or shout. Don't let your voice be heard until the day I tell you. And then I want you to shout with all your might.", "11": "So they circled the city once, carrying the covenant chest of the Eternal, and that night they returned to their camp. ", "12": "The next morning, Joshua rose early, the priests carried the chest of the Eternal, ", "13-14": "and they all marched around the city in exactly the same order as they had the day before: the armed men, seven trumpeting priests, the chest of the Eternal, and the rear guard, all making one complete circuit around the city with its great walls. That night they returned to their camp, and the next four days proceeded just like the first two.", "15": "But on the seventh day, they rose with the sun and the procession marched around the city walls seven times; that was the only day they made seven circuits around the city walls. ", "16": "After the seventh and final circuit, when the priests had raised a mighty noise on their trumpets, Joshua turned to the people. Joshua: Shout! Shout! For the Eternal One has given you the city! ", "17": "The city and all who are in it will be destroyed completely as an offering to Him, except for the prostitute Rahab and those who are with her in her house. Her life will be spared as a reward for sheltering our two spies.", "18": "Be sure to stay away from these things that He has devoted to complete destruction so that you won't be tempted to pick something up and carry it away. Anyone who disobeys God in this matter will bring destruction on all of us.", "19": "Any silver or gold, any bronze or iron vessels should not be burned; instead, they should be set aside for the Eternal's treasury.", "20": "Then the people shouted, and the trumpets blasted. The noise of the voices and trumpets rose higher and higher, and the thick walls of Jericho collapsed, just as God had promised. When the wall fell before them, they rushed straight ahead and took the city, ", "21": "killing everyone\u2014all the men and women and children, all the cattle and livestock\u2014with their swords.", "22": "Joshua (to the two spies): 22\u00a0Go back to the house of the prostitute, and bring her out with all of those who have hidden there so that you can keep your word.", "23": "So they set off through the destruction, found Rahab's house, and brought her and all she had\u2014father and mother, brothers and sisters, and all her relatives\u2014out of the fallen city to a place outside the camp of Israel.", "24": "So Jericho was destroyed completely, burned to the ground except for the precious metals and iron and bronze vessels that were put into the treasury of the Eternal's house. ", "25": "But Joshua spared the life of Rahab the prostitute, all her family, and all she had because she was faithful to the spies he had sent, and she lived among the Israelites from that day on.", "26": "When the city lay in smoke and ashes, Joshua pronounced a curse. Joshua: May the Eternal curse anyone who ever rebuilds this city, this Jericho! If he lays new foundations, it will be over the grave of his firstborn; if he raises new gates, it will be to contain the corpse of his youngest!", "27": "The Eternal One had helped Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land."}

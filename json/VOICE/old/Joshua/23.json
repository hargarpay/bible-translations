After Israel had taken possession of their inheritances and the Eternal had given them peace for many years and when Joshua was very old, ", "2": "he summoned all of Israel, their judges and officers and leaders. Joshua: I am an old man. ", "3": "You have seen everything the Eternal One, your True God, did to these nations for you; the Eternal One, your True God, fought for you. ", "4": "I have allotted as your tribes' inheritances the territories of those people who still remain, as well as all the nations I captured from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean. ", "5": "The Eternal your God will push them out of their lands and out of your sight and you will live in their lands, just as He promised you. ", "6": "So be firm and unswerving, observing all that is written in the law of Moses without deviation.

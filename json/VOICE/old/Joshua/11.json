{"1": "When King Jabin of Hazor heard what Israel had done to the central and southern cities of Canaan, he sent messengers to King Jobab of Madon, the king of Shimron, the king of Achshaph, ", "2": "and the kings who were in the northern hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west; ", "3": "to the Canaanites in the east and the west; the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country; the Hivites in the foothills of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpeh, and to all those who could still fight the invaders. ", "4": "They banded together and came out to fight\u2014so many warriors that you could no more count them than you could count the grains of sand on a beach\u2014and leading them was a vast number of horses and chariots. ", "5": "All of these kings pooled their forces, and they camped together by the waters of Merom, ready to make war on Israel.", "6": "Eternal One (to Joshua): 6\u00a0Don't be afraid of them. By this time tomorrow, I will have given all of them as dead bodies into your hands. You will disable their horses and burn their chariots.", "7": "So Joshua's army came upon them suddenly where they camped beside the waters of Merom and attacked them, ", "8": "and the Eternal delivered this vast army to Israel. They pursued the retreating soldiers as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and to the east as far as the valley of Mizpeh until no one was left to fight. ", "9": "And Joshua cut the hamstrings of all their horses and burned all the chariots, as the Eternal had commanded.", "10": "Then Joshua turned against Hazor, which had been the leader of all these armies, and destroyed their king ", "11": "and every living, moving, breathing creature within, and burned the city. ", "12": "Joshua moved through each of these cities destroying their armies and putting them all to the sword, including their king, and utterly destroying them as Moses, the servant of the Eternal, had commanded. ", "13": "But Hazor was the only city Joshua burned to the ground of the cities built up on hills. ", "14": "The Israelites looted all of these towns, taking the goods and the livestock as their own but killing all of the inhabitants with the sword, leaving none alive. ", "15": "The Eternal had commanded His servant, Moses, and Moses had commanded Joshua; so Joshua did everything he had been told until nothing the Eternal had commanded Moses was left undone.", "16": "So Joshua took all of that land: the hill country, the Negev, and the land of Goshen. He conquered the lowland regions, the Arabah, and central hill country with its foothills, ", "17-18": "from Mount Halak, near Seir, to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. Wherever he went in that land\u2014and it was a long war\u2014he captured their kings and defeated them and executed them. ", "19": "The only people who were not destroyed in battle were the Gibeonites (Hivites) who had made peace with the Israelites. ", "20": "The Eternal boosted the courage of Israel's enemies so they would come out and oppose Israel as nations receiving no favor but only to be utterly destroyed, just as the Eternal had commanded Moses.", "21": "Finally Joshua went to war with the Anakim and wiped them from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hills of Judah in the south, and from the hills of Israel further north. Joshua's army utterly destroyed them, their kings, their armies, and their cities, ", "22": "until not one of the Anakim was left alive in the land of the Israelites. Only a few remained in the Philistine coastal cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.", "23": "So this is how Joshua took the whole land, just as the Eternal had commanded Moses in the land beyond the Jordan; Joshua allotted it as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and at last the land was quiet from wars."}

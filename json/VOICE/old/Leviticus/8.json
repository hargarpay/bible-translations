We do know the high priest used them to ascertain God's will on difficult questions (see Numbers 27:21; 1 Samuel 14:41\u201342). Moses then put the turban on Aaron's head and fastened a golden medallion, a holy crown, to the front of it.

He did exactly as the Eternal commanded.", "14": "This consecration is of Aaron and his sons along with the enclosed part of the congregation tent, the sanctuary, and their objects. They are all set apart for God's special purpose. Moses brought the bull for the purification offering for sin and had Aaron and his sons place their hands on the bull's head. ", "15": "After the bull was slaughtered, Moses dipped his finger in its blood and rubbed it on the altar horns, purifying the altar. Moses then poured the remaining blood at the base of the altar. This is how Moses consecrated the altar and covered over any impurity it possessed. ", "16": "Moses also removed the fat from around the organs, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat around them, and offered it all up as smoke on the altar. ", "17": "As for the rest of the bull\u2014its skin, its meat, and its excrement\u2014he took and burned it outside the camp.

", "21": "After rinsing off the organs and legs with water\u2014in order to remove any impurities\u2014he took everything that was left of the ram and offered it up on the altar. The smoke of the burnt offering rose and became a pleasant aroma, a fire-offering to the Eternal One. Moses did all this exactly as the Eternal commanded.", "22": "Then Moses prepared the second ram, the ordination ram. He had Aaron and his sons place their hands on its head. ", "23": "After Moses slaughtered it, he put some of the ram's blood on Aaron's right ear lobe, on his right thumb, and on his right big toe.

He put them on the fat and on the right thigh. ", "27": "Then he placed it all in the hands of Aaron and his sons, who raised them to the Eternal One as a wave offering. ", "28": "Moses then took it all back from Aaron and his sons and offered it on the altar along with the burnt offering. The smoke of the ordination offering rose and became a pleasant aroma, a fire-offering to the Eternal. ", "29": "Moses also lifted up the breast of the ram as a wave offering to the Eternal. The breast served as Moses' portion of the ordination offering as the Eternal had commanded.", "30": "Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments. He did the same on Aaron's sons and their garments. This is how he consecrated Aaron and his priestly garments, as well as his sons and their garments.", "31": "Moses (to Aaron and his sons): 31\u00a0Boil the meat at the entrance to the congregation tent, and feast on it together with bread from the basket of the ordination offering, in accordance with the instructions I gave: \u201cAaron and his sons may eat it.\u201d ", "32": "Burn the rest of the meat and bread in the fire.

", "35": "Stay here at the entrance of the congregation tent all day and all night for the seven days. Do whatever the Eternal requires, or else you will die, for this is the command He has given me.", "36": "So Aaron and his sons honored the Eternal One's instructions, which He commanded through Moses."}

{"1": "In our world, these rules are hard to understand. But remember, it has only been in recent years that Western society has shown concern for people with disabilities. In much of the world today, people who suffer deformities or disabilities are treated differently\u2014as somehow imperfect. Less than a century ago, \u201clittle people\u201d and other \u201cfreaks of nature\u201d were in circuses for the amusement of the rest of us. So we must be careful not to judge people who lived 3,000 years ago by our modern standards and sensibilities. That would not be fair. The logic is clear: just as the sacrifice must be pure and unblemished, so must the priest who offers the sacrifice be whole in body. Disabled priests are mercifully included in God's provision because they are permitted to eat the consecrated bread. The Eternal One spoke to Moses.", "2": "Eternal One: 2\u00a0Instruct Aaron and his sons to be cautious with the sacred food offerings the Israelites bring\u2014the ones they give in My honor so that they do not desecrate My sacred name and ruin My reputation.

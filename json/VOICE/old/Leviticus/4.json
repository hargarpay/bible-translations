{"1": "The Eternal One then spoke to Moses.", "2": "Eternal One: 2\u00a0Moses, go, talk with the Israelites, and tell them that if someone unwittingly commits a sin that violates any of the directives I have given, this is what you should do.", "3": "Sin is serious business; it destroys one's relationship with God and can even endanger entire communities. So sin must be dealt with seriously. God provides a process whereby sin may be forgiven and guilt may be set aside. It begins with admitting you are wrong and then following the requisite sacrifices. But note: these sacrifices only atone for sins committed unwittingly. There is no sacrifice offered for sins committed deliberately. Eternal One: 3\u00a0If the person anointed as priest commits a sin, he brings guilt on the people and they suffer the consequences. So the priest must offer the most valuable animal\u2014an unblemished, young bull\u2014to Me as a purification offering for sin.

", "6": "While in the tent, he is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it seven times before Me in front of the veil of the sanctuary. ", "7": "He must then approach the altar of fragrant incense and place some of the blood on its horns before Me. He must then pour the rest of the bull's blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering located near the entrance of the congregation tent.

It must be burned in the place where the ashes are dumped.", "13": "This procedure makes sure that the priest does not benefit from his own sins. Nothing is left over from the sacrifice for him to consume and enjoy. If the entire community of Israel unintentionally commits a sin and, for a time at least, the sin goes unnoticed by the community, and they have violated any one of the directives I gave them, and they are guilty, ", "14": "then later when the sin is realized, the community must offer a young bull as a purification offering for sin. They must bring the bull to the entrance of the congregation tent. ", "15": "The community elders are to place their hands on the bull's head and then slaughter the bull in My presence.

This is the purification offering for sin when the entire community is involved.", "22-23": "The following are instructions for what to do when a leader unwittingly commits a sin by violating any of My directives: When he realizes his guilt or the sin he committed is brought to his attention, then he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering.", "24": "He is to place his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it in the same spot where the burnt offerings are slaughtered in My presence. The goat is to be presented as a purification offering for sin.

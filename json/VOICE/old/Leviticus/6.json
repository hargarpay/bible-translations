He will repay it entirely plus \u2155 of its value. He must give it to its rightful owner the very day he gives his guilt offering. ", "6": "He is to bring to the priest an unblemished ram or its equivalent value as his guilt offering to Me. ", "7": "The priest will make atonement and cover the guilty person's wrong before Me, and the guilty will be forgiven for anything that he did wrong.", "8": "The Eternal One spoke again to Moses.", "9": "Eternal One: 9\u00a0Give Aaron and his sons these instructions regarding the ritual of the burnt offering: The burnt offering must stay on the wood-fire all night until morning arrives. The fire on the altar is to be tended and kept burning during the night.

", "11": "Then the priest must remove his ritual clothes and dress in other clothes to transport the ashes to a ritually clean space outside the camp. ", "12": "The fire on the altar must burn continually; it must not be allowed to go out. The priests are to feed wood to the fire every morning, arrange the burnt offering on the fire, and offer up the fat portions of the peace offerings.

They must eat it without yeast in the holy place or in the courtyard around the sanctuary. ", "17": "It must not be baked with yeast. I am assigning this as their portion of the fire-offerings.

It will be their portion of the fire-offerings presented to Me. This directive stands throughout all generations. Anything that touches them will become holy.", "19": "Holiness is contagious. We're accustomed to thinking about it in the negative. \u201cA bad apple spoils the barrel,\u201d our Western wisdom instructs us. But the Scriptures are clear that holiness, too, spreads from contact. Essentially, holiness refers to whatever is set apart for God's purpose and use. The act of setting apart creates a reality that can transform anything it touches. Holy bread consumed in the holy place by holy priests created a holiness that could spread throughout the community. The Eternal One continued to Moses.", "20": "Eternal One: 20\u00a0Here are instructions for the ritual sacrifice which Aaron and his sons are to offer Me on the day Aaron is anointed high priest: bring four pints of the finest flour as a grain offering.

", "26": "The priest who presents the purification offering is to eat his portion of it in a sacred place inside the courtyard around the sanctuary. ", "27": "Anything that comes in contact with the flesh of the sacrifice will be made holy. When the blood of the sacrifice gets on any clothing, you must wash the bloodstain out in a sacred place.

{"1": "The Eternal One gave Moses the rules regarding the fulfillment of vows.", "2": "Now there is nothing to suggest that God requires His people to make vows; but when they do, they must be taken seriously. So if a person pledges to give God something in exchange for His help or blessing on a matter, then that person is bound to keep his promise. It would be better not to make a vow in the first place than to make it and not fulfill it. Eternal One: 2\u00a0Go, talk with the Israelites and tell them that whenever someone makes a special vow to Me regarding the value of a human being, ", "3": "the proper value of a 20- to 60-year-old male is 20 ounces of silver, according to the sanctuary weights.

They are taken to the market and sold; the money gained from the sale supports the priests and their service.

", "5": "The priest must offer it all up on the altar as a fire-offering to Me. It is a guilt offering. ", "6": "Every man who is a priest may eat of it, as long as he eats in a holy place; it is most sacred.", "7": "The guilt offering is similar to the purification offering for sin. The instructions are the same for both rituals. The priest who makes the atoning sacrifice is allowed to have some of it. ", "8": "Also, the priest who presents anyone's burnt offering gets to keep the skin from what he has offered for himself.

None of it is to be left over for the next day.

To deal with these matters decisively requires decisive action. Like a deadly disease, sin has to be quarantined. The Eternal One continued to Moses.", "23": "Eternal One: 23\u00a0Go, talk with the Israelites, and tell them not to eat any fat from an ox, sheep, or goat. ", "24": "If an animal dies a natural death or is killed by another animal, then you are allowed to make use of its fat, but under no condition are you allowed to eat any of it.

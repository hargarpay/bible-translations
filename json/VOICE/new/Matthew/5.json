{"1": "People talk about this Jesus, this Preacher and Healer. Word spreads of His charisma and wisdom and power and love. People who are too sick to walk persuade their friends and relatives to carry them to Jesus. These cripples and demonized and ill and paralytics come to Jesus, and He heals them, and they follow Him. Now when He saw the crowds, He went up on a mountain (as Moses had done before Him) and He sat down (as Jewish teachers of His day usually did). His disciples gathered around Him.", "2": "There on the mountain Jesus teaches them all. And as He is teaching, crowds gather around and overhear His teachings, listen in, and are captivated. This, the Sermon on the Mount, is the first of the five Mosaic-like sermons in Matthew. And He began to teach them.", "3": "Jesus: Blessed are the spiritually poor\u2014the kingdom of heaven is theirs.", "4": "Blessed are those who mourn\u2014they will be comforted.", "5": "Blessed are the meek and gentle\u2014they will inherit the earth.", "6": "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness\u2014they will be filled.", "7": "Blessed are the merciful\u2014they will be shown mercy.", "8": "Blessed are those who are pure in heart\u2014they will see God.", "9": "Blessed are the peacemakers\u2014they will be called children of God.", "10": "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness\u2014the kingdom of heaven is theirs.", "11": "And blessed are you, blessed are all of you, when people persecute you or denigrate you or despise you or tell lies about you on My account. ", "12": "But when this happens, rejoice. Be glad. Remember that God's prophets have been persecuted in the past. And know that in heaven, you have a great reward.", "13": "Salt draws out the good flavors subtly hidden in food and preserves what would otherwise spoil, as do those who claim to be children of God. You, beloved, are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes bland and loses its saltiness, can anything make it salty again? No. It is useless. It is tossed out, thrown away, or trampled.", "14": "And you, beloved, are the light of the world. A city built on a hilltop cannot be hidden. ", "15": "Similarly it would be silly to light a lamp and then hide it under a bowl. When someone lights a lamp, she puts it on a table or a desk or a chair, and the light illumines the entire house. ", "16": "You are like that illuminating light. Let your light shine everywhere you go, that you may illumine creation, so men and women everywhere may see your good actions, may see creation at its fullest, may see your devotion to Me, and may turn and praise your Father in heaven because of it.", "17": "Do not think that I have come to overturn or do away with the law or the words of our prophets. To the contrary: I have not come to overturn them but to fulfill them.", "18": "This, beloved, is the truth: until heaven and earth disappear, not one letter, not one pen stroke, will disappear from the sacred law\u2014for everything, everything in the sacred law will be fulfilled and accomplished. ", "19": "Anyone who breaks even the smallest, most obscure commandment\u2014not to mention teaches others to do the same\u2014will be called small and obscure in the kingdom of heaven. Those who practice the law and teach others how to live the law will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ", "20": "For I tell you this: you will not enter the kingdom of heaven unless your righteousness goes deeper than the Pharisees', even more righteous than the most learned learner of the law.", "21": "Righteousness is the reason Jesus has come\u2014to make the people righteous through and through. He then begins to interpret the law of Scripture for them with this in mind. As you know, long ago God instructed Moses to tell His people, \u201cDo not murder;[a] those who murder will be judged and punished.\u201d ", "22": "But here is the even harder truth: anyone who is angry with his brother will be judged for his anger. Anyone who taunts his friend, speaks contemptuously toward him, or calls him \u201cLoser\u201d or \u201cFool\u201d or \u201cScum,\u201d will have to answer to the high court. And anyone who calls his brother a fool may find himself in the fires of hell.", "23": "Therefore, if you are bringing an offering to God and you remember that your brother is angry at you or holds a grudge against you, ", "24": "then leave your gift before the altar, go to your brother, repent and forgive one another, be reconciled, and then return to the altar to offer your gift to God.", "25": "If someone sues you, settle things with him quickly. Talk to him as you are walking to court; otherwise, he may turn matters over to the judge, and the judge may turn you over to an officer, and you may land in jail.

", "29": "If your right eye leads you into sin, gouge it out and throw it in the garbage\u2014for better you lose one part of your body than march your entire body through the gates of sin and into hell. ", "30": "And if your right hand leads you into sin, cut it off and throw it away\u2014for better you lose one part of your body than march your entire body through the gates of sin and into hell.", "31": "And here is something else: you have read in Deuteronomy that anyone who divorces his wife must do so fairly\u2014he must give her the requisite certificate of divorce and send her on her way, free and unfettered.[c] ", "32": "But I tell you this: unless your wife cheats on you, you must not divorce her, period. Nor are you to marry someone who has been married and divorces, for a divorced person who remarries commits adultery.", "33": "You know that God expects us to abide by the oaths we swear and the promises we make. ", "34": "But I tell you this: do not ever swear an oath. What is an oath? You cannot say, \u201cI swear by heaven\u201d\u2014for heaven is not yours to swear by; it is God's throne. ", "35": "And you cannot say, \u201cI swear by this good earth,\u201d for the earth is not yours to swear by; it is God's footstool. And you cannot say, \u201cI swear by the holy city Jerusalem,\u201d for it is not yours to swear by; it is the city of God, the capital of the King of kings. ", "36": "You cannot even say that you swear by your own head, for God has dominion over your hands, your lips, your head. It is He who determines if your hair be straight or curly, white or black; it is He who rules over even this small scrap of creation. ", "37": "You need not swear an oath\u2014any impulse to do so is of evil. Simply let your \u201cyes\u201d be \u201cyes,\u201d and let your \u201cno\u201d be \u201cno.\u201d", "38": "You know that Hebrew Scripture sets this standard of justice and punishment: take an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.[d] ", "39": "But I say this, don't fight against the one who is working evil against you. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, you are to turn and offer him your left cheek. ", "40": "If someone connives to get your shirt, give him your jacket as well. ", "41": "If someone forces you to walk with him for a mile, walk with him for two instead. ", "42": "If someone asks you for something, give it to him. If someone wants to borrow something from you, do not turn away.", "43": "You have been taught to love your neighbor and hate your enemy.[e] ", "44": "But I tell you this: love your enemies. Pray for those who torment you and persecute you\u2014", "45": "in so doing, you become children of your Father in heaven. He, after all, loves each of us\u2014good and evil, kind and cruel.

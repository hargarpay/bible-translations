{"1": "Jesus spoke to His disciples and to the crowds that had gathered around.", "2": "Jesus with the Pharisees listening uses them as an example of the pious but truly unrighteous. He calls the people to mind the Pharisees' words, not their examples, because they talk about righteousness and faithfulness, but they are a faithless and unrighteous crew. Jesus: 2\u00a0The Pharisees and the scribes occupy the seat of Moses. ", "3": "So you should do the things they tell you to do\u2014but don't do the things they do. ", "4": "They heap heavy burdens upon their neighbors' backs, and they prove unwilling to do anything to help shoulder the load. ", "5": "They are interested, above all, in presentation: they wrap their heads and arms in the accoutrements of prayer, they cloak themselves with flowing tasseled prayer garments, ", "6": "they covet the seats of honor at fine banquets and in the synagogue, ", "7": "and they love it when people recognize them in the marketplace, call them \u201cTeacher,\u201d and beam at them.", "8": "But you: do not let anyone call you \u201cRabbi,\u201d that is, \u201cTeacher.\u201d For you are all brothers, and you have only one teacher, the Anointed One. ", "9": "Indeed, do not call anyone on earth \u201cFather,\u201d for you have only one father, and He is in heaven. ", "10": "Neither let anyone call you \u201cleader,\u201d for you have one leader\u2014the Anointed One. ", "11": "If you are recognized at all, let it be for your service. Delight in the one who calls you servant. ", "12": "For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.", "13": "Woe to you, you teachers of the law and Pharisees. There is such a gulf between what you say and what you do. You will stand before a crowd and lock the door of the kingdom of heaven right in front of everyone; you won't enter the Kingdom yourselves, and you prevent others from doing so.", "14": "[14\u00a0Woe to you, you teachers of the law and Pharisees. What you say is not what you do. You steal the homes from under the widows while you pretend to pray for them. You will suffer great condemnation for this.][a]", "15": "Woe to you Pharisees, woe to you who teach the law, hypocrites! You traverse hills and mountains and seas to make one convert, and then when he does convert, you make him much more a son of hell than you are.", "16": "Woe to you who are blind but deign to lead others. You say, \u201cSwearing by the temple means nothing, but he who swears by the gold in the temple is bound by his oath.\u201d ", "17": "Are you fools? You must be blind! For which is greater: the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred? ", "18": "You also say, \u201cSwearing by the altar means nothing, but he who swears by the sacrifice on the altar is bound by his oath.\u201d ", "19": "You must be blind! Which is greater: the sacrifice or the altar that makes it sacred? ", "20": "So anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by the sacrifices and gifts laid upon it.

You tithe from your luxuries and your spices, giving away a tenth of your mint, your dill, and your cumin. But you have ignored the essentials of the law: justice, mercy, faithfulness. It is practice of the latter that makes sense of the former. ", "24": "You hypocritical, blind leaders. You spoon a fly from your soup and swallow a camel.", "25": "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You remove fine layers of film and dust from the outside of a cup or bowl, but you leave the inside full of greed and covetousness and self-indulgence.

You are like a grave that has been whitewashed. You look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside you are full of moldering bones and decaying rot. ", "28": "You appear, at first blush, to be righteous, selfless, and pure; but on the inside you are polluted, sunk in hypocrisy and confusion and lawlessness.", "29": "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

You won't escape the judgment of hell.", "34": "That is why I am sending you prophets and wise men, teachers of breadth and depth and substance. You will kill some of them and crucify others. You will flog others in your synagogues. You will pursue them from town to town.

I have longed to gather your children the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you refuse to be gathered.

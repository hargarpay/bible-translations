He's casting them out by the power of Beelzebul\u2014the ancient Philistine god\u2014the prince of demons.", "23": "When Jesus heard this, He tried to reason with them using parables. Jesus: Listen.

As Jesus' ministry grows, some of His friends and family start to get nervous: they wonder if He has \u201clost His mind\u201d entirely. They just can't understand what is happening and why He is so important. It doesn't seem right\u2014the boy next door from Nazareth receiving so much attention. In fact, they are so uncomfortable with it that they decide to intervene and take Him home. But Jesus' family isn't the only group concerned about Him. The Pharisees are doing their best to spread doubt about His authority with the worst accusations possible: His power to heal comes from the devil himself. They are attacking Him publicly and questioning His identity as the Anointed One. When Jesus' mother and brothers arrived, they couldn't break through the crowd, so they sent word in to Jesus that He should come out to them. ", "32": "The crowd was pressed in tight around Him when He received the message, \u201cYour mother and brothers [and sisters][c] are waiting outside for You.\u201d", "33": "Jesus looked around.

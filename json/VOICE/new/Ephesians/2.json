{"1": "Often in his letters, Paul records his prayers for his churches. He is constantly talking with God about those he considers his spiritual children. He prays that God will grant them wisdom, knowledge, and great power. This is the same power that was at work when God raised Jesus from the dead and seated Him in heaven. Ultimately Paul knows all powers have been subjected to Jesus, the God-man, and He is destined to be head over all creation. In the resurrection of Jesus, the ultimate redemption of the cosmos has begun, and the church is the first act of God's glorious drama. As for you, don't you remember how you used to just exist? Corpses, dead in life, buried by transgressions, ", "2": "wandering the course of this perverse world. You were the offspring of the prince of the power of air\u2014oh, how he owned you, just as he still controls those living in disobedience. I'm not talking about the outsiders alone; ", "3": "we were all guilty of falling headlong for the persuasive passions of this world; we all have had our fill of indulging the flesh and mind, obeying impulses to follow perverse thoughts motivated by dark powers. As a result, our natural inclinations led us to be children of wrath, just like the rest of humankind.", "4": "But God, with the unfathomable richness of His love and mercy focused on us, ", "5": "united us with the Anointed One and infused our lifeless souls with life\u2014even though we were buried under mountains of sin\u2014and saved us by His grace. ", "6": "He raised us up with Him and seated us in the heavenly realms with our beloved Jesus the Anointed, the Liberating King. ", "7": "He did this for a reason: so that for all eternity we will stand as a living testimony to the incredible riches of His grace and kindness that He freely gives to us by uniting us with Jesus the Anointed. ", "8-9": "For it's by God's grace that you have been saved. You receive it through faith. It was not our plan or our effort. It is God's gift, pure and simple. You didn't earn it, not one of us did, so don't go around bragging that you must have done something amazing. ", "10": "For we are the product of His hand, heaven's poetry etched on lives, created in the Anointed, Jesus, to accomplish the good works God arranged long ago.", "11": "The relationship between faith and works is often misunderstood. Some think that salvation is God's reward for good deeds. If that's true, then it can't possibly be a gift. If it were a reward, then heaven would be a place where people might compare notes on what they did to make it through the gates. But Paul is confident in the truth of the gospel. The truth is that salvation is God's gift through Jesus. Grace and faith make salvation real in us. When we are transformed by grace, then we become His new creation and begin to live out the good works He has planned for us. Works, then, aren't the cause of salvation; they are its result. To put it another way, works aren't the means of salvation; they are its presence. So never forget how you used to be. Those of you born as outsiders to Israel were outcasts, branded \u201cthe uncircumcised\u201d by those who bore the sign of the covenant in their flesh, a sign made with human hands. ", "12": "You had absolutely no connection to the Anointed; you were strangers, separated from God's people. You were aliens to the covenant they had with God; you were hopelessly stranded without God in a fractured world. ", "13": "But now, because of Jesus the Anointed and His sacrifice, all of that has changed. God gathered you who were so far away and brought you near to Him by the royal blood of the Anointed, our Liberating King.", "14": "He is the embodiment of our peace, sent once and for all to take down the great barrier of hatred and hostility that has divided us so that we can be one. ", "15": "He offered His body on the sacrificial altar to bring an end to the law's ordinances and dictations that separated Jews from the outside nations. His desire was to create in His body one new humanity from the two opposing groups, thus creating peace. ", "16": "Effectively the cross becomes God's means to kill off the hostility once and for all so that He is able to reconcile them both to God in this one new body.", "17": "The Great Preacher of peace and love came for you, and His voice found those of you who were near and those who were far away. ", "18": "By Him both have access to the Father in one Spirit. ", "19": "And so you are no longer called outcasts and wanderers but citizens with God's people, members of God's holy family, and residents of His household. ", "20": "You are being built on a solid foundation: the message of the prophets and the voices of God's chosen emissaries[a] with Jesus, the Anointed Himself, the precious cornerstone. ", "21": "The building is joined together stone by stone\u2014all of us chosen and sealed in Him, rising up to become a holy temple in the Lord. ", "22": "In Him you are being built together, creating a sacred dwelling place among you where God can live in the Spirit."}

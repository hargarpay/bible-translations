Tolerate one another in an atmosphere thick with love. ", "3": "Make every effort to preserve the unity the Spirit has already created, with peace binding you together.", "4": "Now that Paul has described the new world as God would have it, he urges believers to live out their callings with humility, patience, and love: to walk as Jesus walked. These are the ways of Jesus. Paul encourages them to do whatever it takes to hold onto the unity that binds people together in peace. He does not ask them to create that unity; this has already been accomplished through the work of the Rescuer and His Spirit. Rather, he calls believers to guard that unity\u2014a more modest but no less significant task\u2014because that unity is founded on God's oneness and work in the world. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were all called to pursue one hope.

", "13": "These ministries will continue until we are unified in faith and filled with the knowledge of the Son of God, until we stand mature in His teachings and fully formed in the likeness of the Anointed, our Liberating King. ", "14": "Then we will no longer be like children, tossed around here and there upon ocean waves, picked up by every gust of religious teaching spoken by liars or swindlers or deceivers.

They are strangers and aliens to the kind of life God has for them because they live in ignorance and immorality and because their hearts are cold, hard stones.

Thieves must go to work like everyone else and work honestly with their hands so that they can share with anyone who has a need. ", "29": "Don't let even one rotten word seep out of your mouths. Instead, offer only fresh words that build others up when they need it most. That way your good words will communicate grace to those who hear them.

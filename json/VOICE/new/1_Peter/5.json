{"1": "Now for the elders of the church. I want to encourage you. As you know, I am an elder, too, like you. I have witnessed firsthand the sufferings of the Anointed One as well as shared in the glories which are soon to be revealed. ", "2": "When you shepherd the flock God has given you, watch over them not because you have to but because you want to. For this is how God would want it not because you're being compensated somehow but because you are eager to watch over them. ", "3": "Don't lead them as if you were a dictator, but lead your flock by example; ", "4": "and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will be crowned with honor that will shine brightly forever. ", "5": "You who are younger in the faith: do as your elders and leaders ask. All of you should treat each other with humility, for as it says in Proverbs, God opposes the proud but offers grace to the humble.[a]", "6": "So bow down under God's strong hand; then when the time comes, God will lift you up. ", "7": "Since God cares for you, let Him carry all your burdens and worries.", "8": "Humility is rarely a virtue that our culture values. We're trained from an early age to show our strengths and hide our weaknesses. This type of thinking also spills over into our models of leadership, as we learn to dictate to others how they should perform. Peter, however, says that we should be humble in our relationships with one another and not lead as dictators. In fact, this humility before one another and God is actually the position of the greatest strength. Our enemy desires to consume us, but we find strength to resist him when we are dependent upon God for His strength. Most importantly, be disciplined and stay on guard. Your enemy the devil is prowling around outside like a roaring lion, just waiting and hoping for the chance to devour someone. ", "9": "Resist him and be strong in your faith, knowing that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are fellow sufferers with you. ", "10": "After you have suffered for a little while, the God of grace who has called you [to His everlasting presence][b] through Jesus the Anointed will restore you, support you, strengthen you, and ground you. ", "11": "For all power belongs to God, now and forever. Amen.", "12": "Silvanus,[c] whom I consider a trustworthy and faithful brother, is carrying this brief letter to encourage you and to testify that here is the true grace of God. Hold on to it.", "13": "The church here in Babylon[d] chosen by God together with you, sends you greetings. So does my son in the faith Mark.", "14": "Greet each other with a kiss of love, and may peace come to all who follow Jesus the Anointed."}

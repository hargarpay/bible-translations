{"1": "Jeremiah is known as the prophet of the new covenant. Hundreds of years before the birth of Jesus, Jeremiah heard the voice of God and saw what God had planned: a new day. A new law inscribed in the mind and written on the heart. A new and abiding knowledge of God. A new covenant where mercy runs deep and sins are forgiven and forgotten. This hope of a new heart is found even in the midst of the Mosaic Covenant. Moses foretells the unfaithfulness of the people and also tells them of God's promise to restore their hearts (Deuteronomy 30:1\u201310). Even that first covenant had rules and regulations about how to worship and how to set up an earthly sanctuary for God. ", "2": "In the Book of Exodus,[a] we read how the first tent was set aside for worship\u2014we call it the holy place\u2014how inside it they placed an oil lamp, a table, and the bread that was consecrated to God. ", "3": "Behind a second dividing curtain, there was another tent which is called the most holy place. ", "4": "In there they placed the golden incense altar and the golden ark of the covenant. Inside the ark were the golden urn that contained manna (the miraculous food God gave our ancestors in the desert), Aaron's rod that budded,[b] and the tablets of the covenant that Moses brought down from the mountain. ", "5": "Above the ark were the golden images of heavenly beings[c] of glory who shadowed the mercy seat. I cannot go into any greater detail about this now. ", "6": "When all is prepared as it is supposed to be, the priests go back and forth daily into the first tent to carry out the duties described in the law. ", "7": "But once a year, the high priest goes alone into that second tent, the most holy place, with blood to offer for himself and the unwitting errors of the people. ", "8": "As long as that first tent is standing, the Holy Spirit shows us, the way into the most holy place has not yet been revealed to us. ", "9": "That first tent symbolizes the present time, when gifts and sacrifices can be offered; but it can't change the heart and conscience of the worshiper. ", "10": "These gifts and sacrifices deal only with regulations for the body\u2014food and drink and various kinds of ritual cleansings necessary until the time comes to make things truly right.", "11": "When the Anointed One arrived as High Priest of the good things that are to come, He entered through a greater and more perfect sanctuary that was not part of the earthly creation or made by human hands. ", "12": "He entered once for all time into the most holy place\u2014entering, not with the blood of goats or calves or some other prescribed animal, but offering His own blood and thus obtaining redemption for us for all time. ", "13": "Think about it: if the blood of bulls or of goats, or the sprinkling of ashes from a heifer, restores the defiled to bodily cleanliness and wholeness; ", "14": "then how much more powerful is the blood of the Anointed One, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself as a spotless sacrifice to God, purifying your conscience from the dead things of the world to the service of the living God?", "15": "This is why Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant: through His death, He delivered us from the sins that we had built up under the first covenant, and His death has made it possible for all who are called to receive God's promised inheritance. ", "16": "For whenever there is a testament\u2014a will\u2014the death of the one who made it must be confirmed ", "17": "because a will takes effect only at the death of its maker; it has no validity as long as the maker is still alive. ", "18": "Even the first testament\u2014the first covenant\u2014required blood to be put into action. ", "19": "When Moses had given all the laws of God to the people, he took the blood of calves and of goats, water, hyssop, and scarlet wool; and he sprinkled the scroll and all the people, ", "20": "telling them, \u201cThis is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for us.\u201d[d] ", "21": "In the same way, he also sprinkled blood upon the sanctuary and upon the vessels used in worship. ", "22": "Under the law, it's almost the case that everything is purified in connection with blood; without the shedding of blood, sin cannot be forgiven.", "23": "In chapter 9 we are reminded that what is most real, what is most true, is the unseen reality. The writer tells us that the temple in Jerusalem, the holiest place on earth, was merely a copy or shadow of another place, the heavenly temple. Whatever took place in this shadowy temple could not change the realities of alienation from God, sin, and death. Every year on the Day of Atonement, the high priest would don his priestly garb and enter the most holy place in the temple. His task was profound, his duty dangerous: he must appear before God carrying the sins of his people. All the sins of Israel were concentrated in him as he carried the blood of the sacrifice into the divine presence. But there was another day, a Day of Atonement unlike any other, when Jesus concentrated in Himself the sins of the world, hanging on a cross not far from the temple's holiest chamber. Indeed, for a time, He became sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). But unlike the high priest, the crucified and risen Jesus entered the true temple of heaven and was ushered into the divine presence. At that moment, everything changed. Since what was given in the old covenant was the earthly sketch of the heavenly reality, this was sufficient to cleanse the earthly sanctuary; but in heaven, a more perfect sacrifice was needed. ", "24": "The Anointed One did not enter into handcrafted sacred spaces\u2014imperfect copies of heavenly originals\u2014but into heaven itself, where He stands in the presence of God on our behalf. ", "25": "There He does not offer Himself over and over as a sacrifice (as the high priest on earth does when he enters the most holy place each year with blood other than his own) ", "26": "because that would require His repeated suffering since the beginning of the world. No, He has appeared once now, at the end of the age, to put away sin forever by offering Himself as a sacrifice.", "27": "Just as mortals are appointed to die once and then to experience a judgment, ", "28": "so the Anointed One, our Liberating King, was offered once in death to bear the sins of many and will appear a second time, not to deal again with sin, but to rescue those who eagerly await His return."}

Since it is not the perfect form of these ultimate realities, the offering year after year of these imperfect sacrifices cannot bring perfection to those who come forward to worship. ", "2": "If they had served this purpose, wouldn't the repetition of these sacrifices have become unnecessary? If they had worked\u2014and cleansed the worshipers\u2014then one sacrifice would have taken away their consciousness of sin. ", "3": "But these sacrifices actually remind us that we sin again and again, year after year. ", "4": "In the end, the blood of bulls and of goats is powerless to take away sins. ", "5": "So when Jesus came into the world, He said, Sacrifices and offerings were not what You wanted, but instead a body that You prepared for Me.", "6": "Burnt offerings and sin offerings were not what pleased You.", "7": "Then I said, \u201cSee, I have come to do Your will, God, as it is inscribed of Me in the scroll of the book.\u201d[a]", "8": "Now when it says that God doesn't want and takes no real pleasure in sacrifices, burnt offerings, and sin offerings (even though the law calls for them), ", "9": "and follows this with \u201cSee, I have come to do Your will,\u201d[b] He effectively takes away the first\u2014animal sacrifice\u2014in order to establish the second, more perfect sacrifice. ", "10": "By God's will, we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus the Anointed once and for all time.", "11": "In the first covenant, every day every officiating priest stands at his post serving, offering over and over those same sacrifices that can never take away sin. ", "12": "But after He stepped up to offer His single sacrifice for sins for all time, He sat down in the position of honor at the right hand of God. ", "13": "Since then, He has been waiting for the day when He rests His feet on His enemies' backs,[c] as the psalm says.

After he says,", "16": "\u201cBut when those days are over,\u201d says the Eternal One, \u201cI will make this kind of covenant with the people of Israel: I will put My laws in their hearts and write them upon their minds,\u201d[d] then He adds,", "17": "I will erase their sins and wicked acts out of My memory as though they had never existed.[e]", "18": "When there is forgiveness such as this, there is no longer any need to make an offering for sin.", "19": "So, my friends, Jesus by His blood gives us courage to enter the most holy place.

We assemble because we are called into being by God Himself. Some people, for reasons only they know, choose to live their Christian faiths in isolation. When they do, they cut themselves off from the gifts, encouragement, and vitality of others. And perhaps, just as tragically, they deprive the church of the grace and life God has invested in them. Now if we willfully persist in sin after receiving such knowledge of the truth, then there is no sacrifice left for those sins\u2014", "27": "only the fearful prospect of judgment and a fierce fire that will consume God's adversaries.

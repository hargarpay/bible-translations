{"1": "So let me sum up what we've covered so far, for there is much we have said: we have a High Priest, a perfect Priest who sits in the place of honor in the highest heavens, at the right hand of the throne of the Majestic One, ", "2": "a Minister within the heavenly sanctuary set up by the Lord, not by human hands.", "3": "As I have said, it is the role of every high priest to offer gifts and sacrifices to God, so clearly this Priest of ours must have something to offer as well. ", "4": "If He were on earth, then He would not be a priest at all because there are already priests who can offer gifts according to the law of Moses ", "5": "in a sanctuary that is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary.

In those days, all will know Me, from the least to the greatest.", "12": "I will be merciful when they fail, and I will erase their sins and wicked acts out of My memory as though they had never existed.\u201d[b]", "13": "With the words \u201ca new covenant,\u201d God made the first covenant old, and what is old and no longer effective will soon fade away completely."}

{"1": "As to you, Titus: talk to them; give them a good, healthy diet of solid teaching so they will know the right way to live.", "2": "Here's what I want you to teach the older men: enjoy everything in moderation, respect yourselves and others, be sensible, and dedicate yourselves to living an unbroken faith demonstrated by your love and perseverance.", "3": "And here's what I want you to teach the older women: Be respectful. Steer clear of gossip or drinking too much so that you can teach what is good ", "4": "to young women. Be a positive example, showing them what it is to love their husbands and children, and teaching them to ", "5": "control themselves in every way and to be pure. Train them to manage the household, to be kind, and to be submissive to their husbands, all of which honor the word of God.", "6": "Encourage the young men in the same way: in every situation, they should learn to control themselves.", "7-8": "Titus, you have to set a good example for everyone. Go out of your way to do what is right, speak the truth with the weight and authority that come from an honest and pure life. No one can argue with that. Then your enemies will cower in shame because they have nothing bad to say against us.", "9": "Advise all the servants: Work hard for your masters, and be loyal to them. Strive to please. Don't be rude or sarcastic. ", "10": "Don't steal or embezzle your masters' property. Show them you are trustworthy, and all the credit will go to the teaching of God our Savior.", "11": "We have cause to celebrate because the grace of God has appeared, offering the gift of salvation to all people. ", "12": "Grace arrives with its own instruction: run away from anything that leads us away from God; abandon the lusts and passions of this world; live life now in this age with awareness and self-control, doing the right thing and keeping yourselves holy. ", "13": "Watch for His return; expect the blessed hope we all will share when our great God and Savior, Jesus the Anointed, appears again. ", "14": "He gave His body for our sakes and will not only break us free from the chains of wickedness, but He will also prepare a community uncorrupted by the world that He would call His own\u2014people who are passionate about doing the right thing.", "15": "At times Paul can be unrelenting. As he challenged Timothy in the two letters he addressed to him, Paul also challenges Titus to live the truth he teaches. People are drawn toward God, not through bold arguments, but by passionate godliness. We must be passionate about doing the right thing. Our actions tell the story. Our lives are living parables, shouting the mystery of godliness. Paul tells Titus to be bold, to teach with authority, and not to let anyone belittle him. We get a clear picture of a strong, courageous giant of a man. Titus is sent to the people of Crete\u2014a people short on virtue and long on vice\u2014to fashion a church of loving disciples. So, Titus, tell them all these things. Encourage and teach them with all authority\u2014and rebuke them with the same. You are a man called to serve, so don't let anyone belittle you."}

{"1": "As the story unfolds, we're told that the lampstands signify the churches. During harsh times of persecution, the faithful often wonder where their Master is. Is He even aware of what they are experiencing? John's vision confirms what the gospel already teaches: Jesus is present with them even in their suffering, moving among those who dare to bear the light. Lampstands, of course, are not the light. They only carry the light. The true Light that has come into the world is none other than Jesus, the Son of Man (John 8:28). The One: Write down My words, and send them to the messenger of the church in Ephesus. \u201cThese are the words of the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks and moves among the golden lampstands:", "2": "\u201cI know your deeds, your tireless labor, and your patient endurance.

I also hate what they do.", "7": "\u201cLet the person who is able to hear, listen to and follow what the Spirit proclaims to all the churches.

But now in his vision, he sees a different kind of city, the holy city, the new Jerusalem. As he looks around its streets of gold and magnificent buildings, he sees no temple reaching into the sky. No temple is needed in this city because God and the Lamb live with them, constantly in view. Their throne sits prominently in the city. Their light forever illumines its streets and citizens. My heavenly guide brought me to the river of pure living waters, shimmering as brilliantly as crystal. It flowed out from the throne of God and of the Lamb, ", "2": "flowing down the middle and dividing the street of the holy city.

No one is denied access to its luscious fruit and healing leaves. No one or nothing will labor under any curse any longer. And the throne of God and of the Lamb will sit prominently in the city. God's servants will continually serve and worship Him. ", "4": "They will be able to look upon His face, and His name will be written on their foreheads.

I am a servant with you, with your brothers and sisters the prophets, and with those who keep the words contained in this book. Worship God instead!", "10": "(continuing) Do not seal up the prophetic words contained in this book for another day, for the finale is near. ", "11": "Let the one given to evil continue down evil's path and the one addicted to filth continue to be its servant. But let the one who is righteous journey along the righteous road, and let the holy continue in holy ways.", "12": "The Anointed One: 12\u00a0See, I am coming soon, and I will bring My reward with Me.

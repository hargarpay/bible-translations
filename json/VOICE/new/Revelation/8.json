", "5": "The messenger filled the censer with fiery coals from the altar and cast it upon the earth, causing a great commotion of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.", "6": "Throughout the ages God's people have been asking Him for justice in their prayers and laments. Now, in response to these, God pours out His judgment. The seven heavenly messengers raised the seven trumpets and prepared to sound them.", "7": "The first messenger sounded his trumpet, and a blast of hail and fire mixed with blood was cast down to the earth.

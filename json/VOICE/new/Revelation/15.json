{"1": "The New Testament God is not a God of fluffy love as some suppose. His judgment, while difficult to comprehend, is real; and fear of it should motivate repentance now. Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing: seven messengers with seven plagues\u2014plagues that marked the end. With these the wrath of God reached its end.", "2": "And then I saw something like a sea made of glass mixed with fire flashing through it. Those who had been victorious over the beast, its image, and the number of its name were standing on the sea of glass, holding the harps of God in their hands. ", "3": "As they stand and play their harps, they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. Victors: Great and amazing are Your works, Lord God, the All Powerful. Right and true are Your ways, King of all nations.", "4": "Who will not fear You, Lord? Who will not glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, all the nations will come and worship before You, For Your righteous judgments have been revealed.", "5": "After I had taken all this in, I looked again; and the inner part of the tabernacle of witness opened in heaven. ", "6": "Out of the temple came seven messengers, clothed in pure linen, bright and shining, their chests clad in a golden sash, carrying seven plagues. ", "7": "Then one of the four living creatures stepped over to give to the seven messengers seven golden bowls brimming with the wrath of God who lives throughout the ages. ", "8": "The temple was full of the smoke billowing from the magnificent glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven messengers accomplished their God-ordained end."}

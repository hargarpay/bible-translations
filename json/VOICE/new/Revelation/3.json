{"1": "For centuries many Jews had been scattered throughout the known world, exiled to the lands east of the Jordan River from the promised land by powerful invading nations. After Jerusalem fell in a.d. 70, even more Jews left Judea, this time crossing the Mediterranean looking for some place far from Roman cruelty. That's why, as John writes these letters to churches in Asia Minor, he recalls some of the most infamous characters from Israel's past\u2014Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel. The ordeals facing John's churches are not all that different from those Israel faced hundreds of years before. Many of the same struggles plague churches in the West to this day. The names may change, but the problems confronting God's faithful do not. The One: Write down My words, and send them to the messenger of the church in Sardis. \u201cThese are the words of the One who has the seven Spirits of God, the Perfect Spirit, and the One who holds the seven stars: \u201cI know the things you do\u2014you've claimed a reputation of life, but you are actually dead. ", "2": "Wake up from your death-sleep, and strengthen what remains of the life you have been given that is in danger of death. I have judged your deeds as far from complete in the sight of My God. ", "3": "Therefore, remember what you have received and heard; it's time to keep these instructions and turn back from your ways.[a] If you do not wake up from this sleep, I will come in judgment. I will creep up on you like a thief\u2014you will have no way of knowing when I will come. ", "4": "But there are a few in Sardis who don't have the stain of evil works on their clothes. They will walk alongside Me in white, spotless garments because they have been proven worthy.", "5": "\u201cThe one who conquers through faithfulness even unto death will be clothed in white garments, and I will certainly not erase that person's name from the book of life. I will acknowledge this person's name before My Father and before His heavenly messengers.", "6": "\u201cLet the person who is able to hear, listen to and follow what the Spirit proclaims to all the churches.\u201d", "7": "Write down My words, and send them to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia. \u201cThese are the words of the holy One, the true One, and the One who possesses the key of David, which opens the possibilities so that no one can shut them. The One who closes all options so that no one can open:", "8": "\u201cI know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door, which no one can shut. I have done this because you have limited strength, yet you have obeyed My word and have not denied My name. ", "9": "Watch, and I will make those of the congregation of Satan\u2014those who call themselves 'Jews' but are not because they lie\u2014come before you penitent, falling at your feet. Then they will know how much I have loved you. ", "10": "Because you have obeyed My instructions to endure and be patient, I will protect you from the time of trial which will come upon the whole earth and put everyone in it to the test. ", "11": "I will soon return. Hold tight to what you have so that no one can take away your victor's wreath.", "12": "\u201cAs for the one who conquers through faithfulness even unto death, I will plant that person as a pillar in the temple of My God, and that person will never have to leave the presence of God. Moreover, I will inscribe this person with the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, New Jerusalem\u2014which descends out of heaven from My God\u2014and My own new name.", "13": "God's intention for the world is this: \u201cI will be your God, and you will be my people.\u201d This is fulfilled by those who are faithful to Him. \u201cLet the person who is able to hear, listen to and follow what the Spirit proclaims to all the churches.\u201d", "14": "Write down My words, and send them to the messenger of the church in Laodicea. \u201cThese are the words of the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of God's creation:", "15": "\u201cI know your works. You are neither cold with apathy nor hot with passion. It would be better if you were one or the other, but you are neither. ", "16": "So because you are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth. ", "17": "You claim, 'I am rich, I have accumulated riches, and I need nothing'; but you do not realize that you are miserable, pathetic, poor, blind, and naked. ", "18": "So here is what I suggest you do: buy true gold from Me (gold refined by fire so that you can be truly rich), white garments (to cover you so that you can keep the shame of your nakedness from showing), and eye ointment (to treat your eyes so that you may see clearly).", "19": "\u201cThose I love I also correct and discipline. Therefore, be shamelessly committed to Me, and turn back.[b] ", "20": "Now pay attention; I am standing at the door and knocking. If any of you hear My voice and open the door, then I will come in to visit with you and to share a meal at your table, and you will be with Me.", "21": "\u201cThe one who conquers through faithfulness even unto death I will place next to Me on My throne, just as I Myself conquered and took a place of honor with My Father on His throne.", "22": "\u201cLet the person who is able to hear, listen to and follow what the Spirit proclaims to all the churches.\u201d"}

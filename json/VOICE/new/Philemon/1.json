", "3": "May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Anointed surround you.", "4": "I am constantly thanking God for you in my prayers ", "5": "because I keep hearing about your love and faith toward our Lord Jesus and all those set apart for His purposes. Here's what I've been praying on your behalf:", "6": "Thank You, Father, for Philemon. I pray that as he goes and tells his story of faith, he would tell everyone so that they will know for certain all the good that comes to those who put their trust in the Anointed One.", "7": "My brother, because you are out there encouraging and reviving the hearts of fellow saints with such love, this brings great joy and comfort to me.", "8": "Although I am bold enough in the Anointed, our Liberating King, to insist you do the right thing, ", "9": "instead I choose to appeal to you on account of love. I do this for my own sake since I, Paul, am an old man and am held prisoner because of my service to Jesus the Anointed.

So if you look upon me as your partner in this mission, then I ask you to open your heart to him as you would welcome me. ", "18": "And if he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge it to me.

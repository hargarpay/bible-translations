But instead of addressing each separately, Paul suggests a new course of action: let my record be based on the fruit in your lives. The Corinthians had experienced the promised effects of the new covenant\u2014transformed hearts through the Spirit\u2014as prophesied by Jeremiah (31) and Ezekiel (36\u201337). If the Corinthians agree the Spirit is working in them, then they have to agree that Paul's ministry to them is productive. How do we stand up to the same test? If our lives were judged based on the fruit of the seeds we have planted and nurtured in the lives of others, would we be proud or mortified?

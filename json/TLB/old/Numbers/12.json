{"1": "One day Miriam and Aaron were criticizing Moses because his wife was a Cushite woman,[a] ", "2": "and they said, \u201cHas the Lord spoken only through Moses? Hasn't he spoken through us, too?\u201d But the Lord heard them. ", "3-4": "Immediately he summoned Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to the Tabernacle: \u201cCome here, you three,\u201d he commanded. So they stood before the Lord. (Now Moses was the humblest man on earth.)", "5": "Then the Lord descended in the Cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle. \u201cAaron and Miriam, step forward,\u201d he commanded; and they did. ", "6": "And the Lord said to them, \u201cEven with a prophet, I would communicate by visions and dreams; ", "7-8": "but that is not how I communicate with my servant Moses. He is completely at home in my house! With him I speak face-to-face! And he shall see the very form of God! Why then were you not afraid to criticize him?\u201d", "9": "Then the anger of the Lord grew hot against them, and he departed.

When Aaron saw what had happened, ", "11": "he cried out to Moses, \u201cOh, sir, do not punish us for this sin; we were fools to do such a thing.

Let her be banished from the camp for seven days, and after that she can come back again.\u201d", "15": "So Miriam was excluded from the camp for seven days, and the people waited until she was brought back in before they traveled again. ", "16": "Afterwards they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran."}

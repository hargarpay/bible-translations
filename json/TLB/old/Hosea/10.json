But the more wealth I give her, the more she pours it on the altars of her heathen gods; the richer the harvests I give her, the more beautiful the statues and idols she erects. ", "2": "The hearts of her people are false toward God. They are guilty and must be punished. God will break down their heathen altars and smash their idols.\u201d", "3": "Then they will say, \u201cWe deserted the Lord and he took away our king. But what's the difference? We don't need one anyway!\u201d", "4": "They make promises they don't intend to keep. Therefore punishment will spring up among them like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.

", "6": "This idol\u2014this calf-god thing\u2014will be carted with them when they go as slaves to Assyria, a present to the great king there. Ephraim will be laughed at for trusting in this idol; Israel will be put to shame. ", "7": "As for Samaria, her king shall disappear like a chip of wood upon an ocean wave. ", "8": "And the idol altars of Aven at Bethel where Israel sinned will crumble. Thorns and thistles will grow up to surround them.

I have never put her under a heavy yoke before; I have spared her tender neck. But now I will harness her to the plow and harrow. Her days of ease are gone.", "12": "\u201cPlant the good seeds of righteousness, and you will reap a crop of my love; plow the hard ground of your hearts, for now is the time to seek the Lord, that he may come and shower salvation upon you.", "13": "\u201cBut you have cultivated wickedness and raised a thriving crop of sins. You have earned the full reward of trusting in a lie\u2014believing that military might and great armies can make a nation safe!", "14": "\u201cTherefore, the terrors of war shall rise among your people, and all your forts will fall, just as at Beth-arbel, which Shalman[b] destroyed; even mothers and children were dashed to death there.

", "3": "Beg him to save you, all who are humble\u2014all who have tried to obey. Walk humbly and do what is right; perhaps even yet the Lord will protect you from his wrath in that day of doom.", "4": "Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron\u2014these Philistine cities, too, will be rooted out and left in desolation. ", "5": "And woe to you Philistines[a] living on the coast and in the land of Canaan, for the judgment is against you too. The Lord will destroy you until not one of you is left. ", "6": "The coastland will become a pasture, a place of shepherd camps and folds for sheep.", "7": "There the little remnant of the tribe of Judah will be pastured. They will lie down to rest in the abandoned houses in Ashkelon.

All her cedar paneling will lie open to the wind and weather.", "15": "This is the fate of that vast, prosperous city that lived in such security, that said to herself, \u201cIn all the world there is no city as great as I.\u201d But now\u2014see how she has become a place of utter ruins, a place for animals to live!

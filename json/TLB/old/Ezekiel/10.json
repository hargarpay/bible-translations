", "3": "The Guardian Angels were standing at the south end of the Temple when the man went in. And the cloud of glory filled the inner court. ", "4": "Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the Guardian Angels and went over to the door of the Temple. The Temple was filled with the cloud of glory, and the court of the Temple was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord. ", "5": "And the sound of the wings of the Guardian Angels was as the voice of Almighty God when he speaks and could be heard clear out in the outer court.", "6": "When the Lord told the man in linen clothing to go between the Guardian Angels and take some burning coals from between the wheels, the man went in and stood beside one of the wheels, ", "7-8": "and one of the Guardian Angels reached out his hand (for each of the mighty Angels had, beneath his wings, what looked like human hands) and took some live coals from the flames between the Angels and put them into the hands of the man in linen clothes, who took them and went out.", "9-13": "Each of the four Guardian Angels had a wheel beside him\u2014\u201cThe Whirl-Wheels,\u201d as I heard them called, for each one had a second wheel crosswise within\u2014sparkling like chrysolite, giving off a greenish yellow glow. Because of the construction of these wheels,[b] the Angels could go straight forward in each of four directions; they did not turn when they changed direction but could go in any of the four ways their faces looked.

And the glory of the God of Israel was above them.", "20": "These were the living beings I had seen beneath the God of Israel beside the Chebar Canal. I knew they were the same, ", "21": "for each had four faces and four wings, with what looked like human hands under their wings. ", "22": "Their faces too were identical to the faces of those I had seen at the canal, and they traveled straight ahead, just as the others did."}

", "4": "The inner room was 35\u00a0feet square. \u201cThis,\u201d he told me, \u201cis the Most Holy Place.\u201d", "5": "Then he measured the wall of the Temple and found that it was 10\u00bd feet thick, with a row of rooms along the outside. Each room was 7\u00a0feet wide. ", "6": "These rooms were in three tiers, one above the other, with thirty rooms in each tier. The whole structure was supported by girders and not attached to the Temple wall for support.

", "17-18": "The space above the door leading into the Holy of Holies was also paneled. The walls were decorated with carvings of Guardian Angels, each with two faces, and of palm trees alternating with the Guardian Angels.

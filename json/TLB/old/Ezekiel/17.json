I will tell you. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (the first of the two eagles),[b] came to Jerusalem, took away her king and princes (her topmost buds and shoots),* and brought them to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar made a covenant with a member of the royal family (Zedekiah),* and made him take an oath of loyalty. He took a seedling and planted it in fertile ground beside a broad river.

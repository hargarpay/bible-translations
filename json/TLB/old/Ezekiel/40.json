{"1": "Early in April of the twenty-fifth year of our exile\u2014the fourteenth year after Jerusalem was captured\u2014the hand of the Lord was upon me, ", "2": "and in a vision he took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a high mountain where I saw what appeared to be a city opposite me. ", "3": "Going nearer, I saw a man whose face shone like bronze, standing beside the Temple gate,[a] holding in his hand a measuring tape and a measuring stick.", "4": "He said to me: \u201cSon of dust, watch and listen and take to heart everything I show you, for you have been brought here so I can show you many things; and then you are to return to the people of Israel to tell them all you have seen.\u201d ", "5": "The man began to measure the wall around the outside of the Temple area with his measuring stick, which was 10\u00bd feet long. He told me, \u201cThis wall is 10\u00bd feet high and 10\u00bd feet wide.\u201d ", "6": "Then he took me over to the passageway that goes through the eastern wall. We climbed the seven steps into the entrance, and he measured the entry hall of the passage; it was 10\u00bd feet wide.", "7-12": "Walking on through the passageway I saw that there were three guardrooms on each side; each of these rooms was 10\u00bd feet square, with a distance of 8\u00be feet along the wall between them. In front of these rooms was a low barrier 18\u00a0inches high and 18\u00a0inches wide.[b] Beyond the guardrooms was a 10\u00bd-foot doorway opening into a 14-foot hall with 3\u00bd-foot columns. Beyond this hall, at the inner end of the passageway, was a vestibule 22\u00be feet wide and 17\u00bd feet long.", "13": "Then he measured the entire outside width of the passageway, measuring across the roof from the outside doors of the guardrooms; this distance was 43\u00be feet. ", "14": "Then he estimated the pillars on each side of the porch to be about 100 feet high. ", "15": "The full length of the entrance passage was 87\u00bd feet from one end to the other. ", "16": "There were windows that narrowed inward through the walls along both sides of the passageway and along the guardroom walls. The windows were also in the exit and in the entrance halls. The pillars were decorated with palm tree decorations.", "17": "And so we passed through the passageway to the court inside. A stone pavement ran around the inside of the walls, and thirty rooms were built against the walls, opening onto this pavement. ", "18": "This was called \u201cthe lower pavement.\u201d It extended out from the walls into the court the same distance as the passageway did.", "19": "Then he measured across to the wall on the other side of this court (which\u00a0was called \u201cthe outer court\u201d of the Temple)[c] and found that the distance was 175 feet. ", "20": "As I followed, he left the eastern passageway and went over to the passage through the northern wall and measured it. ", "21": "Here, too, there were three guardrooms on each side, and all the measurements were the same as for the east passageway\u201487\u00bd feet long and 43\u00be feet from side to side across the top of the guardrooms. ", "22": "There were windows, an entry hall, and the palm tree decorations just the same as on the east side. And there were seven steps leading up to the doorway to the entry hall inside.", "23": "Here at the north entry, just as at the east, if one walked through the passageway into the court and straight across it, he came to an inner wall and a passageway through it to an inner court. The distance between the two passageways was 175 feet. ", "24": "Then he took me around to the south gate and measured the various sections of its passageway and found they were just the same as in the others. ", "25": "It had windows along the walls as the others did, and an entry hall. And like the others, it was 87\u00bd feet long and 43\u00be feet wide. ", "26": "It, too, had a stairway of seven steps leading up to it, and there were palm tree decorations along the walls. ", "27": "And here again, if one walked through the passageway into the court and straight across it, he came to the inner wall and a passageway through it to the inner court. And the distance between the passageways was 175 feet.", "28": "Then he took me over to the inner wall and its south passageway. He measured this passageway and found that it had the same measurements as the passageways of the outer wall.[d] ", "29-30": "Its guardrooms, pillars, and entrance and exit hall were identical to all the others, and so were the windows along its walls and entry. And, like the others, it was 87\u00bd feet long by 43\u00be feet wide.[e] ", "31": "The only difference was that it had eight steps leading up to it instead of seven. It had palm tree decorations on the pillars, just as the others.", "32": "Then he took me along the court to the eastern entrance of the inner wall, and measured it. It, too, had the same measurements as the others. ", "33": "Its guardrooms, pillars, and entrance hall were the same size as those of the other passageways, and there were windows along the walls and in the entry hall; and it was 87\u00bd feet long by 43\u00be feet wide. ", "34": "Its entry hall faced the outer court, and there were palm tree decorations on its columns, but there were eight steps instead of seven going up to the entrance.", "35": "Then he took me around to the north gate of the inner wall, and the measurements there were just like the others: ", "36": "The guardrooms, pillars, and entry hall of this passageway were the same as the others, with a length of 87\u00bd feet and a width of 43\u00be feet. ", "37": "Its entry hall faced toward the outer court; it had palm tree decorations on the walls of each side of the passageway, and there were eight steps leading up to the entrance.", "38": "But a door led from its entry hall into a side room where the flesh of the sacrifices was washed before being taken to the altar; ", "39": "on each side of the entry hall of the passageway there were two tables where the animals for sacrifice were slaughtered for the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings to be presented in the Temple. ", "40": "Outside the entry hall, on each side of the stairs going up to the north entrance, there were two more tables. ", "41": "So, in all there were eight tables, four inside and four outside, where the sacrifices were cut up and prepared. ", "42": "There were also four stone tables where the butchering knives and other implements were laid. These tables were about 2\u215d feet square and 1\u00be feet high. ", "43": "There were hooks, 3\u00a0or\u00a04\u00a0inches long, fastened along the walls of the entry hall, and on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.", "44": "In the inner court there were two one-room buildings, one beside the northern entrance, facing south, and one beside the southern entrance, facing north.", "45": "And he said to me: \u201cThe building beside the inner northern gate is for the priests who supervise the maintenance. ", "46": "The building beside the inner southern entrance is for the priests in charge of the altar\u2014the descendants of Zadok\u2014for they alone of all the Levites may come near to the Lord to minister to him.\u201d", "47": "Then he measured the inner court in front of the Temple[f] and found it to be 175 feet square, and there was an altar in the court, standing in front of the Temple. ", "48-49": "Then he brought me to the entrance hall of the Temple. Ten steps led up to it from the inner court. Its walls extended up on either side to form two pillars, each of them 8\u00be feet thick. The entrance was 24\u00bd feet wide with 5\u00bc-foot walls. Thus the entry hall was 35\u00a0feet wide and 19\u00bc feet long."}

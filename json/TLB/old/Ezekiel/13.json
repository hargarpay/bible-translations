Woe upon them!", "4": "\u201cO\u00a0Israel, these 'prophets' of yours are as useless as foxes for rebuilding your walls! ", "5": "O\u00a0evil prophets, what have you ever done to strengthen the walls of Israel against her enemies\u2014by strengthening Israel in the Lord? ", "6": "Instead you have lied when you said, 'My message is from God!' God did not send you. And yet you expect him to fulfill your prophecies. ", "7": "Can you deny that you have claimed to see 'visions' you never saw, and that you have said, 'This message is from God,' when I never spoke to you at all?\u201d", "8": "Therefore the Lord God says: \u201cI will destroy you for these 'visions' and lies.

", "14": "I will break down your whitewashed wall; it will fall on you and crush you, and you shall know I am the Lord. ", "15": "Then at last my wrath against the wall will be completed; and concerning those who praised it, I will say: The wall and its builders both are gone.

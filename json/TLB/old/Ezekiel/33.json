", "5": "For he heard the warning and wouldn't listen; the fault is his. If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved his life. ", "6": "But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn't sound the alarm and warn the people, he is responsible for their deaths. They will die in their sins, but I will charge the watchman with their deaths.'", "7": "\u201cSo with you, son of dust.

How can we live?' ", "11": "Tell them: 'As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; I desire that the wicked turn from his evil ways and live. Turn, turn from your wickedness, for why will you die, O\u00a0Israel?

But if he sins, expecting his past goodness to save him, then none of his good deeds will be remembered. I will destroy him for his sins.

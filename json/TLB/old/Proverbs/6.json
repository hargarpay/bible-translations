Get out of it if you possibly can! Swallow your pride; don't let embarrassment stand in the way. Go and beg to have your name erased. ", "4": "Don't put it off. Do it now. Don't rest until you do. ", "5": "If you can get out of this trap you have saved yourself like a deer that escapes from a hunter or a bird from the net.", "6": "Take a lesson from the ants, you lazy fellow. Learn from their ways and be wise! ", "7": "For though they have no king to make them work, ", "8": "yet they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter. ", "9": "But you\u2014all you do is sleep. When will you wake up? ", "10": "\u201cLet me sleep a little longer!\u201d Sure, just a little more! ", "11": "And as you sleep, poverty creeps upon you like a robber and destroys you; want attacks you in full armor.", "12-13": "Let me describe for you a worthless and a wicked man; first, he is a constant liar; he signals his true intentions to his friends with eyes and feet and fingers. ", "14": "He is always thinking up new schemes to swindle people. He stirs up trouble everywhere. ", "15": "But he will be destroyed suddenly, broken beyond hope of healing.", "16-19": "For there are six things the Lord hates\u2014no, seven: haughtiness, lying, murdering, plotting evil, eagerness to do wrong, a false witness, sowing discord among brothers.", "20": "Young man, obey your father and your mother.

", "27": "Can a man hold fire against his chest and not be burned? ", "28": "Can he walk on hot coals and not blister his feet? ", "29": "So it is with the man who commits adultery with another's wife. He shall not go unpunished for this sin. ", "30": "Excuses might even be found for a thief if he steals when he is starving! ", "31": "But even so, he is fined seven times as much as he stole, though it may mean selling everything in his house to pay it back.", "32": "But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool, for he destroys his own soul.

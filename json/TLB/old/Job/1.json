{"1": "There lived in the land of Uz a man named Job\u2014a good[a] man who feared God and stayed away from evil. ", "2-3": "He had a large family of seven sons and three daughters and was immensely wealthy,[b] for he owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and employed many servants. He was, in fact, the richest cattleman in that entire area.", "4": "Every year when Job's sons had birthdays, they invited their brothers and sisters to their homes for a celebration. On these occasions they would eat and drink with great merriment. ", "5": "When these birthday parties ended\u2014and sometimes they lasted several days\u2014Job would summon his children to him and sanctify them, getting up early in the morning and offering a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said, \u201cPerhaps my sons have sinned and turned away from God[c] in their hearts.\u201d This was Job's regular practice.", "6": "One day as the angels[d] came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan, the Accuser, came with them.", "7": "\u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d the Lord asked Satan. And Satan replied, \u201cFrom earth, where I've been watching everything that's going on.\u201d", "8": "Then the Lord asked Satan, \u201cHave you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth\u2014a good man[e] who fears God and will have nothing to do with evil.\u201d", "9": "\u201cWhy shouldn't he when you pay him so well?\u201d Satan scoffed. ", "10": "\u201cYou have always protected him and his home and his property from all harm. You have prospered everything he does\u2014look how rich he is! No wonder he 'worships' you! ", "11": "But just take away his wealth, and you'll see him curse you to your face!\u201d", "12-13": "And the Lord replied to Satan, \u201cYou may do anything you like with his wealth, but don't harm him physically.\u201d So Satan went away; and sure enough, not long afterwards when Job's sons and daughters were dining at the oldest brother's house, tragedy struck.", "14-15": "A messenger rushed to Job's home with this news: \u201cYour oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them, when the Sabeans raided us, drove away the animals, and killed all the farmhands except me. I am the only one left.\u201d", "16": "While this messenger was still speaking, another arrived with more bad news: \u201cThe fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the herdsmen, and I alone have escaped to tell you.\u201d", "17": "Before this man finished, still another messenger rushed in: \u201cThree bands of Chaldeans have driven off your camels and killed your servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you.\u201d", "18": "As he was still speaking, another arrived to say, \u201cYour sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother's home, ", "19": "when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and engulfed the house so that the roof fell in on them and all are dead; and I alone escaped to tell you.\u201d", "20": "Then Job stood up and tore his robe in grief[f] and fell down upon the ground before God. ", "21": "\u201cI came naked from my mother's womb,\u201d he said, \u201cand I shall have nothing when I die. The Lord gave me everything I had, and they were his to take away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.\u201d", "22": "In all of this Job did not sin or revile God."}

", "5-7": "When wild donkeys bray, it is because their grass is gone; oxen do not low when they have food; a man complains when there is no salt in his food. And how tasteless is the uncooked white of an egg\u2014my appetite is gone when I look at it; I gag at the thought of eating it!", "8-9": "\u201cOh, that God would grant the thing I long for most\u2014to die beneath his hand and be freed from his painful grip.

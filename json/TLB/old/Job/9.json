", "3": "If God decides to argue with him, can a man answer even one question of a thousand he asks? ", "4": "For God is so wise and so mighty. Who has ever opposed him successfully?", "5": "\u201cSuddenly he moves the mountains, overturning them in his anger. ", "6": "He shakes the earth to its foundations. ", "7": "The sun won't rise, the stars won't shine, if he commands it so! ", "8": "Only he has stretched the heavens out and stalked along the seas.

Who dares to ask him, 'What are you doing?'", "13": "\u201cAnd God does not abate his anger. The pride of man[b] collapses before him.

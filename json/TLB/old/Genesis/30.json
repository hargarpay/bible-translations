", "8": "Rachel named him Naphtali (meaning \u201cWrestling\u201d), for she said, \u201cI am in a fierce contest with my sister and I am winning!\u201d", "9": "Meanwhile, when Leah realized that she wasn't getting pregnant anymore, she gave her servant girl Zilpah to Jacob, to be his wife, ", "10": "and soon Zilpah presented him with a son.

Rachel begged Leah to give some of them to her.", "15": "But Leah angrily replied, \u201cWasn't it enough to steal my husband? And now will you steal my son's mandrakes too?\u201d Rachel said sadly, \u201cHe will sleep with you tonight because of the mandrakes.\u201d", "16": "That evening as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. \u201cYou must sleep with me tonight!\u201d she said; \u201cfor I am hiring you with some mandrakes my son has found!\u201d So he did.

Whatever it is, I'll pay it.\u201d", "29": "Jacob replied, \u201cYou know how faithfully I've served you through these many years, and how your flocks and herds have grown. ", "30": "For it was little indeed you had before I came, and your wealth has increased enormously; Jehovah has blessed you from everything I do! But now, what about me? When should I provide for my own family?\u201d", "31-32": "\u201cWhat wages do you want?\u201d Laban asked again. Jacob replied, \u201cIf you will do one thing, I'll go back to work for you. Let me go out among your flocks today and remove all the goats that are speckled or spotted, and all the black sheep. Give them to me as my wages.

He gave them to Jacob's sons to take them three days' distance, and Jacob stayed and cared for Laban's flock. ", "37": "Then Jacob took fresh shoots from poplar, almond, and sycamore trees, and peeled white streaks in them, ", "38": "and placed these rods beside the watering troughs so that Laban's flocks would see them when they came to drink; for that is when they mated. ", "39-40": "So the flocks mated before the white-streaked rods, and their offspring were streaked and spotted, and Jacob added them to his flock. Then he divided out the ewes from Laban's flock and segregated them from the rams, and let them mate only with Jacob's black rams. Thus he built his flocks from Laban's. ", "41": "Moreover, he watched for the stronger animals to mate, and placed the peeled branches before them, ", "42": "but didn't with the feebler ones. So the less healthy lambs were Laban's and the stronger ones were Jacob's!

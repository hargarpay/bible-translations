{"1": "The Lord appeared again to Abraham while he was living in the oak grove at Mamre. This is the way it happened: One hot summer afternoon as he was sitting in the opening of his tent, ", "2": "he suddenly noticed three men coming toward him. He sprang up and ran to meet them and welcomed them.", "3-4": "\u201cSirs,\u201d he said, \u201cplease don't go any farther. Stop awhile and rest here in the shade of this tree while I get water to refresh your feet, ", "5": "and a bite to eat to strengthen you. Do stay awhile before continuing your journey.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d they said, \u201cdo as you have said.\u201d", "6": "Then Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah, \u201cQuick! Mix up some pancakes![a] Use your best flour, and make enough for the three of them!\u201d ", "7": "Then he ran out to the herd and selected a fat calf and told a servant to hurry and butcher it. ", "8": "Soon, taking them cheese and milk and the roast veal, he set it before the men and stood beneath the trees beside them as they ate.", "9": "\u201cWhere is Sarah, your wife?\u201d they asked him. \u201cIn the tent,\u201d Abraham replied.", "10": "Then the Lord said, \u201cNext year[b] I will give you and Sarah a son!\u201d (Sarah was listening from the tent door behind him.) ", "11": "Now Abraham and Sarah were both very old, and Sarah was long since past the time when she could have a baby.", "12": "So Sarah laughed silently. \u201cA woman my age have a baby?\u201d she scoffed to herself. \u201cAnd with a husband as old as mine?\u201d", "13": "Then God said to Abraham, \u201cWhy did Sarah laugh? Why did she say 'Can an old woman like me have a baby?' ", "14": "Is anything too hard for God? Next year, just as I told you, I will certainly see to it that Sarah has a son.\u201d", "15": "But Sarah denied it. \u201cI didn't laugh,\u201d she lied, for she was afraid.", "16": "Then the men stood up from their meal and started on toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them part of the way.", "17": "\u201cShould I hide my plan from Abraham?\u201d God asked. ", "18": "\u201cFor Abraham shall become a mighty nation, and he will be a source of blessing for all the nations of the earth. ", "19": "And I have picked him out to have godly descendants and a godly household\u2014men who are just and good\u2014so that I can do for him all I have promised.\u201d", "20": "So the Lord told Abraham, \u201cI have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are utterly evil, and that everything they do is wicked. ", "21": "I am going down to see whether these reports are true or not. Then I will know.\u201d", "22-23": "So the other two went on toward Sodom, but the Lord remained with Abraham a while. Then Abraham approached him and said, \u201cWill you kill good and bad alike? ", "24": "Suppose you find fifty godly people there within the city\u2014will you destroy it, and not spare it for their sakes? ", "25": "That wouldn't be right! Surely you wouldn't do such a thing, to kill the godly with the wicked! Why, you would be treating godly and wicked exactly the same! Surely you wouldn't do that! Should not the Judge of all the earth be fair?\u201d", "26": "And God replied, \u201cIf I find fifty godly people there, I will spare the entire city for their sake.\u201d", "27": "Then Abraham spoke again. \u201cSince I have begun, let me go on and speak further to the Lord, though I am but dust and ashes. ", "28": "Suppose there are only forty-five? Will you destroy the city for lack of five?\u201d And God said, \u201cI will not destroy it if I find forty-five.\u201d", "29": "Then Abraham went further with his request. \u201cSuppose there are only forty?\u201d And God replied, \u201cI won't destroy it if there are forty.\u201d", "30": "\u201cPlease don't be angry,\u201d Abraham pleaded. \u201cLet me speak: suppose only thirty are found there?\u201d And God replied, \u201cI won't do it if there are thirty there.\u201d", "31": "Then Abraham said, \u201cSince I have dared to speak to God, let me continue\u2014suppose there are only twenty?\u201d And God said, \u201cThen I won't destroy it for the sake of the twenty.\u201d", "32": "Finally, Abraham said, \u201cOh, let not the Lord be angry; I will speak but this once more! Suppose only ten are found?\u201d And God said, \u201cThen, for the sake of the ten, I won't destroy it.\u201d", "33": "And the Lord went on his way when he had finished his conversation with Abraham. And Abraham returned to his tent."}

", "4-5": "And God was pleased with it and divided the light from the darkness. He called the light \u201cdaytime,\u201d and the darkness \u201cnighttime.\u201d Together they formed the first day.[c]", "6": "And God said, \u201cLet the vapors separate[d] to form the sky above and the oceans below.\u201d ", "7-8": "So God made the sky, dividing the vapor above from the water below. This all happened on the second day.[e]", "9-10": "Then God said, \u201cLet the water beneath the sky be gathered into oceans so that the dry land will emerge.\u201d And so it was. Then God named the dry land \u201cearth,\u201d and the water \u201cseas.\u201d And God was pleased.

", "17": "And God set them in the sky to light the earth, ", "18": "and to preside over the day and night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God was pleased.

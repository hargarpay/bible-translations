{"1": "Now at last the heavens and earth were successfully completed, with all that they contained. ", "2": "So on the seventh day, having finished his task, God ceased from this work he had been doing, ", "3": "and God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because it was the day when he ceased this work of creation.", "4": "Here is a summary of the events in the creation of the heavens and earth when the Lord God made them.", "5": "There were no plants or grain sprouting up across the earth at first, for the Lord God hadn't sent any rain; nor was there anyone to farm the soil. ", "6": "(However, water welled up from the ground at certain places and flowed across the land.)", "7": "The time came when the Lord God formed a man's body from the dust of the ground[a] and breathed into it the breath of life. And man became a living person.", "8": "Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, to the east, and placed in the garden the man he had formed. ", "9": "The Lord God planted all sorts of beautiful trees there in the garden, trees producing the choicest of fruit. At the center of the garden he placed the Tree of Life, and also the Tree of Conscience, giving knowledge of Good and Bad. ", "10": "A river from the land of Eden flowed through the garden to water it; afterwards the river divided into four branches. ", "11-12": "One of these was named the Pishon; it winds across the entire length of the land of Havilah,[b] where nuggets of pure gold are found, also beautiful bdellium and even lapis lazuli.

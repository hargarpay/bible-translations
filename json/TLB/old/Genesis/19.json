{"1": "That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom, and Lot was sitting there as they arrived. When he saw them he stood up to meet them, and welcomed them.", "2": "\u201cSirs,\u201d he said, \u201ccome to my home as my guests for the night; you can get up as early as you like and be on your way again.\u201d \u201cOh, no thanks,\u201d they said, \u201cwe'll just stretch out here along the street.\u201d", "3": "But he was very urgent, until at last they went home with him, and he set a great feast before them, complete with freshly baked unleavened bread. After the meal, ", "4": "as they were preparing to retire for the night, the men of the city\u2014yes, Sodomites, young and old from all over the city\u2014surrounded the house ", "5": "and shouted to Lot, \u201cBring out those men to us so we can rape them.\u201d", "6": "Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him. ", "7": "\u201cPlease, fellows,\u201d he begged, \u201cdon't do such a wicked thing. ", "8": "Look\u2014I have two virgin daughters, and I'll surrender them to you to do with as you wish. But leave these men alone, for they are under my protection.\u201d", "9": "\u201cStand back,\u201d they yelled. \u201cWho do you think you are? We let this fellow settle among us and now he tries to tell us what to do! We'll deal with you far worse than with those other men.\u201d And they lunged at Lot and began breaking down the door.", "10": "But the two men reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door ", "11": "and temporarily blinded the men of Sodom so that they couldn't find the door.", "12": "\u201cWhat relatives do you have here in the city?\u201d the men asked. \u201cGet them out of this place\u2014sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else. ", "13": "For we will destroy the city completely. The stench of the place has reached to heaven and God has sent us to destroy it.\u201d", "14": "So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters' fianc\u00e9s, \u201cQuick, get out of the city, for the Lord is going to destroy it.\u201d But the young men looked at him as though he had lost his senses.", "15": "At dawn the next morning the angels became urgent. \u201cHurry,\u201d they said to Lot, \u201ctake your wife and your two daughters who are here and get out while you can, or you will be caught in the destruction of the city.\u201d", "16": "When Lot still hesitated, the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety, outside the city, for the Lord was merciful.", "17": "\u201cFlee for your lives,\u201d the angels told him. \u201cAnd don't look back. Escape to the mountains. Don't stay down here on the plain or you will die.\u201d", "18-20": "\u201cOh no, sirs, please,\u201d Lot begged, \u201csince you've been so kind to me and saved my life, and you've granted me such mercy, let me flee to that little village over there instead of into the mountains, for I fear disaster in the mountains. See, the village is close by and it is just a small one. Please, please, let me go there instead. Don't you see how small it is? And my life will be saved.\u201d", "21": "\u201cAll right,\u201d the angel said, \u201cI accept your proposition and won't destroy that little city. ", "22": "But hurry! For I can do nothing until you are there.\u201d (From that time on that village was named Zoar, meaning \u201cLittle City.\u201d)", "23": "The sun was rising as Lot reached the village. ", "24": "Then the Lord rained down fire and flaming tar from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah, ", "25": "and utterly destroyed them, along with the other cities and villages of the plain, eliminating all life\u2014people, plants, and animals alike. ", "26": "But Lot's wife looked back as she was following along behind him and became a pillar of salt.", "27": "That morning Abraham was up early and hurried out to the place where he had stood before the Lord. ", "28": "He looked out across the plain to Sodom and Gomorrah and saw columns of smoke and fumes, as from a furnace, rising from the cities there. ", "29": "So God heeded Abraham's plea and kept Lot safe, removing him from the maelstrom of death that engulfed the cities.", "30": "Afterwards Lot left Zoar, fearful of the people there, and went to live in a cave in the mountains with his two daughters. ", "31": "One day the older girl said to her sister, \u201cThere isn't a man anywhere in this entire area that our father would let us marry. And our father will soon be too old for having children. ", "32": "Come, let's fill him with wine and then we will sleep with him, so that our clan will not come to an end.\u201d ", "33": "So they got him drunk that night, and the older girl went in and had sexual intercourse with her father; but he was unaware of her lying down or getting up again.", "34": "The next morning she said to her younger sister, \u201cI slept with my father last night. Let's fill him with wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him, so that our family line will continue.\u201d ", "35": "So they got him drunk again that night, and the younger girl went in and lay with him, and, as before, he didn't know that anyone was there. ", "36": "And so it was that both girls became pregnant from their father. ", "37": "The older girl's baby was named Moab; he became the ancestor of the nation of the Moabites. ", "38": "The name of the younger girl's baby was Benammi; he became the ancestor of the nation of the Ammonites."}

", "2": "He was also told to put Joseph's own silver cup at the top of Benjamin's sack, along with the grain money. So the household manager did as he was told. ", "3": "The brothers were up at dawn and on their way with their loaded donkeys.", "4": "But when they were barely out of the city, Joseph said to his household manager, \u201cChase after them and stop them and ask them why they are acting like this when their benefactor has been so kind to them? ", "5": "Ask them, 'What do you mean by stealing my lord's personal silver drinking cup, which he uses for fortune-telling? What a wicked thing you have done!'\u201d ", "6": "So he caught up with them and spoke to them along the lines he had been instructed.", "7": "\u201cWhat in the world are you talking about?\u201d they demanded. \u201cWhat kind of people do you think we are, that you accuse us of such a terrible thing as that? ", "8": "Didn't we bring back the money we found in the mouth of our sacks? Why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house? ", "9": "If you find his cup with any one of us, let that one die. And all the rest of us will be slaves forever to your master.\u201d", "10": "\u201cFair enough,\u201d the man replied, \u201cexcept that only the one who stole it will be a slave, and the rest of you can go free.\u201d", "11": "They quickly took down their sacks from the backs of their donkeys and opened them.

How can we plead? How can we prove our innocence? God is punishing us for our sins. Sir, we have all returned to be your slaves, both we and he in whose sack the cup was found.\u201d", "17": "\u201cNo,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cOnly the man who stole the cup, he shall be my slave. The rest of you can go on home to your father.\u201d", "18": "Then Judah stepped forward and said, \u201cO\u00a0sir, let me say just this one word to you. Be patient with me for a moment, for I know you can doom me in an instant, as though you were Pharaoh himself.", "19": "\u201cSir, you asked us if we had a father or a brother, ", "20": "and we said, 'Yes, we have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one.

With two of their wings they covered their faces, with two others they covered their feet, and with two they flew. ", "3": "In a great antiphonal chorus they sang, \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is filled with his glory.\u201d ", "4": "Such singing it was! It shook the Temple to its foundations, and suddenly the entire sanctuary was filled with smoke.", "5": "Then I said, \u201cMy doom is sealed, for I am a foul-mouthed sinner, a member of a sinful, foul-mouthed race; and I have looked upon the King, the Lord of heaven's armies.\u201d", "6": "Then one of the mighty angels flew over to the altar and with a pair of tongs picked out a burning coal. ", "7": "He touched my lips with it and said, \u201cNow you are pronounced 'not guilty' because this coal has touched your lips.

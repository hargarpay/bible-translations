Shout to them, O\u00a0Israel, and wave them on as they march against Babylon to destroy the palaces of the rich and mighty. ", "3": "I, the Lord, have set apart these armies for this task; I have called those rejoicing in their strength to do this work, to satisfy my anger. ", "4": "Hear the tumult on the mountains! Listen as the armies march! It is the tumult and the shout of many nations. The Lord Almighty has brought them here, ", "5": "from countries far away. They are his weapons against you, O\u00a0Babylon. They carry his anger with them and will destroy your whole land.", "6": "Scream in terror, for the Lord's time has come, the time for the Almighty to crush you.

You look at one another, helpless, as the flames of the burning city reflect upon your pallid faces. ", "9": "For see, the day of the Lord is coming, the terrible day of his wrath and fierce anger. The land shall be destroyed and all the sinners with it. ", "10": "The heavens will be black above them.

Generation after generation will come and go, but the land will never again be lived in.[a] The nomads will not even camp there. The shepherds won't let their sheep stay overnight.

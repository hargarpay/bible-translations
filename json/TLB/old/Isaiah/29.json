For Jerusalem shall become as her name \u201cAriel\u201d means\u2014an altar covered with blood. ", "3": "I will be your enemy. I will surround Jerusalem and lay siege against it, and build forts around it to destroy it. ", "4": "Your voice will whisper like a ghost from the earth where you lie buried.", "5": "But suddenly your ruthless enemies will be driven away like chaff before the wind. ", "6": "In an instant, I, the Lord of Hosts, will come upon them with thunder, earthquake, whirlwind, and fire. ", "7": "And all the nations fighting Jerusalem will vanish like a dream! ", "8": "As a hungry man dreams of eating but is still hungry, and as a thirsty man dreams of drinking but is still faint from thirst when he wakes up, so your enemies will dream of victorious conquest, but all to no avail.", "9": "You are amazed, incredulous? You don't believe it? Then go ahead and be blind if you must! You are stupid\u2014and not from drinking, either! Stagger, and not from wine! ", "10": "For the Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep. He has closed the eyes of your prophets and seers, ", "11": "so all of these future events are a sealed book to them. When you give it to one who can read, he says, \u201cI can't, for it's sealed.\u201d ", "12": "When you give it to another, he says, \u201cSorry, I can't read.\u201d", "13": "And so the Lord says, \u201cSince these people say they are mine but they do not obey me, and since their worship amounts to mere words learned by rote, ", "14": "therefore I will take awesome vengeance on these hypocrites and make their wisest counselors as fools.\u201d", "15": "Woe to those who try to hide their plans from God, who try to keep him in the dark concerning what they do! \u201cGod can't see us,\u201d they say to themselves. \u201cHe doesn't know what is going on!\u201d ", "16": "How stupid can they be! Isn't he, the Potter, greater than you, the jars he makes? Will you say to him, \u201cHe didn't make us\u201d?

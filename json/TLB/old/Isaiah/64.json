", "2": "The consuming fire of your glory would burn down the forests and boil the oceans dry. The nations would tremble before you; then your enemies would learn the reason for your fame! ", "3": "So it was before when you came down, for you did awesome things beyond our highest expectations, and how the mountains quaked!

But we are not godly; we are constant sinners and have been all our lives. Therefore your wrath is heavy on us. How can such as we be saved? ", "6": "We are all infected and impure with sin. When we put on our prized robes of righteousness, we find they are but filthy rags.[a] Like autumn leaves we fade, wither, and fall. And our sins, like the wind, sweep us away.

Will you stand silent and still punish us?"}

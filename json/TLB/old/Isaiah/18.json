Let swift messengers return to you, O\u00a0strong and supple nation feared far and wide, a conquering, destroying nation whose land the upper Nile divides.[b] And this is the message sent to you:", "3": "When I raise my battle flag upon the mountain, let all the world take notice! When I blow the trumpet, listen!

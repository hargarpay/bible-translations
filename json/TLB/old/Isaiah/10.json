Yes, it is true that they even rob the widows and fatherless children.", "3": "Oh, what will you do when I visit you in that day when I send desolation upon you from a distant land? To whom will you turn then for your help? Where will your treasures be safe? ", "4": "I will not help you; you will stumble along as prisoners or lie among the slain. And even then my anger will not be satisfied, but my fist will still be poised to strike you. ", "5-6": "Assyria is the whip of my anger; his military strength is my weapon upon this godless nation, doomed and damned; he will enslave them and plunder them and trample them like dirt beneath his feet. ", "7": "But the king of Assyria will not know that it is I who sent him. He will merely think he is attacking my people as part of his plan to conquer the world. ", "8": "He will declare that every one of his princes will soon be a king, ruling a conquered land.", "9": "\u201cWe will destroy Calno just as we did Carchemish,\u201d he will say, \u201cand Hamath will go down before us as Arpad did; and we will destroy Samaria just as we did Damascus.

We are great and wise. By our own strength we broke down the walls and destroyed the people and carried off their treasures. ", "14": "In our greatness we have robbed their nests of riches and gathered up kingdoms as a farmer gathers eggs, and no one can move a finger or open his mouth to peep against us!\u201d", "15": "But the Lord says, \u201cShall the ax boast greater power than the man who uses it? Is the saw greater than the man who saws? Can a rod strike unless a hand is moving it? Can a cane walk by itself?\u201d", "16": "Because of all your evil boasting, O\u00a0king of Assyria, the Lord of Hosts will send a plague among your proud troops and strike them down.

In a single night he will burn those thorns and briars, the Assyrians who destroyed the land of Israel.[a] ", "18": "Assyria's vast army is like a glorious forest, yet it will be destroyed. The Lord will destroy them, soul and body, as when a sick man wastes away. ", "19": "Only a few from all that mighty army will be left; so few a child could count them!", "20": "Then at last those left in Israel and in Judah will trust the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, instead of fearing the Assyrians. ", "21": "A remnant of them will return to the mighty God.

He will break the yoke of slavery off their necks and destroy it as decreed.[b]", "28-29": "Look, the mighty armies of Assyria are coming! Now they are at Aiath, now at Migron; they are storing some of their equipment at Michmash and crossing over the pass; they are staying overnight at Geba.

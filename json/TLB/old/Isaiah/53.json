{"1": "But, oh, how few believe it! Who will listen? To whom will God reveal his saving power? ", "2": "In God's eyes[a] he was like a tender green shoot, sprouting from a root in dry and sterile ground. But in our eyes there was no attractiveness at all, nothing to make us want him. ", "3": "We despised him and rejected him\u2014a man of sorrows, acquainted with bitterest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way when he went by. He was despised, and we didn't care.", "4": "Yet it was our grief he bore, our sorrows that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, for his own sins! ", "5": "But he was wounded and bruised for our sins. He was beaten that we might have peace; he was lashed\u2014and we were healed! ", "6": "We\u2014every one of us\u2014have strayed away like sheep! We, who left God's paths to follow our own. Yet God laid on him the guilt and sins of every one of us!", "7": "He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he never said a word. He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he stood silent before the ones condemning him.

However, when his soul has been made an offering for sin, then he shall have a multitude of children, many heirs. He shall live again,[b] and God's program shall prosper in his hands. ", "11": "And when he sees all that is accomplished by the anguish of his soul, he shall be satisfied; and because of what he has experienced, my righteous Servant shall make many to be counted righteous before God, for he shall bear all their sins. ", "12": "Therefore, I will give him the honors of one who is mighty and great because he has poured out his soul unto death. He was counted as a sinner, and he bore the sins of many, and he pled with God for sinners."}

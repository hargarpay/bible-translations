{"1": "The Lord says, People[a] who never before inquired about me are now seeking me out. Nations* who never before searched for me are finding me.", "2": "But my own people\u2014though I have been spreading out my arms to welcome them all day long\u2014have rebelled; they follow their own evil paths and thoughts. ", "3": "All day long they insult me to my face by worshiping idols in many gardens and burning incense on the rooftops of their homes. ", "4": "At night they go out among the graves and caves to worship evil spirits, and they eat pork and other forbidden foods. ", "5": "Yet they say to one another, \u201cDon't come too close, you'll defile me! For I am holier than you!\u201d They stifle me. Day in and day out they infuriate me.", "6": "See, here is my decree all written out before me: I will not stand silent; I will repay. Yes, I will repay them\u2014", "7": "not only for their own sins but for those of their fathers too, says the Lord, for they also burned incense on the mountains and insulted me upon the hills. I will pay them back in full.", "8": "But I will not destroy them all, says the Lord; for just as good grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones (and someone will say, \u201cDon't throw them all away\u2014there are some good grapes there!\u201d) so I will not destroy all Israel, for I have true servants there.

You deliberately sinned before my very eyes, choosing to do what you know I despise.", "13": "Therefore, the Lord God says: You shall starve, but my servants shall eat; you shall be thirsty while they drink; you shall be sad and ashamed, but they shall rejoice. ", "14": "You shall cry in sorrow and vexation and despair, while they sing for joy. ", "15": "Your name shall be a curse word among my people, for the Lord God will slay you and call his true servants by another name.[b]", "16": "And yet, the days will come[c] when all who invoke a blessing or take an oath shall swear by the God of Truth; for I will put aside my anger and forget the evil that you did.

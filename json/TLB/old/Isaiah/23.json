", "2-3": "Deathly silence is everywhere. Stillness reigns where once your hustling port was full of ships from Sidon, bringing merchandise from far across the ocean, from Egypt and along the Nile. You were the merchandise mart of the world. ", "4": "Be ashamed, O\u00a0Sidon,* stronghold of the sea. For you are childless now! ", "5": "When Egypt hears the news, there will be great sorrow. ", "6": "Flee to Tarshish, men of Tyre, weeping as you go. ", "7": "This silent ruin is all that's left of your once joyous land. What a history was yours! Think of all the colonists you sent to distant lands!", "8": "Who has brought this disaster on Tyre, empire builder and top trader of the world?

Then, in the days of another king, the city will come back to life again; she will sing sweet songs as a harlot sings who, long absent from her lovers, walks the streets to look for them again and is remembered. ", "17": "Yes, after seventy years, the Lord will revive Tyre, but she will be no different than she was before; she will return again to all her evil ways around the world. ", "18": "Yet the distant time will come when[b] her businesses will give their profits to the Lord! They will not be hoarded but used for good food and fine clothes for the priests of the Lord!"}

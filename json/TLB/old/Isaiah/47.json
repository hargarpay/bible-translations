", "2": "Take heavy millstones and grind the corn; remove your veil;[a] strip off your robe; expose yourself to public view. ", "3": "You shall be in nakedness and shame. I will take vengeance upon you and will not repent.\u201d", "4": "So speaks our Redeemer, who will save Israel from Babylon's mighty power; the Lord Almighty is his name, the Holy One of Israel.", "5": "Sit in darkness and silence, O\u00a0Babylon; never again will you be called \u201cThe Queen of Kingdoms.\u201d ", "6": "For I was angry with my people Israel and began to punish them a little by letting them fall into your hands, O\u00a0Babylon. But you showed them no mercy. You have made even the old folks carry heavy burdens. ", "7": "You thought your reign would never end, Queen Kingdom of the world. You didn't care a whit about my people or think about the fate of those who do them harm.", "8": "O\u00a0pleasure-mad kingdom, living at ease, bragging as the greatest in the world\u2014listen to the sentence of my court upon your sins.

{"1": "Wake up, wake up, Jerusalem, and clothe yourselves with strength from God.[a] Put on your beautiful clothes, O\u00a0Zion, Holy City; for sinners\u2014those who turn from God\u2014will no longer enter your gates. ", "2": "Rise from the dust, Jerusalem; take off the slave bands from your neck, O\u00a0captive daughter of Zion. ", "3": "For the Lord says: When I sold you into exile, I asked no fee from your oppressors; now I can take you back again and owe them not a cent! ", "4": "My people were tyrannized without cause by Egypt and Assyria, and I delivered them.", "5": "And now, what is this? asks the Lord. Why are my people enslaved again and oppressed without excuse? Those who rule them shout in exultation, and my name is constantly blasphemed day by day. ", "6": "Therefore I will reveal my name to my people, and they shall know the power in that name. Then at last they will recognize that it is I, yes, I, who speaks to them.", "7": "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who bring the happy news of peace and salvation, the news that the God of Israel reigns.

", "14-15": "Yet many shall be amazed when they see him\u2014yes, even far-off foreign nations and their kings; they shall stand dumbfounded, speechless in his presence. For they shall see and understand what they had not been told before. They shall see my Servant beaten and bloodied, so disfigured one would scarcely know it was a person standing there. So shall he cleanse[c] many nations."}

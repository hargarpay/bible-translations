Each of you is to carry out a stone on your shoulder\u2014twelve stones in all, one for each of the twelve tribes. ", "6": "We will use them to build a monument so that in the future, when your children ask, 'What is this monument for?' ", "7": "you can tell them, 'It is to remind us that the Jordan River stopped flowing when the Ark of God went across!' The monument will be a permanent reminder to the people of Israel of this amazing miracle.\u201d", "8": "So the men did as Joshua told them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River\u2014one for each tribe, just as the Lord had commanded Joshua. They carried them to the place where they were camped for the night and constructed a monument there. ", "9": "Joshua also built another monument of twelve stones in the middle of the river, at the place where the priests were standing; and it is there to this day.

", "23": "Tell them how the Lord our God dried up the river right before our eyes and then kept it dry until we were all across! It is the same thing the Lord did forty years ago[b] at the Red Sea!

{"1": "This, too, I carefully explored\u2014that godly and wise men are in God's will; no one knows whether he will favor them or not. All is chance! ", "2-3": "The same providence confronts everyone, whether good or bad, religious or irreligious, profane or godly. It seems so unfair that one fate comes to all. That is why men are not more careful to be good but instead choose their own mad course, for they have no hope\u2014there is nothing but death ahead anyway.", "4": "There is hope only for the living. \u201cIt is better to be a live dog than a dead lion!\u201d ", "5": "For the living at least know that they will die! But the dead know nothing ; they don't even have their memories.[a] ", "6": "Whatever they did in their lifetimes\u2014loving, hating, envying\u2014is long gone, and they have no part in anything here on earth anymore.

He is like a fish caught in a net, or a bird caught in a snare.", "13": "Here is another thing that has made a deep impression on me as I have watched human affairs: ", "14": "There was a small city with only a few people living in it, and a great king came with his army and besieged it. ", "15": "There was in the city a wise man, very poor, and he knew what to do to save the city, and so it was rescued. But afterwards no one thought any more about him. ", "16": "Then I realized that though wisdom is better than strength, nevertheless, if the wise man is poor, he will be despised, and what he says will not be appreciated.

{"1-2": "Woe is me! It is as hard to find an honest man as grapes and figs when harvest days are over. Not a cluster to eat, not a single early fig, however much I long for it! The good men have disappeared from the earth; not one fair-minded man is left. They are all murderers, turning against even their own brothers.", "3": "They go at their evil deeds with both hands, and how skilled they are in using them! The governor and judge alike demand bribes. The rich man pays them off and tells them whom to ruin. Justice is twisted between them. ", "4": "Even the best of them are prickly as briars; the straightest is more crooked than a hedge of thorns. But your judgment day is coming swiftly now; your time of punishment is almost here; confusion, destruction, and terror will be yours.", "5": "Don't trust anyone, not your best friend\u2014not even your wife! ", "6": "For the son despises his father; the daughter defies her mother; the bride curses her mother-in-law. Yes, a man's enemies will be found in his own home.", "7": "As for me, I look to the Lord for his help; I wait for God to save me; he will hear me. ", "8": "Do not rejoice against me, O\u00a0my enemy, for though I fall, I will rise again! When I sit in darkness, the Lord himself will be my Light. ", "9": "I will be patient while the Lord punishes me, for I have sinned against him; then he will defend me from my enemies and punish them for all the evil they have done to me. God will bring me out of my darkness into the light, and I will see his goodness. ", "10": "Then my enemy will see that God is for me and be ashamed for taunting, \u201cWhere is that God of yours?\u201d Now with my own eyes I see them trampled down like mud in the street.", "11": "Your cities, people of God, will be rebuilt, much larger and more prosperous than before. ", "12": "Citizens of many lands will come and honor you\u2014from Assyria to Egypt, and from Egypt to the Euphrates, from sea to sea and from distant hills and mountains.", "13": "But first comes terrible destruction to Israel[a] for the great wickedness of her people. ", "14": "O\u00a0Lord, come and rule your people; lead your flock; make them live in peace and prosperity; let them enjoy the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead as they did long ago.", "15": "\u201cYes,\u201d replies the Lord, \u201cI will do mighty miracles for you, like those when I brought you out of slavery in Egypt. ", "16": "All the world will stand amazed at what I\u00a0will do for you and be embarrassed at their puny might. They will stand in silent awe, deaf to all around them.\u201d ", "17": "They will see what snakes they are, lowly as worms crawling from their holes. They will come trembling out from their fortresses to meet the Lord our God. They will fear him; they will stand in awe.", "18": "Where is another God like you, who pardons the sins of the survivors among his people? You cannot stay angry with your people, for you love to be merciful. ", "19": "Once again you will have compassion on us. You will tread our sins beneath your feet; you will throw them into the depths of the ocean! ", "20": "You will bless us as you promised Jacob long ago. You will set your love upon us, as you promised our father Abraham!"}

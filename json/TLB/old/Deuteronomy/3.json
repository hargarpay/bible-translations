{"1-2": "\u201cNext we turned toward King Og's land of Bashan. He immediately mobilized his army and attacked us at Edrei. But the Lord told me not to be afraid of him. 'All his people and his land are yours,' the Lord told me. 'You will do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites at Heshbon.' ", "3": "So the Lord helped us fight against King Og and his people, and we killed them all. ", "4": "We conquered all sixty of his cities, the entire Argob region of Bashan. ", "5": "These were well-fortified cities with high walls and barred gates. Of course we also took all of the unwalled towns. ", "6": "We utterly destroyed the kingdom of Bashan just as we had destroyed King Sihon's kingdom at Heshbon, killing the entire population\u2014men, women, and children alike. ", "7": "But we kept the cattle and loot for ourselves.", "8": "\u201cWe now possessed all the land of the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan River\u2014all the land from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. ", "9": "(The Sidonians called Mount Hermon 'Sirion,' while the Amorites called it 'Senir.') ", "10": "We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau, and all of Gilead and Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei.", "11": "\u201cIncidentally, King Og of Bashan was the last of the giant Rephaim. His iron bedstead is kept in a museum at Rabbah, one of the cities of the Ammonites, and measures thirteen and a half feet long by six feet wide.", "12": "\u201cAt that time I gave the conquered land to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. To the tribes of Reuben and Gad I gave the area beginning at Aroer on the Arnon River, plus half of Mount Gilead, including its cities. ", "13": "The half-tribe of Manasseh received the remainder of Gilead and all of the former kingdom of King Og, the Argob region. (Bashan is sometimes called 'The Land of the Rephaim.') ", "14": "The clan of Jair, of the tribe of Manasseh, took over the whole Argob region (Bashan) to the borders of the Geshurites and Maacathites. They renamed their country after themselves, calling it Havvoth-jair (meaning 'Jair's Villages') as it is still known today. ", "15": "Then I gave Gilead to the clan of Machir. ", "16": "The tribes of Reuben and Gad received the area extending from the Jabbok River in Gilead (which was the Ammonite frontier) to the middle of the valley of the Arnon River. ", "17": "They also received the Arabah (or wasteland), bounded by the Jordan River on the west, from Chinnereth to Mount Pisgah and the Dead Sea (also called the Sea of the Arabah).", "18": "\u201cAt that time I reminded the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh that, although the Lord had given them the land, they could not begin settling down until their armed men led the other tribes across the Jordan to the land the Lord was giving them.", "19": "\u201c'But your wives and children,' I told them, 'may live here in the cities the Lord has given you, caring for your many cattle ", "20": "until you return after the Lord has given victory to the other tribes too. When they conquer the land the Lord your God has given them across the Jordan River, then you may return here to your own land.'", "21": "\u201cThen I said to Joshua, 'You have seen what the Lord your God has done to those two kings. You will do the same to all the kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan. ", "22": "Don't be afraid of the nations there, for the Lord your God will fight for you.'", "23-25": "\u201cAt that time I made this plea to God: 'O\u00a0Lord God, please let me cross over into the Promised Land\u2014the good land beyond the Jordan River with its rolling hills\u2014and Lebanon. I want to see the result of all the greatness and power you have been showing us; for what God in all of heaven or earth can do what you have done for us?'", "26": "\u201cBut the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not let me cross over. 'Speak of it no more,' he ordered, ", "27": "'but go to the top of Mount Pisgah where you can look out in every direction, and there you will see the land in the distance. But you shall not cross the Jordan River. ", "28": "Commission Joshua to replace you, and then encourage him, for he shall lead the people across to conquer the land you will see from the mountaintop.'", "29": "\u201cSo we remained in the valley near Beth-peor."}

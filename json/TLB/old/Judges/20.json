They came from as far away as Dan and Beersheba, and everywhere between, and from across the Jordan in the land of Gilead.

", "7": "Now then, sons of Israel, express your mind and give me your counsel!\u201d", "8-10": "And as one man they replied, \u201cNot one of us will return home until we have punished the village of Gibeah. A tenth of the army will be selected by lot as a supply line to bring us food, and the rest of us will destroy Gibeah for this horrible deed.\u201d", "11": "So the whole nation united in this task.", "12": "Then messengers were sent to the tribe of Benjamin, asking, \u201cDid you know about the terrible thing that was done among you? ", "13": "Give up these evil men from the city of Gibeah so that we can execute them and purge Israel of her evil.\u201d But the people of Benjamin wouldn't listen.

And the Lord replied, \u201cJudah shall go first.\u201d", "19-20": "So the entire army left early the next morning to go to Gibeah, to attack the men of Benjamin. ", "21": "But the men defending the village stormed out and killed 22,000 Israelis that day. ", "22-24": "Then the Israeli army wept before the Lord until evening and asked him, \u201cShall we fight further against our brother Benjamin?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cYes.\u201d So the men of Israel took courage and went out again the next day to fight at the same place.

", "35-39": "So the Lord helped Israel defeat Benjamin, and the Israeli army killed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day, leaving but a tiny remnant of their forces. Summary of the Battle: The army of Israel retreated from the men of Benjamin in order to give the ambush more room for maneuvering. When the men of Benjamin had killed about thirty of the Israelis, they were confident of a massive slaughter just as on the previous days. But then the men in ambush rushed into the village and slaughtered everyone in it, and set it on fire. The great cloud of smoke pouring into the sky was the signal for the Israeli army to turn around and attack the army of Benjamin, ", "40-41": "who now looked behind them and were terrified to discover that their city was on fire, and that they were in serious trouble.

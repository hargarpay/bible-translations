{"1": "Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat as a present to his wife, intending to sleep with her; but her father wouldn't let him in.", "2": "\u201cI really thought you hated her,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I married her to your best man. But look, her sister is prettier than she is. Marry her instead.\u201d", "3": "Samson was furious. \u201cYou can't blame me for whatever happens now,\u201d he shouted.", "4": "So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied their tails together in pairs, with a torch between each pair. ", "5": "Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the fields of the Philistines, burning the grain to the ground along with all the sheaves and shocks of grain, and destroying the olive trees.", "6": "\u201cWho did this?\u201d the Philistines demanded. \u201cSamson,\u201d was the reply, \u201cbecause his wife's father gave her to another man.\u201d So the Philistines came and got the girl and her father and burned them alive.", "7": "\u201cNow my vengeance will strike again!\u201d Samson vowed. ", "8": "So he attacked them with great fury and killed many of them. Then he went to live in a cave in the rock of Etam. ", "9": "The Philistines in turn sent a huge posse into Judah and raided Lehi.", "10": "\u201cWhy have you come here?\u201d the men of Judah asked. And the Philistines replied, \u201cTo capture Samson and do to him as he has done to us.\u201d", "11": "So three thousand men of Judah went down to get Samson at the cave in the rock of Etam. \u201cWhat are you doing to us?\u201d they demanded of him. \u201cDon't you realize that the Philistines are our rulers?\u201d But Samson replied, \u201cI only paid them back for what they did to me.\u201d", "12-13": "\u201cWe have come to capture you and take you to the Philistines,\u201d the men of Judah told him. \u201cAll right,\u201d Samson said, \u201cbut promise me that you won't kill me yourselves.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they replied, \u201cwe won't do that.\u201d So they tied him with two new ropes and led him away. ", "14": "As Samson and his captors arrived at Lehi, the Philistines shouted with glee; but then the strength of the Lord came upon Samson, and the ropes with which he was tied snapped like thread and fell from his wrists! ", "15": "Then he picked up a donkey's jawbone that was lying on the ground and killed a thousand Philistines with it. ", "16-17": "Tossing away the jawbone, he remarked, \u201cHeaps upon heaps, All with a donkey's jaw! I've killed a thousand men, All with a donkey's jaw!\u201d (The place has been called \u201cJawbone Hill\u201d ever since.)", "18": "But now he was very thirsty and he prayed to the Lord and said, \u201cYou have given Israel such a wonderful deliverance through me today! Must I now die of thirst and fall to the mercy of these heathen?\u201d ", "19": "So the Lord caused water to gush out from a hollow in the ground, and Samson's spirit was revived as he drank. Then he named the place \u201cThe Spring of the Man Who Prayed,\u201d and the spring is still there today.", "20": "Samson was Israel's leader for the next twenty years, but the Philistines still controlled the land."}

The commander-in-chief of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoiim. He had nine hundred iron chariots and made life unbearable for the Israelis for twenty years. But finally they begged the Lord for help.", "4": "Israel's leader at that time, the one who was responsible for bringing the people back to God, was Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth. ", "5": "She held court at a place now called \u201cDeborah's Palm Tree,\u201d between Ramah ad Bethel, in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came to her to decide their disputes.[a]", "6": "One day she summoned Barak (son of Abinoam), who lived in Kedesh, in the land of Naphtali, and said to him, \u201cThe Lord God of Israel has commanded you to mobilize ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun. Lead them to Mount Tabor ", "7": "to fight King Jabin's mighty army with all his chariots, under General Sisera's command. The Lord says, 'I will draw them to the Kishon River, and you will defeat them there.'\u201d", "8": "\u201cI'll go, but only if you go with me!\u201d Barak told her.", "9": "\u201cAll right,\u201d she replied, \u201cI'll go with you; but I'm warning you now that the honor of conquering Sisera will go to a woman instead of to you!\u201d So she went with him to Kedesh.", "10": "When Barak summoned the men of Zebulun and Naphtali to mobilize at Kedesh, ten thousand men volunteered. And Deborah marched with them.

", "12": "When General Sisera was told that Barak and his army were camped at Mount Tabor, ", "13": "he mobilized his entire army, including the nine hundred iron chariots, and marched from Harosheth-hagoiim to the Kishon River.", "14": "Then Deborah said to Barak, \u201cNow is the time for action! The Lord leads on! He has already delivered Sisera into your hand!\u201d So Barak led his ten thousand men down the slopes of Mount Tabor into battle.", "15": "Then the Lord threw the enemy into a panic, both the soldiers and the charioteers, and Sisera leaped from his chariot and escaped on foot.

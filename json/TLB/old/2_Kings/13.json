", "3": "So the Lord was very angry with Israel, and he continually allowed King Hazael of Syria and his son Ben-hadad to conquer them.", "4": "But Jehoahaz prayed for the Lord's help, and the Lord listened to him; for the Lord saw how terribly the king of Syria was oppressing Israel. ", "5": "So the Lord raised up leaders among the Israelis to rescue them from the tyranny of the Syrians; and then Israel lived in safety again as they had in former days. ", "6": "But they continued to sin, following the evil ways of Jeroboam; and they continued to worship the goddess Asherah at Samaria.

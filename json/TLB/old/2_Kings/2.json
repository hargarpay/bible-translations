Elijah said to Elisha as they left Gilgal, \u201cStay here, for the Lord has told me to go to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha replied, \u201cI swear to God that I won't leave you!\u201d So they went on together to Bethel. ", "3": "There the young prophets of Bethel Seminary came out to meet them and asked Elisha, \u201cDid you know that the Lord is going to take Elijah away from you today?\u201d \u201cQuiet!\u201d Elisha snapped. \u201cOf course I know it.\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cPlease stay here in Bethel, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho.\u201d But Elisha replied again, \u201cI swear to God that I won't leave you.\u201d So they went on together to Jericho.", "5": "Then the students at Jericho Seminary came to Elisha and asked him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord is going to take away your master today?\u201d \u201cWill you please be quiet?\u201d he commanded. \u201cOf course I know it!\u201d", "6-7": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cPlease stay here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan River.\u201d But Elisha replied as before, \u201cI swear to God that I won't leave you.\u201d So they went on together and stood beside the Jordan River as fifty of the young prophets watched from a distance. ", "8": "Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it; and the river divided and they went across on dry ground!", "9": "When they arrived on the other side Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cWhat wish shall I grant you before I am taken away?\u201d And Elisha replied, \u201cPlease grant me twice as much prophetic power as you have had.\u201d", "10": "\u201cYou have asked a hard thing,\u201d Elijah replied. \u201cIf you see me when I am taken from you, then you will get your request.

My father! The chariot of Israel and the charioteers!\u201d As they disappeared from sight he tore his robe. ", "13-14": "Then he picked up Elijah's cloak and returned to the bank of the Jordan River, and struck the water with it. \u201cWhere is the Lord God of Elijah?\u201d he cried out. And the water parted and Elisha went across!", "15": "When the young prophets of Jericho saw what had happened, they exclaimed, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha!\u201d And they went to meet him and greeted him respectfully.", "16": "\u201cSir,\u201d they said, \u201cjust say the word and fifty of our best athletes will search the wilderness for your master; perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has left him on some mountain or in some ravine.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Elisha said, \u201cdon't bother.\u201d", "17": "But they kept urging until he was embarrassed and finally said, \u201cAll right, go ahead.\u201d Then fifty men searched for three days, but didn't find him.", "18": "Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned. \u201cDidn't I tell you not to go?\u201d he growled.", "19": "Now a delegation of the city officials of Jericho visited Elisha. \u201cWe have a problem,\u201d they told him. \u201cThis city is located in beautiful natural surroundings, as you can see; but the water is bad and causes our women to have miscarriages.\u201d[a]", "20": "\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cbring me a new bowl filled with salt.\u201d So they brought it to him.", "21": "Then he went out to the city well and threw the salt in and declared, \u201cThe Lord has healed these waters. They shall no longer cause death or miscarriage.\u201d", "22": "And sure enough! The water was purified, just as Elisha had said.", "23": "From Jericho he went to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a gang of young men from the city began mocking and making fun of him because of his bald head.

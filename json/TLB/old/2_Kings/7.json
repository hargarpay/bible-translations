", "4": "\u201cWe will starve if we stay here and we will starve if we go back into the city; so we might as well go out and surrender to the Syrian army. If they let us live, so much the better; but if they kill us, we would have died anyway.\u201d", "5": "So that evening they went out to the camp of the Syrians, but there was no one there!

Tell us, as our president, whether we can build a new one down beside the Jordan River, where there are plenty of logs.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he told them, \u201cgo ahead.\u201d", "3": "\u201cPlease, sir, come with us,\u201d someone suggested. \u201cI will,\u201d he said.", "4": "When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; ", "5": "but as one of them was chopping, his axhead fell into the river. \u201cOh, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201cit was borrowed!\u201d", "6": "\u201cWhere did it fall?\u201d the prophet asked. The youth showed him the place, and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water; and the axhead rose to the surface and floated! ", "7": "\u201cGrab it,\u201d Elisha said to him; and he did.", "8": "Once when the king of Syria was at war with Israel, he said to his officers, \u201cWe will mobilize our forces at ____\u201d (naming the place).", "9": "Immediately Elisha warned the king of Israel, \u201cDon't go near ____\u201d (naming the same place) \u201cfor the Syrians are planning to mobilize their troops there!\u201d", "10": "The king sent a scout to see if Elisha was right, and sure enough, he had saved him from disaster. This happened several times.", "11": "The king of Syria was puzzled. He called together his officers and demanded, \u201cWhich of you is the traitor? Who has been informing the king of Israel about my plans?\u201d", "12": "\u201cIt's not us, sir,\u201d one of the officers replied. \u201cElisha, the prophet, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom!\u201d", "13": "\u201cGo and find out where he is, and we'll send troops to seize him,\u201d the king exclaimed. And the report came back, \u201cElisha is at Dothan.\u201d", "14": "So one night the king of Syria sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city. ", "15": "When the prophet's servant got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. \u201cAlas, my master, what shall we do now?\u201d he cried out to Elisha.", "16": "\u201cDon't be afraid!\u201d Elisha told him. \u201cFor our army is bigger than theirs!\u201d", "17": "Then Elisha prayed, \u201cLord, open his eyes and let him see!\u201d And the Lord opened the young man's eyes so that he could see horses of fire and chariots of fire everywhere upon the mountain!", "18": "As the Syrian army advanced upon them, Elisha prayed, \u201cLord, please make them blind.\u201d And he did.", "19": "Then Elisha went out and told them, \u201cYou've come the wrong way! This isn't the right city! Follow me and I will take you to the man you're looking for.\u201d And he led them to Samaria!", "20": "As soon as they arrived Elisha prayed, \u201cLord, now open their eyes and let them see.\u201d And the Lord did, and they discovered that they were in Samaria, the capital city of Israel!", "21": "When the king of Israel saw them, he shouted to Elisha, \u201cOh, sir, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?\u201d", "22": "\u201cOf course not!\u201d Elisha told him. \u201cDo we kill prisoners of war?

However, what's the matter?\u201d She replied, \u201cThis woman proposed that we eat my son one day and her son the next. So we boiled my son and ate him, but the next day when I said, 'Kill your son so we can eat him,' she hid him.\u201d When the king heard this he tore his clothes. (The people watching noticed through the rip he tore in them that he was wearing an inner robe made of sackcloth next to his flesh.)", "31": "\u201cMay God kill me if I don't execute Elisha this very day,\u201d the king vowed.", "32": "Elisha was sitting in his house at a meeting with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him. But before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, \u201cThis murderer has sent a man to kill me.

", "3": "Yet even so he didn't destroy the shrines on the hills\u2014the people still sacrificed and burned incense there.", "4-5": "One day King Joash said to Jehoiada, \u201cThe Temple building needs repairing. Whenever anyone brings a contribution to the Lord, whether it is a regular assessment or some special gift, use it to pay for whatever repairs are needed.\u201d", "6": "But in the twenty-third year of his reign the Temple was still in disrepair. ", "7": "So Joash called for Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them, \u201cWhy haven't you done anything about the Temple? Now don't use any more money for your own needs; from now on it must all be spent on getting the Temple into good condition.\u201d", "8": "So the priests agreed to set up a special repair fund that would not go through their hands, lest it be diverted to care for their personal needs.

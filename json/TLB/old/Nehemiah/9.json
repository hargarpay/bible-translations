These men were Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani.", "5": "Then the Levite leaders called out to the people, \u201cStand up and praise the Lord your God, for he lives from everlasting to everlasting.

Slaves among all this abundance! ", "37": "The lush yield of this land passes into the hands of the kings whom you have allowed to conquer us because of our sins.

And we're sitting here without doing a thing about it!\u201d", "4": "Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked him, \u201cWill you send your army with mine to recover Ramoth-gilead?\u201d And King Jehoshaphat of Judah replied, \u201cOf course! You and I are brothers; my people are yours to command, and my horses are at your service.

I'd like to ask him too.\u201d", "8": "\u201cWell, there's one,\u201d King Ahab replied, \u201cbut I hate him, for he never prophesies anything good. He always has something gloomy to say. His name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah.\u201d \u201cOh, come now!\u201d Jehoshaphat replied. \u201cDon't talk like that!\u201d", "9": "So King Ahab called to one of his aides, \u201cGo get Micaiah.

The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets, but the fact of the matter is that the Lord has decreed disaster upon you.\u201d", "24": "Then Zedekiah (son of Chenaanah) walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face. \u201cWhen did the Spirit of the Lord leave me and speak to you?\u201d he demanded.", "25": "And Micaiah replied, \u201cYou will have the answer to your question when you find yourself hiding in an inner room.\u201d", "26": "Then King Ahab ordered Micaiah's arrest. \u201cTake him to Amon, the mayor of the city, and to my son Joash.

She will lie in your arms and keep you warm.\u201d", "3-4": "So they searched the country from one end to the other to find the most beautiful girl in all the land. Abishag, from Shunam, was finally selected. They brought her to the king, and she lay in his arms to warm him (but he had no sexual relations with her).", "5": "At about that time, David's son[a] Adonijah (his mother was Haggith) decided to crown himself king in place of his aged father. So he hired chariots and drivers and recruited fifty men to run down the streets before him as royal footmen. ", "6": "Now his father, King David, had never disciplined him at any time\u2014not so much as by a single scolding! He was a very handsome man and was Absalom's younger brother. ", "7": "He took General Joab and Abiathar the priest into his confidence, and they agreed to help him become king.

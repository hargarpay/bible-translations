You know that Joab murdered my two generals, Abner and Amasa. He pretended that it was an act of war, but it was done in a time of peace.

Make them permanent guests of the king, for they took care of me when I fled from your brother Absalom. ", "8": "And do you remember Shimei, the son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim? He cursed me with a terrible curse as I was going to Mahanaim; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, I promised I wouldn't kill him. ", "9": "But that promise doesn't bind you! You are a wise man, and you will know how to arrange a bloody death for him.\u201d", "10": "Then David died and was buried in Jerusalem. ", "11": "He had reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. ", "12": "And Solomon became the new king, replacing his father David; and his kingdom prospered.", "13": "One day Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to see Solomon's mother, Bathsheba. \u201cHave you come to make trouble?\u201d she asked him. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cI come in peace.

But the tables are turned, and everything went to my brother instead; for that is the way the Lord wanted it. ", "16": "But now I have just a small favor to ask of you; please don't turn me down.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.", "17": "He replied, \u201cSpeak to King Solomon on my behalf (for I know he will do anything you request) and ask him to give me Abishag, the Shunammite, as my wife.\u201d", "18": "\u201cAll right,\u201d Bathsheba replied, \u201cI'll ask him.\u201d", "19": "So she went to ask the favor of King Solomon. The king stood up from his throne as she entered and bowed low to her.

For he is my older brother! He and Abiathar the priest and General Joab would take over!\u201d ", "23-24": "Then King Solomon swore with a great oath, \u201cMay God strike me dead if Adonijah does not die this very day for this plot against me! I swear it by the living God who has given me the throne of my father David and this kingdom he promised me.\u201d", "25": "So King Solomon sent Benaiah to execute him, and he killed him with a sword.", "26": "Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, \u201cGo back to your home in Anathoth. You should be killed, too, but I won't do it now. For you carried the Ark of the Lord during my father's reign, and you suffered right along with him in all of his troubles.\u201d", "27": "So Solomon forced Abiathar to give up his position as the priest of the Lord, thereby fulfilling the decree of Jehovah at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli.[a]", "28": "When Joab heard about Adonijah's death (Joab had joined Adonijah's revolt, though not Absalom's) he ran to the Tabernacle for sanctuary and caught hold of the horns of the altar.

So Solomon's grip upon the kingdom became secure."}

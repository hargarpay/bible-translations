{"1": "Now Naomi had an in-law there in Bethlehem who was a very wealthy man. His name was Boaz.", "2": "One day Ruth said to Naomi, \u201cPerhaps I can go out into the fields of some kind man to glean the free grain[a] behind his reapers.\u201d And Naomi said, \u201cAll right, dear daughter. Go ahead.\u201d", "3": "So she did. And as it happened, the field where she found herself belonged to Boaz, this relative of Naomi's husband.", "4-5": "Boaz arrived from the city while she was there. After exchanging greetings with the reapers he said to his foreman, \u201cHey, who's that girl over there?\u201d", "6": "And the foreman replied, \u201cIt's that girl from the land of Moab who came back with Naomi. ", "7": "She asked me this morning if she could pick up the grains dropped by the reapers, and she has been at it ever since except for a few minutes' rest over there in the shade.\u201d", "8-9": "Boaz went over and talked to her. \u201cListen, my child,\u201d he said to her. \u201cStay right here with us to glean; don't think of going to any other fields. Stay right behind my women workers; I have warned the young men not to bother you; when you are thirsty, go and help yourself to the water.\u201d", "10-11": "She thanked him warmly. \u201cHow can you be so kind to me?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou must know I am only a foreigner.\u201d \u201cYes, I know,\u201d Boaz replied, \u201cand I also know about all the love and kindness you have shown your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother in your own land and have come here to live among strangers. ", "12": "May the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge, bless you for it.\u201d", "13": "\u201cOh, thank you, sir,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou are so good to me, and I'm not even one of your workers!\u201d", "14": "At lunchtime Boaz called to her, \u201cCome and eat with us.\u201d So she sat with his reapers and he gave her food,[b] more than she could eat. ", "15": "And when she went back to work again, Boaz told his young men to let her glean right among the sheaves without stopping her, ", "16": "and to snap off some heads of barley and drop them on purpose for her to glean, and not to make any remarks. ", "17": "So she worked there all day, and in the evening when she had beaten out the barley she had gleaned, it came to a whole bushel! ", "18": "She carried it back into the city and gave it to her mother-in-law, with what was left of her lunch.", "19": "\u201cSo much!\u201d Naomi exclaimed. \u201cWhere in the world did you glean today? Praise the Lord for whoever was so kind to you.\u201d So Ruth told her mother-in-law all about it and mentioned that the owner of the field was Boaz.", "20": "\u201cPraise the Lord for a man like that! God has continued his kindness to us as well as to your dead husband!\u201d Naomi cried excitedly. \u201cWhy, that man is one of our closest relatives!\u201d[c]", "21": "\u201cWell,\u201d Ruth told her, \u201che said to come back and stay close behind his reapers until the entire field is harvested.\u201d", "22": "\u201cThis is wonderful!\u201d Naomi exclaimed. \u201cDo as he has said. Stay with his girls right through the whole harvest; you will be safer there than in any other field!\u201d", "23": "So Ruth did and gleaned with them until the end of the barley harvest, and then the wheat harvest too."}

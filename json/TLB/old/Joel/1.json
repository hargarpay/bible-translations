{"1": "This message came from the Lord to Joel, son of Pethuel:", "2": "Listen, you aged men of Israel! Everyone, listen! In all your lifetime, yes, in all your history, have you ever heard of such a thing as I am going to tell you? ", "3": "In years to come, tell your children about it; pass the awful story down from generation to generation. ", "4": "After the cutter-locusts finish eating your crops, the swarmer-locusts will take what's left! After them will come the hopper-locusts! And then the stripper-locusts too!", "5": "Wake up and weep, you drunkards, for all the grapes are ruined, and all your wine is gone! ", "6": "A vast army of locusts[a] covers the land. It is a terrible army too numerous to count, with teeth as sharp as those of lions! ", "7": "They have ruined my vines and stripped the bark from the fig trees, leaving trunks and branches white and bare.", "8": "Weep with sorrow, as a virgin weeps whose fianc\u00e9 is dead. ", "9": "Gone are the offerings of grain and wine to bring to the Temple of the Lord; the priests are starving. Hear the crying of these ministers of God. ", "10": "The fields are bare of crops. Sorrow and sadness are everywhere. The grain, the grapes, the olive oil are gone.", "11": "Well may you farmers stand so shocked and stricken; well may you vinedressers weep. Weep for the wheat and the barley, too, for they are gone. ", "12": "The grapevines are dead; the fig trees are dying; the pomegranates wither; the apples shrivel on the trees; all joy has withered with them.", "13": "O\u00a0priests, robe yourselves in sackcloth. O\u00a0ministers of my God, lie all night before the altar, weeping. For there are no more offerings of grain and wine for you. ", "14": "Announce a fast; call a solemn meeting. Gather the elders and all the people into the Temple of the Lord your God, and weep before him there.", "15": "Alas, this terrible day of punishment[b] is on the way. Destruction from the Almighty is almost here! ", "16": "Our food will disappear before our eyes; all joy and gladness will be ended in the Temple of our God. ", "17": "The seed rots in the ground; the barns and granaries are empty; the grain has dried up in the fields. ", "18": "The cattle groan with hunger; the herds stand perplexed, for there is no pasture for them; the sheep bleat in misery.", "19": "Lord, help us! For the heat has withered the pastures and burned up all the trees. ", "20": "Even the wild animals cry to you for help, for there is no water for them. The creeks are dry, and the pastures are scorched."}

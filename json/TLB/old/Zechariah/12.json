", "3": "Jerusalem will be a heavy stone burdening the world. And though all the nations of the earth unite in an attempt to move her, they will all be crushed.", "4": "\u201cIn that day,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cI will bewilder the armies drawn up against her, and make fools of them, for I will watch over the people of Judah, but blind all her enemies.", "5": "\u201cAnd the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, 'The people of Jerusalem have found strength in the Lord Almighty, their God.'", "6": "\u201cIn that day I will make the clans of Judah like a little fire that sets the forest aflame\u2014like a burning match among the sheaves; they will burn up all the neighboring nations right and left, while Jerusalem stands unmoved.

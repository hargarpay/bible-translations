", "3": "But he will turn again and favor you if only you return to him. ", "4": "Don't be like your fathers were! The earlier prophets pled in vain with them to turn from all their evil ways. \u201cCome, return to me,\u201d the Lord God said. But no, they wouldn't listen; they paid no attention at all.", "5-6": "Your fathers and their prophets are now long dead, but remember the lesson they learned, that God's Word endures! It caught up with them and punished them. Then at last they repented. \u201cWe have gotten what we deserved from God,\u201d they said. \u201cHe has done just what he warned us he would.\u201d", "7": "The following February, still in the second year of the reign of King Darius, another message from the Lord came to Zechariah (son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo the prophet), in a vision in the night: ", "8": "I saw a Man sitting on a red horse that was standing among the myrtle trees beside a river. Behind him were other horses, red and bay and white, each with its rider.[a]", "9": "An angel stood beside me, and I asked him, \u201cSir, what are all those horses for?\u201d \u201cI'll tell you,\u201d he replied.", "10": "Then the rider on the red horse\u2014he was the Angel of the Lord\u2014answered me, \u201cThe Lord has sent them to patrol the earth for him.\u201d", "11": "Then the other riders reported to the Angel of the Lord, \u201cWe have patrolled the whole earth, and everywhere there is prosperity and peace.\u201d", "12": "Upon hearing this, the Angel of the Lord prayed this prayer: \u201cO\u00a0Lord Almighty, for seventy years your anger has raged against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. How long will it be until you again show mercy to them?\u201d", "13": "And the Lord answered the angel who stood beside me, speaking words of comfort and assurance.", "14": "Then the angel said, \u201cShout out this message from the Lord Almighty: 'Don't you think I care about what has happened to Judah and Jerusalem?

", "2": "He complained to the Lord about it: \u201cThis is exactly what I thought you'd do, Lord, when I was there in my own country and you first told me to come here. That's why I ran away to Tarshish. For I knew you were a gracious God, merciful, slow to get angry, and full of kindness; I knew how easily you could cancel your plans for destroying these people.", "3": "\u201cPlease kill me, Lord; I'd rather be dead than alive when nothing that I told them happens.[a]\u201d", "4": "Then the Lord said, \u201cIs it right to be angry about this?\u201d", "5": "So Jonah went out and sat sulking[b] on the east side of the city, and he made a leafy shelter to shade him as he waited there to see if anything would happen to the city. ", "6": "And when the leaves of the shelter withered in the heat, the Lord arranged for a vine to grow up quickly and spread its broad leaves over Jonah's head to shade him. This made him comfortable and very grateful.", "7": "But God also prepared a worm! The next morning the worm ate through the stem of the plant, so that it withered away and died.", "8": "Then when the sun was hot, God ordered a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah, and the sun beat down upon his head until he grew faint and wished to die.

", "11": "And why shouldn't I feel sorry for a great city like Nineveh with its 120,000 people in utter spiritual darkness[c] and all its cattle?\u201d"}

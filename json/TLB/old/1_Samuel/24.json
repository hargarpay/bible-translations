", "3": "At the place where the road passes some sheepfolds, Saul went into a cave to go to the bathroom, but as it happened, David and his men were hiding in the cave!", "4": "\u201cNow's your time!\u201d David's men whispered to him. \u201cToday is the day the Lord was talking about when he said, 'I will certainly put Saul into your power, to do with as you wish'!\u201d Then David crept forward and quietly slit off the bottom of Saul's robe! ", "5": "But then his conscience began bothering him.", "6": "\u201cI shouldn't have done it,\u201d he said to his men. \u201cIt is a serious sin to attack God's chosen king in any way.\u201d", "7-8": "These words of David persuaded his men not to kill Saul. After Saul had left the cave and gone on his way, David came out and shouted after him, \u201cMy lord the king!\u201d And when Saul looked around, David bowed low before him.", "9-10": "Then he shouted to Saul, \u201cWhy do you listen to the people who say I am trying to harm you? This very day you have seen it isn't true. For the Lord placed you at my mercy back there in the cave, and some of my men told me to kill you, but I spared you. For I said, 'I will never harm him\u2014he is the Lord's chosen king.' ", "11": "See what I have in my hand? It is the hem of your robe! I cut it off, but I didn't kill you! Doesn't this convince you that I am not trying to harm you and that I have not sinned against you, even though you have been hunting for my life?", "12": "\u201cThe Lord will decide between us.

", "18": "Yes, you have been wonderfully kind to me today, for when the Lord delivered me into your hand, you didn't kill me. ", "19": "Who else in all the world would let his enemy get away when he had him in his power? May the Lord reward you well for the kindness you have shown me today. ", "20": "And now I realize that you are surely going to be king, and Israel shall be yours to rule.

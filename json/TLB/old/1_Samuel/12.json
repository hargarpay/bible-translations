", "3": "Now tell me as I stand before the Lord and before his anointed king\u2014whose ox or donkey have I stolen? Have I ever defrauded you? Have I ever oppressed you? Have I ever taken a bribe? Tell me and I will make right whatever I have done wrong.\u201d", "4": "\u201cNo,\u201d they replied, \u201cyou have never defrauded or oppressed us in any way and you have never taken even one single bribe.\u201d", "5": "\u201cThe Lord and his anointed king are my witnesses,\u201d Samuel declared, \u201cthat you can never accuse me of robbing you.\u201d \u201cYes, it is true,\u201d they replied.", "6": "\u201cIt was the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron,\u201d Samuel continued. \u201cHe brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt.", "7": "\u201cNow stand here quietly before the Lord as I remind you of all the good things he has done for you and for your ancestors:", "8": "\u201cWhen the Israelites were in Egypt and cried out to the Lord, he sent Moses and Aaron to bring them into this land.

But the Lord your God was already your King, for he has always been your King. ", "13": "All right, here is the king you have chosen. Look him over. You have asked for him, and the Lord has answered your request.", "14": "\u201cNow if you will fear and worship the Lord, and listen to his commandments and not rebel against the Lord, and if both you and your king follow the Lord your God, then all will be well.

He made you a special nation for himself\u2014just because he wanted to!", "23": "\u201cAs for me, I will certainly not sin against the Lord by ending my prayers for you; and I will continue to teach you those things which are good and right.", "24": "\u201cTrust the Lord and sincerely worship him; think of all the tremendous things he has done for you.

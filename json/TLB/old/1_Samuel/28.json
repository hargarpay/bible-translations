Saul disguised himself by wearing ordinary clothing instead of his royal robes. He went to the woman's home at night, accompanied by two of his men. \u201cI've got to talk to a dead man,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cWill you bring his spirit up?\u201d", "9": "\u201cAre you trying to get me killed?\u201d the woman demanded. \u201cYou know that Saul has had all of the mediums and fortune-tellers executed. You are spying on me.\u201d", "10": "But Saul took a solemn oath that he wouldn't betray her.", "11": "Finally the woman said, \u201cWell, whom do you want me to bring up?\u201d \u201cBring me Samuel,\u201d Saul replied.", "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, \u201cYou've deceived me!

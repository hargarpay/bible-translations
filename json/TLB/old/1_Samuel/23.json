{"1": "One day news came to David that the Philistines were at Keilah robbing the threshing floors.", "2": "David asked the Lord, \u201cShall I go and attack them?\u201d \u201cYes, go and save Keilah,\u201d the Lord told him.", "3": "But David's men said, \u201cWe're afraid even here in Judah; we certainly don't want to go to Keilah to fight the whole Philistine army!\u201d", "4": "David asked the Lord again, and the Lord again replied, \u201cGo down to Keilah, for I will help you conquer the Philistines.\u201d", "5": "They went to Keilah and slaughtered the Philistines and confiscated their cattle, and so the people of Keilah were saved. ", "6": "(Abiathar the priest went to Keilah with David, taking his ephod with him to get answers for David from the Lord.) ", "7": "Saul soon learned that David was at Keilah. \u201cGood!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe've got him now! God has delivered him to me, for he has trapped himself in a walled city!\u201d", "8": "So Saul mobilized his entire army to march to Keilah and besiege David and his men.

Word soon reached Saul that David had escaped, so he didn't go there after all. ", "14-15": "David now lived in the wilderness caves in the hill country of Ziph. One day near Horesh he received the news that Saul was on the way to Ziph to search for him and kill him.

And if he is in the area at all, I'll find him if I have to search every inch of the entire land!\u201d", "24-25": "So the men of Ziph returned home. But when David heard that Saul was on his way to Ziph, he and his men went even further into the wilderness of Maon in the south of the desert. But Saul followed them there.

", "3": "When they had all arrived and were standing before the monument, ", "4": "a herald shouted out, \u201cO\u00a0people of all nations and languages, this is the king's command:", "5": "\u201cWhen the band[a] strikes up, you are to fall flat on the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar's gold statue; ", "6": "anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a flaming furnace.\u201d", "7": "So when the band* began to play, everyone\u2014whatever his nation, language, or religion[b]\u2014fell to the ground and worshiped the statue.", "8": "But some officials went to the king and accused some of the Jews of refusing to worship!", "9": "\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d they said to him, ", "10": "\u201cyou made a law that everyone must fall down and worship the gold statue when the band* begins to play, ", "11": "and that anyone who refuses will be thrown into a flaming furnace.

And what god can deliver you out of my hands then?\u201d", "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, \u201cO\u00a0Nebuchadnezzar, we are not worried about what will happen to us. ", "17": "If we are thrown into the flaming furnace, our God is able to deliver us; and he will deliver us out of your hand, Your Majesty. ", "18": "But if he doesn't, please understand, sir, that even then we will never under any circumstance serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have erected.\u201d", "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury and his face became dark with anger at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He commanded that the furnace be heated up seven times hotter than usual, ", "20": "and called for some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and throw them into the fire. ", "21": "So they bound them tight with ropes and threw them into the furnace, fully clothed.

Come out! Come here!\u201d So they stepped out of the fire.", "27": "Then the princes, governors, captains, and counselors crowded around them and saw that the fire hadn't touched them\u2014not a hair of their heads was singed; their coats were unscorched, and they didn't even smell of smoke!", "28": "Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \u201cBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, for he sent his angel to deliver his trusting servants when they defied the king's commandment and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own. ", "29": "Therefore, I make this decree, that any person of any nation, language, or religion[d] who speaks a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and his house knocked into a heap of rubble. For no other God can do what this one does.\u201d", "30": "Then the king gave promotions to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so that they prospered greatly there in the province of Babylon."}

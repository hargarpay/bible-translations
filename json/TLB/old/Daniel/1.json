When he returned to Babylon, he took along some of the sacred cups from the Temple of God and placed them in the treasury of his god in the land of Shinar.", "3-4": "Then he ordered Ashpenaz, who was in charge of his palace personnel,[a] to select some of the Jewish youths brought back as captives\u2014young men of the royal family and nobility of Judah\u2014and to teach them the Chaldean language and literature.* \u201cPick strong, healthy, good-looking lads,\u201d he said; \u201cthose who have read widely in many fields, are well informed, alert and sensible, and have enough poise to look good around the palace.\u201d", "5": "The king assigned them the best of food and wine from his own kitchen during their three-year training period, planning to make them his counselors when they graduated.", "6": "Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah. ", "7": "However, their superintendent gave them Babylonian names, as follows: Daniel was called Belteshazzar; Hananiah was called Shadrach; Mishael was called Meshach; Azariah was called Abednego.", "8": "But Daniel made up his mind not to eat[b] the food and wine given to them by the king. He asked the superintendent for permission to eat other things instead.* ", "9": "Now as it happened, God had given the superintendent a special appreciation for Daniel and sympathy for his predicament. ", "10": "But he was alarmed by Daniel's suggestion. \u201cI'm afraid you will become pale and thin compared with the other youths your age,\u201d he said, \u201cand then the king will behead me for neglecting my responsibilities.\u201d", "11": "Daniel talked it over with the steward who was appointed by the superintendent to look after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, ", "12": "and suggested a ten-day diet of only vegetables and water; ", "13": "then, at the end of this trial period the steward could see how they looked in comparison with the other fellows who ate the king's rich food and decide whether or not to let them continue their diet.", "14": "The steward finally agreed to the test. ", "15": "Well, at the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the youths who had been eating the food supplied by the king!

", "2": "He got up early every morning and went out to the gate of the city; and when anyone came to bring a case to the king for trial, Absalom called him over and expressed interest in his problem.", "3": "He would say, \u201cI can see that you are right in this matter; it's unfortunate that the king doesn't have anyone to assist him in hearing these cases. ", "4": "I surely wish I were the judge; then anyone with a lawsuit could come to me, and I would give him justice!\u201d", "5": "And when anyone came to bow to him, Absalom wouldn't let him, but shook his hand instead![a] ", "6": "So in this way Absalom stole the hearts of all the people of Israel.", "7-8": "After four years, Absalom said to the king, \u201cLet me go to Hebron to sacrifice to the Lord in fulfillment of a vow I made to him while I was at Geshur\u2014that if he would bring me back to Jerusalem, I would sacrifice to him.\u201d", "9": "\u201cAll right,\u201d the king told him, \u201cgo and fulfill your vow.\u201d So Absalom went to Hebron.[b] ", "10": "But while he was there, he sent spies to every part of Israel to incite rebellion against the king. \u201cAs soon as you hear the trumpets,\u201d his message read, \u201cyou will know that Absalom has been crowned in Hebron.\u201d ", "11": "He took two hundred men from Jerusalem with him as guests, but they knew nothing of his intentions. ", "12": "While he was offering the sacrifice, he sent for Ahithophel, one of David's counselors who lived in Giloh. Ahithophel declared for Absalom, as did more and more others. So the conspiracy became very strong.", "13": "A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell King David, \u201cAll Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you!\u201d", "14": "\u201cThen we must flee at once or it will be too late!\u201d was David's instant response to his men. \u201cIf we get out of the city before he arrives, both we and the city of Jerusalem will be saved.\u201d", "15": "\u201cWe are with you,\u201d his aides replied. \u201cDo as you think best.\u201d", "16": "So the king and his household set out at once.

Go on back with your men to Jerusalem, to your king, for you are a guest in Israel, a foreigner in exile. It seems but yesterday that you arrived, and now today should I force you to wander with us, who knows where? Go on back and take your troops with you, and may the Lord be merciful to you.\u201d", "21": "But Ittai replied, \u201cI vow by God and by your own life that wherever you go, I will go, no matter what happens\u2014whether it means life or death.\u201d", "22": "So David replied, \u201cAll right, come with us.\u201d Then Ittai and his six hundred men and their families went along.", "23": "There was deep sadness throughout the city as the king and his retinue passed by, crossed Kidron Brook, and went out into the country. ", "24": "Abiathar and Zadok and the Levites took the Ark of the Covenant of God and set it down beside the road until everyone had passed. ", "25-26": "Then, following David's instructions, Zadok took the Ark back into the city. \u201cIf the Lord sees fit,\u201d David said, \u201che will bring me back to see the Ark and the Tabernacle again. But if he is through with me, well, let him do what seems best to him.\u201d", "27": "Then the king told Zadok, \u201cLook, here is my plan. Return quietly to the city with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. ", "28": "I will stop at the ford of the Jordan River and wait there for a message from you. Let me know what happens in Jerusalem before I disappear into the wilderness.\u201d", "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar carried the Ark of God back into the city and stayed there.", "30": "David walked up the road that led to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning. And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the mountain.

Then you can frustrate and counter Ahithophel's advice. ", "35-36": "Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, are there. Tell them the plans that are being made to capture me, and they will send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to find me and tell me what is going on.\u201d", "37": "So David's friend Hushai returned to the city, getting there just as Absalom arrived."}

{"1": "David was just past the top of the hill when Ziba, the manager of Mephibosheth's household, caught up with him. He was leading two donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred bunches of grapes, and a small barrel of wine.", "2": "\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d the king asked Ziba. And Ziba replied, \u201cThe donkeys are for your people to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat; the wine is to be taken with you into the wilderness for any who become faint.\u201d", "3": "\u201cAnd where is Mephibosheth?\u201d the king asked him. \u201cHe stayed at Jerusalem,\u201d Ziba replied. \u201cHe said, 'Now I'll get to be king! Today I will get back the kingdom of my father, Saul.'\u201d[a]", "4": "\u201cIn that case,\u201d the king told Ziba, \u201cI give you everything he owns.\u201d \u201cThank you, thank you, sir,\u201d Ziba replied.", "5": "As David and his party passed Bahurim, a man came out of the village cursing them. It was Shimei, the son of Gera, a member of Saul's family. ", "6": "He threw stones at the king and the king's officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded them!", "7-8": "\u201cGet out of here, you murderer, you scoundrel!\u201d he shouted at David. \u201cThe Lord is paying you back for murdering King Saul and his family; you stole his throne and now the Lord has given it to your son Absalom! At last you will taste some of your own medicine, you murderer!\u201d", "9": "\u201cWhy should this dead dog curse my lord the king?\u201d Abishai demanded. \u201cLet me go over and strike off his head!\u201d", "10": "\u201cNo!\u201d the king said. \u201cIf the Lord has told him to curse me, who am I to say no? ", "11": "My own son is trying to kill me, and this Benjaminite is merely cursing me. Leave him alone, for no doubt the Lord has told him to do it. ", "12": "And perhaps the Lord will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses.\u201d", "13": "So David and his men continued on, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing as he went and throwing stones at David and tossing dust into the air. ", "14": "The king and all those who were with him were weary by the time they reached Bahurim, so they stayed there awhile and rested.", "15": "Meanwhile, Absalom and his men arrived at Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel. ", "16": "When David's friend, Hushai the Archite, arrived, he went immediately to see Absalom. \u201cLong live the king!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cLong live the king!\u201d", "17": "\u201cIs this the way to treat your friend David?\u201d Absalom asked him. \u201cWhy aren't you with him?\u201d", "18": "\u201cBecause I work for the man who is chosen by the Lord and by Israel,\u201d Hushai replied. ", "19": "\u201cAnd anyway, why shouldn't I? I helped your father and now I will help you!\u201d", "20": "Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him, \u201cWhat shall I do next?\u201d", "21": "Ahithophel told him, \u201cGo and sleep with your father's wives, for he has left them here to keep the house. Then all Israel will know that you have insulted him beyond the possibility of reconciliation, and they will all close ranks behind you.\u201d[b]", "22": "So a tent was erected on the roof of the palace where everybody could see it, and Absalom went into the tent to lie with his father's wives. ", "23": "(Absalom did whatever Ahithophel told him to, just as David had; for every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God.)"}

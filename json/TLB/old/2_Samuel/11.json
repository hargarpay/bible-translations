But David stayed in Jerusalem.", "2": "One night he couldn't get to sleep[a] and went for a stroll on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking her evening bath. ", "3": "He sent to find out who she was and was told that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah. ", "4": "Then David sent for her and when she came he slept with her. (She had just completed the purification rites after menstruation.) Then she returned home. ", "5": "When she found that he had gotten her pregnant she sent a message to inform him.", "6": "So David dispatched a memo to Joab: \u201cSend me Uriah the Hittite.\u201d ", "7": "When he arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was prospering. ", "8": "Then he told him to go home and relax, and he sent a present to him at his home. ", "9": "But Uriah didn't go there. He stayed that night at the gateway of the palace with the other servants of the king.", "10": "When David heard what Uriah had done, he summoned him and asked him, \u201cWhat's the matter with you? Why didn't you go home to your wife last night after being away for so long?\u201d", "11": "Uriah replied, \u201cThe Ark and the armies and the general and his officers are camping out in open fields, and should I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife? I swear that I will never be guilty of acting like that.\u201d", "12": "\u201cWell, stay here tonight,\u201d David told him, \u201cand tomorrow you may return to the army.\u201d So Uriah stayed around the palace.

Didn't they know there would be shooting from the walls? Wasn't Abimelech killed at Thebez by a woman who threw down a millstone on him?'\u2014then tell him, 'Uriah was killed too.'\u201d", "22": "So the messenger arrived at Jerusalem and gave the report to David.", "23": "\u201cThe enemy came out against us,\u201d he said, \u201cand as we chased them back to the city gates, ", "24": "the men on the wall attacked us; and some of our men were killed, and Uriah the Hittite is dead too.\u201d", "25": "\u201cWell, tell Joab not to be discouraged,\u201d David said. \u201cThe sword kills one as well as another![b] Fight harder next time, and conquer the city; tell him he is doing well.\u201d", "26": "When Bathsheba heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him; ", "27": "then, when the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace and she became one of his wives; and she gave birth to his son.

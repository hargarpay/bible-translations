{"1": "David now appointed regimental colonels and company commanders over his troops. ", "2": "A third were placed under Joab's brother, Abishai (the son of Zeruiah); and a third under Ittai, the Gittite. The king planned to lead the army himself, but his men objected strongly.", "3": "\u201cYou mustn't do it,\u201d they said, \u201cfor if we have to turn and run, and half of us die, it will make no difference to them\u2014they will be looking only for you. You are worth ten thousand of us, and it is better that you stay here in the city and send us help if we need it.\u201d", "4": "\u201cWell, whatever you think best,\u201d the king finally replied. So he stood at the gate of the city as all the troops passed by.", "5": "And the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, \u201cFor my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.\u201d And all the troops heard the king give them this charge.", "6": "So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim, ", "7": "and the Israeli troops were beaten back by David's men. There was a great slaughter and twenty thousand men laid down their lives that day. ", "8": "The battle raged all across the countryside, and more men disappeared in the forest than were killed. ", "9": "During the battle Absalom came upon some of David's men and as he fled[a] on his mule, it went beneath the thick boughs of a great oak tree, and his hair caught in the branches. His mule went on, leaving him dangling in the air. ", "10": "One of David's men saw him and told Joab.", "11": "\u201cWhat? You saw him there and didn't kill him?\u201d Joab demanded. \u201cI would have rewarded you handsomely and made you a commissioned officer.\u201d[b]", "12": "\u201cFor a million dollars I wouldn't do it,\u201d the man replied. \u201cWe all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake, please don't harm young Absalom.' ", "13": "And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son (and the king would certainly find out who did it), you yourself would be the first to accuse me.\u201d", "14": "\u201cEnough of this nonsense,\u201d Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into the heart of Absalom as he dangled alive from the oak. ", "15": "Ten of Joab's young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and finished him off. ", "16": "Then Joab blew the trumpet, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel. ", "17": "They threw Absalom's body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And the army of Israel fled to their homes.", "18": "(Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King's Valley, for he said, \u201cI have no sons to carry on my name.\u201d He called it \u201cAbsalom's Monument,\u201d as it is still known today.)", "19": "Then Zadok's son Ahimaaz said, \u201cLet me run to King David with the good news that the Lord has saved him from his enemy Absalom.\u201d", "20": "\u201cNo,\u201d Joab told him, \u201cit wouldn't be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger some other time.\u201d", "21": "Then Joab said to a man from Cush, \u201cGo tell the king what you have seen.\u201d The man bowed and ran off.", "22": "But Ahimaaz pleaded with Joab, \u201cPlease let me go too.\u201d \u201cNo, we don't need you now, my boy,\u201d Joab replied. \u201cThere is no further news to send.\u201d", "23": "\u201cYes, but let me go anyway,\u201d he begged. And Joab finally said, \u201cAll right, go ahead.\u201d Then Ahimaaz took a shortcut across the plain and got there ahead of the man from Cush. ", "24": "David was sitting at the gate of the city. When the watchman climbed the stairs to his post at the top of the wall, he saw a lone man running toward them.", "25": "He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, \u201cIf he is alone, he has news.\u201d As the messenger came closer, ", "26": "the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, \u201cHere comes another one.\u201d And the king replied, \u201cHe will have more news.\u201d", "27": "\u201cThe first man looks like Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok,\u201d the watchman said. \u201cHe is a good man and comes with good news,\u201d the king replied.", "28": "Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, \u201cAll is well!\u201d He bowed low with his face to the ground and said, \u201cBlessed be the Lord your God who has destroyed the rebels who dared to stand against you.\u201d", "29": "\u201cWhat of young Absalom?\u201d the king demanded. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d \u201cWhen Joab told me to come, there was a lot of shouting; but I didn't know what was happening,\u201d[c] Ahimaaz answered.", "30": "\u201cWait here,\u201d the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.", "31": "Then the man from Cush arrived and said, \u201cI have good news for my lord the king. Today Jehovah has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you.\u201d", "32": "\u201cWhat about young Absalom? Is he all right?\u201d the king demanded. And the man replied, \u201cMay all of your enemies be as that young man is!\u201d", "33": "Then the king broke into tears, and went up to his room over the gate, crying as he went. \u201cO\u00a0my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom.

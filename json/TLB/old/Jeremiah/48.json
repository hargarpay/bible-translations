Tell it by the banks of the Arnon, that Moab is destroyed.\u201d", "21": "All the cities of the tableland lie in ruins too, for God's judgment has been poured out upon them all\u2014on Holon and Jahzah and Mephaath, ", "22": "and Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim, ", "23": "and Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon, ", "24": "and Kerioth and Bozrah\u2014and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.", "25": "The strength of Moab is ended\u2014her horns are cut off; her arms are broken.

For the destroyer has cut off your spreading tendrils and harvested your grapes and summer fruits. He has plucked you bare! ", "33": "Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab. The presses yield no wine; no one treads the grapes with shouts of joy. There is shouting, yes, but not the shouting of joy. ", "34": "Instead the awful cries of terror and pain rise from all over the land\u2014from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and to Jahaz; from Zoar to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah. The pastures of Nimrim are deserted now.", "35": "For the Lord says: I have put a stop to Moab's worshiping false gods and burning incense to idols. ", "36": "Sadly sings my heart for Moab and Kir-heres, for all their wealth has disappeared.

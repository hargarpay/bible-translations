", "2": "Oh, that I could go away and forget them and live in some wayside shack in the desert, for they are all adulterous, treacherous men.", "3": "\u201cThey bend their tongues like bows to shoot their arrows of untruth.

Gone is the lowing of cattle, gone the birds and wild animals. All have fled.", "11": "\u201cAnd I will turn Jerusalem into heaps of ruined houses where only jackals have their dens. The cities of Judah shall be ghost towns, with no one living in them.\u201d", "12": "Who is wise enough to understand all this? Where is the Lord's messenger to explain it?

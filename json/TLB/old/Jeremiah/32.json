{"1": "The following message came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah (which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign). ", "2": "At this time Jeremiah was imprisoned in the dungeon beneath the palace,[a] while the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem. ", "3": "King Zedekiah had put him there for continuing to prophesy that the city would be conquered by the king of Babylon, ", "4": "and that King Zedekiah would be caught and taken as a prisoner before the king of Babylon for trial and sentencing.", "5": "\u201cHe shall take you to Babylon and imprison you there for many years until you die. Why fight the facts? You can't win! Surrender now!\u201d Jeremiah had told him again and again.", "6-7": "Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah: Your cousin Hanamel (son of Shallum) will soon arrive to ask you to buy the farm he owns in Anathoth, for by law you have a chance to buy before it is offered to anyone else.", "8": "So Hanamel came, as the Lord had said he would, and visited me in the prison. \u201cBuy my field in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the law gives you the first right to purchase it.\u201d Then I knew for sure that the message I had heard was really from the Lord.", "9": "So I bought the field, paying Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver. ", "10": "I signed and sealed the deed of purchase before witnesses, weighed out the silver, and paid him. ", "11": "Then I took the sealed deed containing the terms and conditions and also the unsealed copy, ", "12": "and publicly, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who had signed the deed, and as the prison guards watched, I handed the papers to Baruch (son of Neriah, who was the son of Mahseiah).

", "15": "For the Lord, God of Israel, says: In the future these papers will be valuable.[b] Someday people will again own property here in this country and will be buying and selling houses and vineyards and fields.\u201d", "16": "Then after I had given the papers to Baruch I prayed: ", "17": "\u201cO\u00a0Lord God! You have made the heavens and earth by your great power; nothing is too hard for you! ", "18": "You are loving and kind to thousands, yet children suffer for their fathers' sins; you are the great and mighty God, the Lord Almighty. ", "19": "You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles; for your eyes are open to all the ways of men, and you reward everyone according to his life and deeds. ", "20": "You have done incredible things in the land of Egypt\u2014things still remembered to this day. And you have continued to do great miracles in Israel and all around the world. You have made your name very great, as it is today.", "21": "\u201cYou brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty miracles and great power and terror.

", "30": "For Israel and Judah have done nothing but wrong since their earliest days; they have infuriated me with all their evil deeds. ", "31": "From the time this city was built until now, it has done nothing but anger me; so I am determined to be rid of it.", "32": "The sins of Israel and Judah\u2014the sins of the people, of their kings, officers, priests, and prophets\u2014stir me up. ", "33": "They have turned their backs upon me and refused to return; day after day, year after year, I taught them right from wrong, but they would not listen or obey. ", "34": "They have even defiled my own Temple by worshiping their abominable idols there. ", "35": "And they have built high altars to Baal in the valley of Hinnom. There they have burnt their children as sacrifices to Molech\u2014something I never commanded and cannot imagine suggesting. What an incredible evil, causing Judah to sin so greatly!", "36": "Now therefore the Lord God of Israel says concerning this city that it will fall to the king of Babylon through warfare, famine, and disease, ", "37": "but I will bring my people back again from all the countries where in my fury I will scatter them.

", "42": "Just as I have sent all these terrors and evils upon them, so will I do all the good I have promised them.", "43": "Fields will again be bought and sold in this land now ravaged by the Babylonians, where men and animals alike have disappeared. ", "44": "Yes, fields shall once again be bought and sold\u2014deeds signed and sealed and witnessed\u2014in the country of Benjamin and here in Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah and in the hill country, in the Philistine Plain and in the Negeb too, for some day I will restore prosperity to them."}

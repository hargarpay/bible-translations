", "3": "Then the Lord's message came to me again. This time he said, ", "4": "Take the loincloth out to the Euphrates River and hide it in a hole in the rocks.", "5": "So I did; I hid it as the Lord had told me to. ", "6": "Then, a long time afterwards, the Lord said: Go out to the river again and get the loincloth. ", "7": "And I did; I dug it out of the hole where I had hidden it. But now it was mildewed and falling apart. It was utterly useless!", "8-9": "Then the Lord said: This illustrates the way that I will rot the pride of Judah and Jerusalem. ", "10": "This evil nation refuses to listen to me and follows its own evil desires, and worships idols; therefore, it shall become as this loincloth\u2014good for nothing. ", "11": "Even as a loincloth clings to a man's loins, so I made Judah and Israel to cling to me, says the Lord. They were my people, an honor to my name. But then they turned away.", "12": "Tell them this: The Lord God of Israel says, All your wine jugs will be full of wine. And they will reply, Of course, you don't need to tell us how prosperous we will be![a] ", "13": "Then tell them: That's not what I mean.[b] I mean that I will fill everyone living in this land with helpless bewilderment\u2014from the king sitting on David's throne, and the priests and the prophets, right on down to all the people. ", "14": "And I will smash fathers and sons against each other, says the Lord. I will not let pity nor mercy spare them from utter destruction.", "15": "Oh, that you were not so proud and stubborn! Then you would listen to the Lord, for he has spoken.

My eyes will overflow with tears because the Lord's flock shall be carried away as slaves.", "18": "Say to the king and queen mother,[c] Come down from your thrones and sit in the dust, for your glorious crowns are removed from your heads. They are no longer yours. ", "19": "The cities of the Negeb to the south of Jerusalem have closed their gates against the enemy.

You will writhe in pain like a woman having a child. ", "22": "And if you ask yourself, Why is all this happening to me? It is because of the grossness of your sins; that is why you have been raped and destroyed by the invading army.

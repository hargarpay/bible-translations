Because of all their wickedness they lie in heaps and ashes, without a living soul. For my anger rose high against them for worshiping other gods\u2014\u201cgods\u201d that neither they nor you nor any of your fathers have ever known.", "4": "I sent my servants, the prophets, to protest over and over again and to plead with them not to do this horrible thing I hate, ", "5": "but they wouldn't listen and wouldn't turn back from their wicked ways; they have kept right on with their sacrifices to these \u201cgods.\u201d ", "6": "And so my fury and anger boiled over and fell as fire upon the cities of Judah and into the streets of Jerusalem, and there is desolation until this day.", "7": "And now the Lord, the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, asks you: Why are you destroying yourselves? For not one of you shall live\u2014not a man, woman, or child among you who has come here from Judah, not even the babies in arms. ", "8": "For you are rousing my anger with the idols you have made and worshiped here in Egypt, burning incense to them, and causing me to destroy you completely and to make you a curse and a stench in the nostrils of all the nations of the earth. ", "9": "Have you forgotten the sins of your fathers, the sins of the kings and queens of Judah, your own sins, and the sins of your wives in Judah and Jerusalem? ", "10": "And even until this very hour there has been no apology; no one has wanted to return to me or follow the laws I gave you and your fathers before you.", "11": "Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There is fury in my face and I will destroy every one of you!

They shall fall here in Egypt, killed by famine and sword; all shall die, from the least important to the greatest. They shall be despised and loathed, cursed and hated. ", "13": "I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem, by sword, famine, and disease. ", "14": "Not one of them shall escape from my wrath except those who repent of their coming and escape from the others by returning again to their own land.", "15": "Then all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to idols (it was a great crowd of all the Jews in southern Egypt) answered Jeremiah:", "16": "\u201cWe will not listen to your false 'Messages from God'!

We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven[a] and sacrifice to her just as much as we like\u2014just as we and our fathers before us, and our kings and princes have always done in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for in those days we had plenty to eat, and we were well off and happy!

Of course not!\u201d", "20": "Then Jeremiah said to all of them, men and women alike, who had given him that answer:", "21": "\u201cDo you think the Lord didn't know that you and your fathers, your kings and princes, and all the people were burning incense to idols in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? ", "22": "It was because he could no longer bear all the evil things you were doing that he made your land desolate, an incredible ruin, cursed, without an inhabitant, as it is today.

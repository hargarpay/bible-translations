For these people have sinned against the Lord. That is why it happened. ", "4": "Now I am going to take off your chains and let you go. If you want to come with me to Babylon, fine; I will see that you are well cared for. But if you don't want to come, don't. The world is before you\u2014go where you like. ", "5": "If you decide to stay, then return to Gedaliah, who has been appointed as governor of Judah by the king of Babylon, and stay with the remnant he rules. But it's up to you; go where you like.\u201d Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some food and money and let him go. ", "6": "So Jeremiah returned to Gedaliah and lived in Judah with the people left in the land.", "7": "Now when the leaders of the Jewish guerrilla bands in the countryside heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over the poor of the land who were left behind, and had not exiled everyone to Babylon, ", "8": "they came to see Gedaliah at Mizpah, where his headquarters were. These are the names of the leaders who came: Ishmael (son of Nethaniah), Johanan and Jonathan (sons of Kareah), Seraiah (son of Tanhumeth), the sons of Ephai (the Netophathite), Jezaniah (son of a Maacathite), and their men.

Johanan volunteered to kill Ishmael secretly. \u201cWhy should we let him come and murder you?\u201d Johanan asked. \u201cWhat will happen then to the Jews who have returned? Why should this remnant be scattered and lost?\u201d", "16": "But Gedaliah said, \u201cI forbid you to do any such thing, for you are lying about Ishmael.\u201d"}

Judge them, O\u00a0God!", "4": "How long must this land of yours put up with all their goings-on? Even the grass of the field groans and weeps over their wicked deeds! The wild animals and birds have moved away, leaving the land deserted. Yet the people say, \u201cGod won't bring judgment on us. We're perfectly safe!\u201d", "5": "The Lord replied to me: If racing with mere men\u2014these men of Anathoth\u2014has wearied you, how will you race against horses, against the king, his court, and all his evil priests?[b] If you stumble and fall on open ground, what will you do in Jordan's jungles?

Tell them the Lord says: Those who are destined for death, to death; those who must die by the sword, to the sword; those doomed to starvation, to famine; and those for captivity, to captivity. ", "3": "I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, says the Lord: the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, and the vultures and wild animals to finish up what's left. ", "4": "Because of the wicked things Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will punish you so severely that your fate will horrify the peoples of the world.", "5": "Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem? Who will weep for you? Who will even bother to ask how you are? ", "6": "You have forsaken me and turned your backs upon me. Therefore, I will clench my fists against you to destroy you.

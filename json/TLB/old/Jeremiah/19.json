Take some of the elders of the people and some of the older priests with you, and speak to them whatever words I give you.", "3": "Then the Lord spoke to them and said: Listen to the word of the Lord, kings of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem! The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will bring terrible evil upon this place, so terrible that the ears of those who hear it will prickle.

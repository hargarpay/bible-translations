That kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few soldiers we have left, and of all the people too. This man is a traitor.\u201d", "5": "So King Zedekiah agreed. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cDo as you like\u2014I can't stop you.\u201d", "6": "They took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into an empty cistern in the prison yard.

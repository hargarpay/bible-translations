", "3": "Jehoshaphat was badly shaken by this news and determined to beg for help from the Lord; so he announced that all the people of Judah should go without food for a time, in penitence and intercession before God. ", "4": "People from all across the nation came to Jerusalem to plead unitedly with him. ", "5": "Jehoshaphat stood among them as they gathered at the new court of the Temple and prayed this prayer:", "6": "\u201cO\u00a0Lord God of our fathers\u2014the only God in all the heavens, the ruler of all the kingdoms of the earth\u2014you are so powerful, so mighty. Who can stand against you? ", "7": "O\u00a0our God, didn't you drive out the heathen who lived in this land when your people arrived? And didn't you give this land forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham?

We don't know what to do, but we are looking to you.\u201d", "13": "As the people from every part of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, wives, and children, ", "14": "the Spirit of the Lord came upon one of the men standing there\u2014Jahaziel (son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah the Levite, who was one of the sons of Asaph).", "15": "\u201cListen to me, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem, and you, O\u00a0king Jehoshaphat!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThe Lord says, 'Don't be afraid! Don't be paralyzed by this mighty army! For the battle is not yours, but God's! ", "16": "Tomorrow, go down and attack them! You will find them coming up the slopes of Ziz at the end of the valley that opens into the wilderness of Jeruel. ", "17": "But you will not need to fight! Take your places; stand quietly and see the incredible rescue operation God will perform for you, O\u00a0people of Judah and Jerusalem! Don't be afraid or discouraged! Go out there tomorrow, for the Lord is with you!'\u201d", "18": "Then King Jehoshaphat fell to the ground with his face to the earth, and all the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem did the same, worshiping the Lord. ", "19": "Then the Levites of the Kohath clan and the Korah clan stood to praise the Lord God of Israel with songs of praise that rang out strong and clear.", "20": "Early the next morning the army of Judah went out into the wilderness of Tekoa.

", "23": "For the Ammonites and Moabites turned against their allies from Mount Seir and killed every one of them. And when they had finished that job, they turned against each other!

", "25": "King Jehoshaphat and his people went out to plunder the bodies and came away loaded with money, garments, and jewels stripped from the corpses\u2014so much that it took them three days to cart it all away! ", "26": "On the fourth day they gathered in the Valley of Blessing, as it is called today, and how they praised the Lord!", "27": "Then they returned to Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat leading them, full of joy that the Lord had given them this marvelous rescue from their enemies. ", "28": "They marched into Jerusalem accompanied by a band of harps, lyres, and trumpets and proceeded to the Temple.

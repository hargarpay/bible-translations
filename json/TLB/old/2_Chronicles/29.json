", "7": "The doors have been shut tight, the perpetual flame has been put out, and the incense and burnt offerings have not been offered. ", "8": "Therefore, the wrath of the Lord has been upon Judah and Jerusalem. He has caused us to be objects of horror, amazement, and contempt, as you see us today.

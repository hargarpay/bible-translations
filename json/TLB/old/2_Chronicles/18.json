{"1": "But rich, popular King Jehoshaphat of Judah made a marriage alliance for his son[a] with the daughter of* King Ahab of Israel. ", "2": "A few years later he went down to Samaria to visit King Ahab, and King Ahab gave a great party for him and his aides, butchering great numbers of sheep and oxen for the feast. Then he asked King Jehoshaphat to join forces with him against Ramoth-gilead.", "3-5": "\u201cWhy, of course!\u201d King Jehoshaphat replied. \u201cI'm with you all the way. My troops are at your command! However, let's check with the Lord first.\u201d So King Ahab summoned 400 of his heathen prophets and asked them, \u201cShall we go to war with Ramoth-gilead or not?\u201d And they replied, \u201cGo ahead, for God will give you a great victory!\u201d", "6-7": "But Jehoshaphat wasn't satisfied. \u201cIsn't there some prophet of the Lord around here too?\u201d he asked. \u201cI'd like to ask him the same question.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Ahab told him, \u201cthere is one, but I hate him, for he never prophesies anything but evil! His name is Micaiah (son of Imlah).\u201d \u201cOh, come now, don't talk like that!\u201d Jehoshaphat exclaimed. \u201cLet's hear what he has to say.\u201d", "8": "So the king of Israel called one of his aides. \u201cQuick! Go and get Micaiah (son of Imlah),\u201d he ordered.", "9": "The two kings were sitting on thrones in full regalia at an open place near the Samaria gate, and all the \u201cprophets\u201d were prophesying before them.

It will be a glorious victory!\u201d", "15": "\u201cLook here,\u201d the king said sharply, \u201chow many times must I tell you to speak nothing except what the Lord tells you to?\u201d", "16": "Then Micaiah told him, \u201cIn my vision I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountain as sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'Their master has been killed. Send them home.'\u201d", "17": "\u201cDidn't I tell you?\u201d the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. \u201cHe does it every time. He never prophesies anything but evil against me.\u201d", "18": "\u201cListen to what else the Lord has told me,\u201d Micaiah continued. \u201cI saw him upon his throne surrounded by vast throngs of angels.", "19-20": "\u201cAnd the Lord said, 'Who can get King Ahab to go to battle against Ramoth-gilead and be killed there?' \u201cThere were many suggestions, but finally a spirit stepped forward before the Lord and said, 'I can do it!' \u201c'How?' the Lord asked him.", "21": "\u201cHe replied, 'I will be a lying spirit in the mouths of all of the king's prophets!' \u201c'It will work,' the Lord said; 'go and do it.'", "22": "\u201cSo you see, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, when actually he has determined just the opposite of what they are telling you!\u201d", "23": "Then Zedekiah (son of Chenaanah) walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. \u201cYou liar!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWhen did the Spirit of the Lord leave me and enter you?\u201d", "24": "\u201cYou'll find out soon enough,\u201d Micaiah replied, \u201cwhen you are hiding in an inner room!\u201d", "25": "\u201cArrest this man and take him back to Governor Amon and to my son Joash,\u201d the king of Israel ordered.

But Jehoshaphat cried out to the Lord to save him, and the Lord made the charioteers see their mistake and leave him. ", "32": "For as soon as they realized he was not the king of Israel, they stopped chasing him. ", "33": "But one of the Syrian soldiers shot an arrow haphazardly at the Israeli troops, and it struck the king of Israel at the opening where the lower armor and the breastplate meet. \u201cGet me out of here,\u201d he groaned to the driver of his chariot, \u201cfor I am badly wounded.\u201d ", "34": "The battle grew hotter and hotter all that day, and King Ahab went back in, propped up in his chariot, to fight the Syrians, but just as the sun sank into the western skies, he died."}

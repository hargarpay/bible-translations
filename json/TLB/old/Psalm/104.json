{"1-2": "I bless the Lord: O\u00a0Lord my God, how great you are! You are robed with honor and with majesty and light! You stretched out the starry curtain of the heavens, ", "3": "and hollowed out the surface of the earth to form the seas. The clouds are his chariots. He rides upon the wings of the wind. ", "4": "The angels[a] are his messengers\u2014his servants of fire!", "5": "You bound the world together so that it would never fall apart. ", "6": "You clothed the earth with floods of waters covering up the mountains. ", "7-8": "You spoke, and at the sound of your shout the water collected into its vast ocean beds, and mountains rose and valleys sank to the levels you decreed. ", "9": "And then you set a boundary for the seas so that they would never again cover the earth.", "10": "He placed springs in the valleys and streams that gush from the mountains. ", "11": "They give water for all the animals to drink. There the wild donkeys quench their thirst, ", "12": "and the birds nest beside the streams and sing among the branches of the trees. ", "13": "He sends rain upon the mountains and fills the earth with fruit. ", "14": "The tender grass grows up at his command to feed the cattle, and there are fruit trees, vegetables, and grain for man to cultivate, ", "15": "and wine to make him glad, and olive oil as lotion for his skin, and bread to give him strength. ", "16": "The Lord planted the cedars of Lebanon. They are tall and flourishing. ", "17": "There the birds make their nests, the storks in the firs. ", "18": "High in the mountains are pastures for the wild goats, and rock badgers burrow in among the rocks and find protection there.", "19": "He assigned the moon to mark the months and the sun to mark the days. ", "20": "He sends the night and darkness, when all the forest folk come out. ", "21": "Then the young lions roar for their food, but they are dependent on the Lord. ", "22": "At dawn they slink back into their dens to rest, ", "23": "and men go off to work until the evening shadows fall again. ", "24": "O\u00a0Lord, what a variety you have made! And in wisdom you have made them all! The earth is full of your riches.", "25": "There before me lies the mighty ocean, teeming with life of every kind, both great and small. ", "26": "And look! See the ships! And over there, the whale you made to play in the sea. ", "27": "Every one of these depends on you to give them daily food. ", "28": "You supply it, and they gather it. You open wide your hand to feed them, and they are satisfied with all your bountiful provision.", "29": "But if you turn away from them, then all is lost. And when you gather up their breath, they die and turn again to dust.", "30": "Then you send your Spirit, and new life is born[b] to replenish all the living of the earth. ", "31": "Praise God forever! How he must rejoice in all his work! ", "32": "The earth trembles at his glance; the mountains burst into flame at his touch.", "33": "I will sing to the Lord as long as I live. I will praise God to my last breath! ", "34": "May he be pleased by all these thoughts about him, for he is the source of all my joy. ", "35": "Let all sinners perish\u2014all who refuse to praise him. But I will praise him. Hallelujah!"}

{"1": "Bless the Lord who is my immovable Rock. He gives me strength and skill in battle. ", "2": "He is always kind and loving to me; he is my fortress, my tower of strength and safety, my deliverer. He stands before me as a shield. He subdues my people under me.", "3": "O\u00a0Lord, what is man that you even notice him? Why bother at all with the human race?[a] ", "4": "For man is but a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.", "5": "Bend down the heavens, Lord, and come. The mountains smoke beneath your touch.", "6": "Let loose your lightning bolts, your arrows, Lord, upon your enemies, and scatter them.", "7": "Reach down from heaven and rescue me; deliver me from deep waters, from the power of my enemies. ", "8": "Their mouths are filled with lies; they swear to the truth of what is false.", "9": "I will sing you a new song, O\u00a0God, with a ten-stringed harp. ", "10": "For you grant victory to kings! You are the one who will rescue your servant David from the fatal sword. ", "11": "Save me! Deliver me from these enemies, these liars, these treacherous men.", "12-15": "Here is my description of[b] a truly happy land where Jehovah is God: Sons vigorous and tall as growing plants. Daughters of graceful beauty like the pillars of a palace wall. Barns full to the brim with crops of every kind. Sheep by the thousands out in our fields. Oxen loaded down with produce. No enemy attacking the walls, but peace everywhere. No crime in our streets. Yes, happy are those whose God is Jehovah."}

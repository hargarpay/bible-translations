{"1": "This song of David was written at a time when the Lord had delivered him from his many enemies, including Saul. Lord, how I love you! For you have done such tremendous things for me.", "2": "The Lord is my fort where I can enter and be safe; no one can follow me in and slay me. He is a rugged mountain where I hide; he is my Savior, a rock where none can reach me, and a tower of safety. He is my shield. He is like the strong horn of a mighty fighting bull. ", "3": "All I need to do is cry to him\u2014oh, praise the Lord\u2014and I am saved from all my enemies!", "4": "Death bound me with chains, and the floods of ungodliness mounted a massive attack against me. ", "5": "Trapped and helpless, I struggled against the ropes that drew me on to death.", "6": "In my distress I screamed to the Lord for his help. And he heard me from heaven;[a] my cry reached his ears. ", "7": "Then the earth rocked and reeled, and mountains shook and trembled. How they quaked! For he was angry. ", "8": "Fierce flames leaped from his mouth, setting fire to the earth;[b] smoke blew from his nostrils. ", "9": "He bent the heavens down and came to my defense;[c] thick darkness was beneath his feet. ", "10": "Mounted on a mighty angel,[d] he sped swiftly to my aid with wings of wind. ", "11": "He enshrouded himself with darkness, veiling his approach with dense clouds dark as murky waters. ", "12": "Suddenly the brilliance of his presence broke through the clouds with lightning[e] and a mighty storm of hail.", "13": "The Lord thundered in the heavens; the God above all gods has spoken\u2014oh, the hailstones; oh, the fire! ", "14": "He flashed his fearful arrows of lightning and routed all my enemies. See how they run! ", "15": "Then at your command, O\u00a0Lord, the sea receded from the shore. At the blast of your breath the depths were laid bare.", "16": "He reached down from heaven and took me and drew me out of my great trials. He rescued me from deep waters. ", "17": "He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me\u2014I who was helpless in their hands.", "18": "On the day when I was weakest, they attacked. But the Lord held me steady. ", "19": "He led me to a place of safety, for he delights in me.", "20": "The Lord rewarded me for doing right and being pure. ", "21": "For I have followed his commands and have not sinned by turning back from following him. ", "22": "I kept close watch on all his laws; I did not refuse a single one. ", "23": "I did my best to keep them all, holding myself back from doing wrong. ", "24": "And so the Lord has paid me with his blessings, for I have done what is right, and I am pure of heart. This he knows, for he watches my every step.", "25": "Lord, how merciful you are to those who are merciful. And you do not punish those who run from evil.[f] ", "26": "You give blessings to the pure but pain to those who leave your paths. ", "27": "You deliver the humble but condemn the proud and haughty ones. ", "28": "You have turned on my light! The Lord my God has made my darkness turn to light. ", "29": "Now in your strength I can scale any wall, attack any troop.", "30": "What a God he is! How perfect in every way! All his promises prove true. He is a shield for everyone who hides behind him. ", "31": "For who is God except our Lord? Who but he is as a rock?", "32": "He fills me with strength and protects me wherever I go. ", "33": "He gives me the surefootedness of a mountain goat upon the crags. He leads me safely along the top of the cliffs. ", "34": "He prepares me for battle and gives me strength to draw an iron bow![g]", "35": "You have given me your salvation as my shield. Your right hand, O\u00a0Lord, supports me; your gentleness has made me great. ", "36": "You have made wide steps beneath my feet so that I need never slip. ", "37": "I chased my enemies; I caught up with them and did not turn back until all were conquered. ", "38": "I pinned them to the ground; all were helpless before me. I placed my feet upon their necks. ", "39": "For you have armed me with strong armor for the battle. My enemies quail before me and fall defeated at my feet. ", "40": "You made them turn and run; I destroyed all who hated me. ", "41": "They shouted for help, but no one dared to rescue them; they cried to the Lord, but he refused to answer them. ", "42": "So I crushed them fine as dust and cast them to the wind. I threw them away like sweepings from the floor. ", "43-45": "You gave me victory in every battle. The nations came and served me. Even those I didn't know before come now and bow before me. Foreigners who have never seen me submit instantly. They come trembling from their strongholds.", "46": "God is alive! Praise him who is the great rock of protection. ", "47": "He is the God who pays back those who harm me and subdues the nations before me.", "48": "He rescues me from my enemies; he holds me safely out of their reach and saves me from these powerful opponents. ", "49": "For this, O\u00a0Lord, I will praise you among the nations. ", "50": "Many times you have miraculously rescued me, the king you appointed. You have been loving and kind to me and will be to my descendants."}

", "4": "I will reveal these truths to you so that you can describe these glorious deeds of Jehovah to your children and tell them about the mighty miracles he did. ", "5": "For he gave his laws to Israel and commanded our fathers to teach them to their children, ", "6": "so that they in turn could teach their children too. Thus his laws pass down from generation to generation. ", "7": "In this way each generation has been able to obey his laws and to set its hope anew on God and not forget his glorious miracles. ", "8": "Thus they did not need to be as their fathers were\u2014stubborn, rebellious, unfaithful, refusing to give their hearts to God.", "9": "The people of Ephraim, though fully armed, turned their backs and fled when the day of battle came ", "10": "because they didn't obey his laws. They refused to follow his ways. ", "11-12": "And they forgot about the wonderful miracles God had done for them and for their fathers in Egypt. ", "13": "For he divided the sea before them and led them through! The water stood banked up along both sides of them! ", "14": "In the daytime he led them by a cloud, and at night by a pillar of fire. ", "15": "He split open the rocks in the wilderness to give them plenty of water, as though gushing from a spring. ", "16": "Streams poured from the rock, flowing like a river!", "17": "Yet they kept on with their rebellion, sinning against the God who is above all gods. ", "18": "They murmured and complained, demanding other food than God was giving them. ", "19-20": "They even spoke against God himself. \u201cWhy can't he give us decent food as well as water?\u201d they grumbled. ", "21": "Jehovah heard them and was angry; the fire of his wrath burned against Israel ", "22": "because they didn't believe in God or trust in him to care for them, ", "23": "even though he commanded the skies to open\u2014he opened the windows of heaven\u2014", "24": "and rained down manna for their food. He gave them bread from heaven! ", "25": "They ate angels' food! He gave them all they could hold.", "26": "And he led forth the east wind and guided the south wind by his mighty power. ", "27": "He rained down birds as thick as dust, clouds of them like sands along the shore! ", "28": "He caused the birds to fall to the ground among the tents. ", "29": "The people ate their fill. He gave them what they asked for. ", "30": "But they had hardly finished eating, and the meat was yet in their mouths, ", "31": "when the anger of the Lord rose against them and killed the finest of Israel's young men. ", "32": "Yet even so the people kept on sinning and refused to believe in miracles. ", "33": "So he cut their lives short and gave them years of terror and disaster.", "34": "Then at last, when he had ruined them, they walked awhile behind him; how earnestly they turned around and followed him! ", "35": "Then they remembered that God was their Rock\u2014that their Savior was the God above all gods. ", "36": "But it was only with their words that they followed him, not with their hearts; ", "37": "their hearts were far away. They did not keep their promises. ", "38": "Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins and didn't destroy them all. Many and many a time he held back his anger. ", "39": "For he remembered that they were merely mortal men, gone in a moment like a breath of wind.", "40": "Oh, how often they rebelled against him in those desert years and grieved his heart. ", "41": "Again and again they turned away and tempted God to kill them, and limited the Holy One of Israel from giving them his blessings. ", "42": "They forgot his power and love and how he had rescued them from their enemies; ", "43": "they forgot the plagues he sent upon the Egyptians in Tanis[a]\u2014", "44": "how he turned their rivers into blood so that no one could drink, ", "45": "how he sent vast swarms of flies to fill the land, and how the frogs had covered all of Egypt!", "46": "He gave their crops to caterpillars. Their harvest was consumed by locusts. ", "47": "He destroyed their grapevines and their sycamores with hail. ", "48": "Their cattle died in the fields, mortally wounded by huge hailstones from heaven. Their sheep were killed by lightning. ", "49": "He loosed on them the fierceness of his anger, sending sorrow and trouble. He dispatched against them a band of destroying angels. ", "50": "He gave free course to his anger and did not spare the Egyptians' lives, but handed them over to plagues and sickness. ", "51": "Then he killed the eldest son[b] in each Egyptian family\u2014he who was the beginning of its strength and joy.", "52": "But he led forth his own people like a flock, guiding them safely through the wilderness. ", "53": "He kept them safe, so they were not afraid. But the sea closed in upon their enemies and overwhelmed them. ", "54": "He brought them to the border of his land of blessing, to this land of hills he made for them. ", "55": "He drove out the nations occupying the land and gave each tribe of Israel its apportioned place as its home.", "56": "Yet though he did all this for them, they still rebelled against the God above all gods and refused to follow his commands. ", "57": "They turned back from entering the Promised Land and disobeyed as their fathers had. Like a crooked arrow, they missed the target of God's will. ", "58": "They made him angry by erecting idols and altars to other gods.", "59": "When God saw their deeds, his wrath was strong and he despised his people. ", "60": "Then he abandoned his Tabernacle at Shiloh, where he had lived among mankind, ", "61": "and allowed his Ark to be captured; he surrendered his glory into enemy hands. ", "62": "He caused his people to be butchered because his anger was intense. ", "63": "Their young men were killed by fire, and their girls died before they were old enough to sing their wedding songs. ", "64": "The priests were slaughtered, and their widows died before they could even begin their lament. ", "65": "Then the Lord rose up as though awakening from sleep, and like a mighty man aroused by wine, ", "66": "he routed his enemies; he drove them back and sent them to eternal shame. ", "67": "But he rejected Joseph's family, the tribe of Ephraim, ", "68": "and chose the tribe of Judah\u2014and Mount Zion, which he loved. ", "69": "There he built his towering temple, solid and enduring as the heavens and the earth. ", "70": "He chose his servant David, taking him from feeding sheep ", "71-72": "and from following the ewes with lambs; God presented David to his people as their shepherd, and he cared for them with a true heart and skillful hands."}

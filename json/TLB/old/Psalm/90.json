{"1": "A prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, through all the generations you have been our home! ", "2": "Before the mountains were created, before the earth was formed, you are God without beginning or end.", "3": "You speak, and man turns back to dust. ", "4": "A thousand years are but as yesterday to you! They are like a single hour![a] ", "5-6": "We glide along the tides of time as swiftly as a racing river and vanish as quickly as a dream. We are like grass that is green in the morning but mowed down and withered before the evening shadows fall. ", "7": "We die beneath your anger; we are overwhelmed by your wrath. ", "8": "You spread out our sins before you\u2014our secret sins\u2014and see them all. ", "9": "No wonder the years are long and heavy here beneath your wrath. All our days are filled with sighing.", "10": "Seventy years are given us! And some may even live to eighty. But even the best of these years are often empty and filled with pain; soon they disappear, and we are gone. ", "11": "Who can realize the terrors of your anger? Which of us can fear you as he should?", "12": "Teach us to number our days and recognize how few they are; help us to spend them as we should.", "13": "O\u00a0Jehovah, come and bless us!

May he give permanence to all we do."}

If it seems slow,[b] do not despair, for these things will surely come to pass. Just be patient! They will not be overdue a single day!", "4": "\u201cNote this: Wicked men trust themselves alone as these Chaldeans do,[c] and fail; but the righteous man trusts in me and lives!* ", "5": "What's more, these arrogant Chaldeans are betrayed by all their wine, for it is treacherous. In their greed they have collected many nations, but like death and hell, they are never satisfied. ", "6": "The time is coming when all their captives will taunt them, saying: 'You robbers! At last justice has caught up with you! Now you will get your just deserts for your oppression and extortion!'", "7": "\u201cSuddenly your debtors will rise up in anger and turn on you and take all you have, while you stand trembling and helpless.

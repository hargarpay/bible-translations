I shout to you in vain; there is no answer. \u201cHelp! Murder!\u201d I cry, but no one comes to save. ", "3": "Must I forever see this sin and sadness all around me? Wherever I look I see oppression and bribery and men who love to argue and to fight. ", "4": "The law is not enforced, and there is no justice given in the courts, for the wicked far outnumber the righteous, and bribes and trickery prevail.", "5": "The Lord replied: \u201cLook, and be amazed! You will be astounded at what I am about to do! For I am going to do something in your own lifetime that you will have to see to believe.

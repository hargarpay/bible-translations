", "2": "I will send an Angel before you to drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. ", "3": "It is a land 'flowing with milk and honey'; but I will not travel among you, for you are a stubborn, unruly people, and I would be tempted to destroy you along the way.\u201d", "4": "When the people heard these stern words, they went into mourning and stripped themselves of their jewelry and ornaments.", "5": "For the Lord had told Moses to tell them, \u201cYou are an unruly, stubborn people. If I were there among you for even a moment, I would exterminate you. Remove your jewelry and ornaments until I decide what to do with you.\u201d ", "6": "So, after that, they wore no jewelry.", "7": "Moses always erected the sacred tent (the \u201cTent for Meeting with God,\u201d he called it) far outside the camp, and everyone who wanted to consult with Jehovah went out there.", "8": "Whenever Moses went to the Tabernacle, all the people, when they saw it, stood and would rise and stand in their tent doors. ", "9": "As he entered, the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the door while the Lord spoke with Moses.

Afterwards Moses would return to the camp, but the young man who assisted him, Joshua (son of Nun), stayed behind in the Tabernacle.", "12": "Moses talked there with the Lord and said to him, \u201cYou have been telling me, 'Take these people to the Promised Land,' but you haven't told me whom you will send with me. You say you are my friend,[a] and that I have found favor before you; ", "13": "please, if this is really so, guide me clearly along the way you want me to travel[b] so that I will understand you and walk acceptably before you.

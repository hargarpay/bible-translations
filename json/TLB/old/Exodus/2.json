{"1-2": "There were at this time a Hebrew fellow and girl of the tribe of Levi who married and had a family, and a baby son was born to them. When the baby's mother saw that he was an unusually beautiful baby, she hid him at home for three months. ", "3": "Then, when she could no longer hide him, she made a little boat from papyrus reeds, waterproofed it with tar, put the baby in it, and laid it among the reeds along the river's edge. ", "4": "The baby's sister watched from a distance to see what would happen to him.", "5": "Well, this is what happened: A princess, one of Pharaoh's daughters, came down to bathe in the river, and as she and her maids were walking along the riverbank, she spied the little boat among the reeds and sent one of the maids to bring it to her. ", "6": "When she opened it, there was a baby! And he was crying. This touched her heart. \u201cHe must be one of the Hebrew children!\u201d she said.", "7": "Then the baby's sister approached the princess and asked her, \u201cShall I go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?\u201d", "8": "\u201cYes, do!\u201d the princess replied. So the little girl rushed home and called her mother!", "9": "\u201cTake this child home and nurse him for me,\u201d the princess instructed the baby's mother, \u201cand I will pay you well!\u201d So she took him home and nursed him.", "10": "Later, when he was older, she brought him back to the princess and he became her son. She named him Moses (meaning \u201cto draw out\u201d[a]) because she had drawn him out of the water.", "11": "One day, many years later[b] when Moses had grown up and become a man, he went out to visit his fellow Hebrews and saw the terrible conditions they were under. During his visit he saw an Egyptian knock a Hebrew to the ground\u2014one of his own Hebrew brothers! ", "12": "Moses looked this way and that to be sure no one was watching, then killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.", "13": "The next day as he was out visiting among the Hebrews again, he saw two of them fighting. \u201cWhat are you doing, hitting your own Hebrew brother like that?\u201d he said to the one in the wrong.", "14": "\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d the man demanded. \u201cI suppose you think you are our prince and judge! And do you plan to kill me as you did that Egyptian yesterday?\u201d When Moses realized that his deed was known, he was frightened.

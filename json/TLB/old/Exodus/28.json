", "3": "Instruct those to whom I have given special skill as tailors to make the garments that will set him apart from others, so that he may minister to me in the priest's office. ", "4": "This is the wardrobe they shall make: a chestpiece, an ephod,[a] a robe, an embroidered shirt, a turban, and a sash. They shall also make special garments for Aaron's sons.", "5-6": "\u201cThe ephod shall be made by the most skilled of the workmen, using gold, blue, purple, and scarlet threads of fine linen. ", "7": "It will consist of two pieces, front and back, joined at the shoulders. ", "8": "And the sash shall be made of the same material\u2014threads of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet fine-twined linen. ", "9": "Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the tribes of Israel. ", "10": "Six names shall be on each stone, so that all the tribes are named in the order of their births.

", "13-14": "Two chains of pure, twisted gold shall be made and attached to gold clasps on the shoulder of the ephod.", "15": "\u201cThen, using the most careful workmanship, make a chestpiece to be used as God's oracle; use the same gold, blue, purple, and scarlet threads of fine-twined linen as you did in the ephod.

It shall have a woven band around this opening, just as on the neck of a coat of mail, so that it will not fray.

", "41": "Clothe Aaron and his sons with these garments, and then dedicate these men to their ministry by anointing their heads with olive oil, thus sanctifying them as the priests, my ministers.

", "43": "These are to be worn whenever Aaron and his sons go into the Tabernacle or to the altar in the Holy Place, lest they be guilty and die. This is a permanent ordinance for Aaron and his sons."}

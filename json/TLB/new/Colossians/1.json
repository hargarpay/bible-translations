May God our Father shower you with blessings and fill you with his great peace.", "3": "Whenever we pray for you, we always begin by giving thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, ", "4": "for we have heard how much you trust the\u00a0Lord, and how much you love his people. ", "5": "And you are looking forward to the joys of heaven, and have been ever since the Gospel first was preached to you. ", "6": "The same Good News that came to you is going out all over the world and changing lives everywhere, just as it changed yours that very first day you heard it and understood about God's great kindness to sinners.", "7": "Epaphras, our much-loved fellow worker, was the one who brought you this Good News. He is Jesus Christ's faithful slave, here to help us in your place. ", "8": "And he is the one who has told us about the great love for others that the Holy Spirit has given you.", "9": "So ever since we first heard about you we have kept on praying and asking God to help you understand what he wants you to do; asking him to make you wise about spiritual things; ", "10": "and asking that the way you live will always please the Lord and honor him, so that you will always be doing good, kind things for others, while all the time you are learning to know God better and better.", "11": "We are praying, too, that you will be filled with his mighty, glorious strength so that you can keep going no matter what happens\u2014always full of the joy of the Lord, ", "12": "and always thankful to the Father who has made us fit to share all the wonderful things that belong to those who live in the Kingdom of light.

He existed before God made anything at all,[a] and, in fact, ", "16": "Christ himself is the Creator who made everything in heaven and earth, the things we can see and the things we can't; the spirit world with its kings and kingdoms, its rulers and authorities; all were made by Christ for his own use and glory. ", "17": "He was before all else began and it is his power that holds everything together. ", "18": "He is the Head of the body made up of his people\u2014that is, his Church\u2014which he began; and he is the Leader of all those who arise from the dead,[b] so that he is first in everything; ", "19": "for God wanted all of himself to be in his Son.", "20": "It was through what his Son did that God cleared a path for everything to come to him\u2014all things in heaven and on earth\u2014for Christ's death on the cross has made peace with God for all by his blood.

And this is the secret: Christ in your hearts is your only hope of glory.", "28": "So everywhere we go we talk about Christ to all who will listen, warning them and teaching them as well as we know how. We want to be able to present each one to God, perfect because of what Christ has done for each of them.

", "2": "Be full of love for others, following the example of Christ who loved you and gave himself to God as a sacrifice to take away your sins. And God\u00a0was pleased, for Christ's love for you was like sweet perfume to him.", "3": "Let there be no sex sin, impurity or greed among you. Let no one be able to accuse you of any such things. ", "4": "Dirty stories, foul talk, and coarse jokes\u2014these are not for you. Instead, remind each other of God's goodness, and be thankful.", "5": "You can be sure of this: The Kingdom of Christ and of God will never belong to anyone who is impure or greedy, for a greedy person is really an idol worshiper\u2014he loves and worships the good things of this life more than God. ", "6": "Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the terrible wrath of God is upon all those who do them. ", "7": "Don't even associate with such people. ", "8": "For though once your heart was full of darkness, now it is full of light from the Lord, and your behavior should show it!

", "12": "It\u00a0would be shameful even to mention here those pleasures of darkness that\u00a0the\u00a0ungodly do. ", "13": "But when you expose them, the light shines in upon their sin and shows it up, and when they see how wrong they really are, some\u00a0of them may even become children of light! ", "14": "That is why God says in the Scriptures, \u201cAwake, O\u00a0sleeper, and rise up from the dead; and Christ shall give you light.\u201d", "15-16": "So be careful how you act; these are difficult days. Don't be fools; be wise: make the most of every opportunity you have for doing good. ", "17": "Don't act thoughtlessly, but try to find out and do whatever the Lord wants you to. ", "18": "Don't drink too much wine, for many evils lie along that path; be filled instead with the Holy Spirit and controlled by him.", "19": "Talk with each other much about the Lord, quoting psalms and hymns and singing sacred songs, making music in your hearts to the Lord. ", "20": "Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.", "21": "Honor Christ by submitting to each other. ", "22": "You wives must submit to your\u00a0husbands' leadership in the same way you submit to the Lord. ", "23": "For a\u00a0husband is in charge of his wife in the same way Christ is in charge of his body the Church. (He gave his very life to take care of it and be its Savior!) ", "24": "So you wives must willingly obey your husbands in everything, just as the Church obeys Christ.", "25": "And you husbands, show the same kind of love to your wives as Christ showed to the Church when he died for her, ", "26": "to make her holy and clean, washed by baptism and God's Word;[b] ", "27": "so that he could give her to himself as a glorious Church without a single spot or wrinkle or any other blemish, being holy and without a single fault.

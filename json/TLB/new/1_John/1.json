{"1": "Christ was alive when the world began, yet I myself have seen him with my own\u00a0eyes and listened to him speak. I have touched him with my own hands. He is God's message of life. ", "2": "This one who is life from God has been shown to us, and we guarantee that we have seen him; I am speaking of Christ, who is eternal Life. He was with the Father and then was shown to us. ", "3": "Again I say, we are telling you about what we ourselves have actually seen and heard, so that you may share the fellowship and the joys we have with the Father and with Jesus Christ his son. ", "4": "And if you do as I say in this letter, then you, too, will be full of joy, and so will we.", "5": "This is the message God has given us to pass on to you: that God is Light and in him is no darkness at all. ", "6": "So if we say we are his friends but go on living in spiritual darkness and sin, we are lying. ", "7": "But if we are living in the light of God's presence, just as Christ does, then we have wonderful fellowship and joy with each other, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from every sin.", "8": "If we say that we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and refusing to accept the truth. ", "9": "But if we confess our sins to him,[a] he can be depended on to forgive us and to cleanse us from every wrong. And it is perfectly proper for God to do this for us because Christ died to wash away our sins.* ", "10": "If we claim we have not sinned, we are lying and calling God a liar, for he says we have sinned."}

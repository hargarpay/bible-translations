{"1": "Since we have such a huge crowd of men of faith watching us from the grandstands, let us strip off anything that slows us down or holds us back, and especially those sins that wrap themselves so tightly around our feet and trip us up; and let us run with patience the particular race that God has set before us.", "2": "Keep your eyes on Jesus, our leader and instructor. He was willing to die a shameful death on the cross because of the joy he knew would be his afterwards; and now he sits in the place of honor by the throne of God.", "3": "If you want to keep from becoming fainthearted and weary, think about his patience as sinful men did such terrible things to him. ", "4": "After all, you have never yet struggled against sin and temptation until you sweat great drops of blood.", "5": "And have you quite forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you, his child? He said, \u201cMy son, don't be angry when the Lord punishes you. Don't be discouraged when he has to show you where you are wrong. ", "6": "For when he punishes you, it proves that he loves you. When he whips you, it proves you are really his child.\u201d", "7": "Let God train you, for he is doing what any loving father does for his children. Whoever heard of a son who was never corrected? ", "8": "If God doesn't punish you when you need it, as other fathers punish their sons, then it means that you aren't really God's son at all\u2014that you don't really belong in his family. ", "9": "Since we respect our fathers here on earth, though they punish us, should we not all the more cheerfully submit to God's training so that we can begin really to live?", "10": "Our earthly fathers trained us for a few brief years, doing the best for us that they knew how, but God's correction is always right and for our best good, that we may share his holiness. ", "11": "Being punished isn't enjoyable while it is happening\u2014it hurts! But afterwards we can see the result, a quiet growth in grace and character.", "12": "So take a new grip with your tired hands, stand firm on your shaky legs, ", "13": "and mark out a straight, smooth path for your feet so that those who follow you, though weak and lame, will not fall and hurt themselves but become strong.", "14": "Try to stay out of all quarrels, and seek to live a clean and holy life, for one who is not holy will not see the Lord. ", "15": "Look after each other so that not one of you will fail to find God's best blessings. Watch out that no bitterness takes root among you, for as it springs up it causes deep trouble, hurting many in their spiritual lives. ", "16": "Watch out that no one becomes involved in sexual sin or becomes careless about God as Esau did: he traded his rights as the oldest son for a single meal. ", "17": "And afterwards, when he wanted those rights back again, it was too late, even though he wept bitter tears of repentance. So remember, and be careful.", "18": "You have not had to stand face to face with terror, flaming fire, gloom, darkness, and a terrible storm as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai when God gave them his laws. ", "19": "For there was an awesome trumpet blast and a voice with a message so terrible that the people begged God to stop speaking. ", "20": "They\u00a0staggered back under God's command that if even an animal touched the mountain it must die. ", "21": "Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he shook with terrible fear.", "22": "But you have come right up into Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the gathering of countless happy angels; ", "23": "and\u00a0to the church, composed of all those registered in heaven; and to God who is Judge of all; and to the spirits of the redeemed in heaven, already made perfect; ", "24": "and to Jesus himself, who has brought us his wonderful new agreement; and to the sprinkled blood, which graciously forgives instead of crying out for vengeance as the blood of Abel did.", "25": "So see to it that you obey him who is speaking to you. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, how terrible our danger if we refuse to listen to God who speaks to us from heaven! ", "26": "When he spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth, but, \u201cNext time,\u201d he says, \u201cI will not only shake the earth but the heavens too.\u201d\u00a0", "27": "By this he means that he will sift out everything without solid foundations so that only unshakable things will be left.", "28": "Since we have a Kingdom nothing can destroy, let us please God by serving him with thankful hearts and with holy fear and awe. ", "29": "For our God is a consuming fire."}

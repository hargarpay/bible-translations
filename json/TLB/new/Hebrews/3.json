{"1": "Therefore, dear brothers whom God has set apart for himself\u2014you who are chosen for heaven\u2014I want you to think now about this Jesus who is God's Messenger and the High Priest of our faith.", "2": "For Jesus was faithful to God who appointed him High Priest, just as Moses also faithfully served in God's house. ", "3": "But Jesus has far more glory than Moses, just as a man who builds a fine house gets more praise than his house does. ", "4": "And many people can build houses, but only God made everything.", "5": "Well, Moses did a fine job working in God's house, but he was only a servant; and his work was mostly to illustrate and suggest those things that would happen later on. ", "6": "But Christ, God's faithful Son, is in complete charge of God's house. And we Christians are God's house\u2014he lives in us!\u2014if we keep up our courage firm to the end, and our joy and our trust in the Lord.", "7-8": "And since Christ is so much superior, the Holy Spirit warns us to listen to him, to be careful to hear his voice today and not let our hearts become set against him, as the people of Israel did. They steeled themselves against his love and complained against him in the desert while he was testing them. ", "9": "But\u00a0God was patient with them forty years, though they tried his patience sorely; he kept right on doing his mighty miracles for them to see. ", "10": "\u201cBut,\u201d God says, \u201cI was very angry with them, for their hearts were always looking somewhere else instead of up to me, and they never found the paths I wanted them to follow.\u201d", "11": "Then God, full of this anger against them, bound himself with an oath that he would never let them come to his place of rest.", "12": "Beware then of your own hearts, dear brothers, lest you find that they, too, are evil and unbelieving and are leading you away from the living God. ", "13": "Speak to each other about these things every day while there is still time so that none of you will become hardened against God, being blinded by the glamor[a] of sin. ", "14": "For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as we did when we first became Christians, we will share in all that belongs to Christ.", "15": "But now is the time. Never forget the warning, \u201cToday if you hear God's voice speaking to you, do not harden your hearts against him, as the people of Israel did when they rebelled against him in the desert.\u201d", "16": "And who were those people I speak of, who heard God's voice speaking to them but then rebelled against him? They were the ones who came out of Egypt with Moses their leader. ", "17": "And who was it who made God angry for all those forty years? These same people who sinned and as a result died in the wilderness. ", "18": "And to whom was God speaking when he swore with an oath that they could never go into the land he had promised his people? He was speaking to all those who disobeyed him. ", "19": "And why couldn't they go in? Because they didn't trust him."}

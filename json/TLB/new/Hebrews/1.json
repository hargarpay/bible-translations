{"1": "Long ago God spoke in many different ways to our fathers through the prophets, in visions, dreams, and even face to face,[a] telling them little by little about his plans.", "2": "But now in these days he has spoken to us through his Son to whom he has given everything and through whom he made the world and everything there is.", "3": "God's Son shines out with God's glory, and all that God's Son is and does marks him as God. He regulates the universe by the mighty power of his command. He is the one who died to cleanse us and clear our record of all sin, and then sat down in highest honor beside the great God of heaven.", "4": "Thus he became far greater than the angels, as proved by the fact that his name \u201cSon of God,\u201d which was passed on to him from his Father, is far greater than the names and titles of the angels. ", "5-6": "For God never said to any angel, \u201cYou are my Son, and today I have given you the honor that goes with that name.\u201d[b] But God said it about Jesus. Another time he said, \u201cI am his Father and he is my Son.\u201d And still another time\u2014when his firstborn Son came to earth\u2014God said, \u201cLet all the angels of God worship him.\u201d", "7": "God speaks of his angels as messengers swift as the wind and as servants made of flaming fire; ", "8": "but of his Son he says, \u201cYour Kingdom, O\u00a0God, will last forever and ever; its commands are always just and right.

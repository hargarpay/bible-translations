{"1-2": "Let me add this, dear brothers: You already know how to please God in your daily living, for you know the commands we gave you from the Lord Jesus himself. Now we beg you\u2014yes, we demand of you in the name of the Lord Jesus\u2014that you live more and more closely to that ideal. ", "3-4": "For God wants you to be holy and pure and to keep clear of all sexual sin so that each of you will marry in holiness and honor\u2014", "5": "not in lustful passion as the heathen do, in their ignorance of God and his ways.", "6": "And this also is God's will: that you never cheat in this matter by taking another man's wife because the Lord will punish you terribly for this, as we have solemnly told you before. ", "7": "For God has not called us to be dirty-minded and full of lust but to be holy and clean. ", "8": "If anyone refuses to live by these rules, he is not disobeying the rules of men but of God who gives his Holy Spirit to you.", "9": "But concerning the pure brotherly love that there should be among God's people, I don't need to say very much, I'm sure! For God himself is teaching you to love one another. ", "10": "Indeed, your love is already strong toward all the Christian brothers throughout your whole nation. Even so, dear friends, we beg you to love them more and more. ", "11": "This should be your ambition: to live a quiet life, minding your own business and doing your own work, just as we told you before. ", "12": "As a result, people who are not Christians will trust and respect you, and you will not need to depend on others for enough money to pay your bills.", "13": "And now, dear brothers, I want you to know what happens to a Christian when he dies so that when it happens, you will not be full of sorrow, as those are who have no hope.

", "16": "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a mighty shout and with the soul-stirring cry of the archangel and the great trumpet-call of God. And the believers who are dead will be the first to rise to meet the Lord. ", "17": "Then we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with him forever. ", "18": "So comfort and encourage each other with this news."}

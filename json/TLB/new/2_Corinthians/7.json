{"1": "Having such great promises as these, dear friends, let us turn away from everything wrong, whether of body or spirit, and purify ourselves, living in the wholesome fear of God, giving ourselves to him alone. ", "2": "Please open your hearts to us again, for not one of you has suffered any wrong from us. Not one of you was led\u00a0astray. We have cheated no one nor taken advantage of anyone. ", "3": "I'm not saying this to scold or blame you, for, as I have said before, you are in my heart forever, and I live and die with you. ", "4": "I have the highest confidence in you, and my pride in you is great. You have greatly encouraged me; you have made me so happy in spite of all my suffering.", "5": "When we arrived in Macedonia there was no rest for us; outside, trouble was on every hand and all around us; within us, our hearts were full of dread and fear. ", "6": "Then God who cheers those who are discouraged refreshed us by the arrival of Titus. ", "7": "Not only was his presence a joy, but also the news that he brought of the wonderful time he had with you. When he told me how much you were looking forward to my visit, and how sorry you were about what had happened, and about your loyalty and warm love for me, well, I overflowed with joy!", "8": "I am no longer sorry that I sent that letter to you, though I was very sorry for a time, realizing how painful it would be to you. But it hurt you only for a little while. ", "9": "Now I am glad I sent it, not because it hurt you but because the pain turned you to God. It was a good kind of sorrow you felt, the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have, so that I need not come to you with harshness. ", "10": "For God sometimes uses sorrow in our lives to help us turn away from sin and seek eternal life. We should never regret his sending it. But the sorrow of the man who is not a Christian is not the sorrow of true repentance and\u00a0does not prevent eternal death.", "11": "Just see how much good this grief from the Lord did for you! You no longer shrugged your shoulders but became earnest and sincere and very anxious to get rid of the sin that I wrote you about. You became frightened about what had happened and longed for me to come and help. You went right to work on the problem and cleared it up, punishing the man who sinned.[a] You have done everything you could to make it right.", "12": "I wrote as I did so the Lord could show how much you really do care for us. That was my purpose even more than to help the man who sinned or his father to whom he did the wrong.", "13": "In addition to the encouragement you gave us by your love, we were made happier still by Titus' joy when you gave him such a fine welcome and set his mind at ease. ", "14": "I told him how it would be\u2014told him before he left me of my pride in you\u2014and you didn't disappoint me. I have always told you the truth and now my boasting to Titus has also proved true! ", "15": "He loves you more than ever when he remembers the way you listened to him so willingly and received him so anxiously and with such deep concern. ", "16": "How happy this makes me, now that I am sure all is well between us again. Once again I can have perfect confidence in you."}

", "2": "For people will love only themselves and their money; they will be proud and boastful, sneering at God, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful to them, and thoroughly bad. ", "3": "They will be hardheaded and never give in to others; they will be constant liars and troublemakers and will think nothing of immorality. They will be rough and cruel, and sneer at those who try to be good. ", "4": "They will betray their friends; they will be hotheaded, puffed\u00a0up with pride, and prefer good times to worshiping God. ", "5": "They will go to church,[a] yes, but they won't really believe anything they hear. Don't be taken in\u00a0by people like that.", "6": "They are the kind who craftily sneak into other people's homes and make friendships with silly, sin-burdened women and teach them their new doctrines. ", "7": "Women of that kind are forever following new teachers, but they never understand the truth. ", "8": "And these teachers fight truth just as Jannes and Jambres fought against Moses. They have dirty minds, warped and twisted, and have turned against the Christian faith.", "9": "But they won't get away with all this forever.

You know they are true, for you know that you can trust those of us who have taught you. ", "15": "You know how, when you were a small child, you were taught the holy Scriptures; and it is these that make you wise to accept God's salvation by trusting in Christ Jesus. ", "16": "The whole Bible[b] was given to us by inspiration from God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives; it straightens us out and helps us do what is right.

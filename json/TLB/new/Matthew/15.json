", "4": "For instance, God's law is 'Honor your father and mother; anyone who reviles his parents must die.' ", "5-6": "But you say, 'Even if your parents are in need, you may give their support money to the church[a] instead.' And so, by your man-made rule, you nullify the direct command of God to honor and care for your parents. ", "7": "You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, ", "8": "'These people say they honor me, but their hearts are far away.

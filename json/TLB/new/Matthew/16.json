{"1": "One day the Pharisees and Sadducees[a] came to test Jesus' claim of being the Messiah by asking him to show them some great demonstrations in the skies.", "2-3": "He replied, \u201cYou are good at reading the weather signs of the skies\u2014red sky tonight means fair weather tomorrow; red sky in the morning means foul weather all day\u2014but you can't read the obvious signs of the times! ", "4": "This evil, unbelieving nation is asking for some strange sign in the heavens, but no further proof will be given except the miracle that happened to Jonah.\u201d Then Jesus walked out on them.", "5": "Arriving across the lake, the disciples discovered they had forgotten to bring any food.", "6": "\u201cWatch out!\u201d Jesus warned them. \u201cBeware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d", "7": "They thought he was saying this because they had forgotten to bring bread.", "8": "Jesus knew what they were thinking and told them, \u201cO\u00a0men of little faith! Why are you so worried about having no food? ", "9": "Won't you ever understand? Don't you remember at all the five thousand I fed with five loaves, and the basketfuls left over? ", "10": "Don't you remember the four thousand I fed, and all that was left? ", "11": "How could you even think I was talking about food? But again I say, 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'\u201d", "12": "Then at last they understood that by yeast he meant the wrong teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.", "13": "When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \u201cWho are the people saying I[b] am?\u201d", "14": "\u201cWell,\u201d they replied, \u201csome say John the Baptist; some, Elijah; some, Jeremiah or one of the other prophets.\u201d", "15": "Then he asked them, \u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d", "16": "Simon Peter answered, \u201cThe Christ, the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\u201d", "17": "\u201cGod has blessed you, Simon, son of Jonah,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cfor my Father in heaven has personally revealed this to you\u2014this is not from any human source. ", "18": "You are Peter, a stone; and upon this rock I will build my church; and all the powers of hell shall not prevail against it. ", "19": "And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; whatever doors you lock on earth shall be locked in heaven; and whatever doors you open on earth shall be open in heaven!\u201d", "20": "Then he warned the disciples against telling others that he was the Messiah.", "21": "From then on Jesus began to speak plainly to his disciples about going to Jerusalem, and what would happen to him there\u2014that he would suffer at the hands of the Jewish leaders,[c] that he would be killed, and that three days later he would be raised to life again.", "22": "But Peter took him aside to remonstrate with him. \u201cHeaven forbid, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not going to happen to you!\u201d", "23": "Jesus turned on Peter and said, \u201cGet away from me, you Satan!

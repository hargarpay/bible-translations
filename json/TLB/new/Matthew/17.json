", "4": "Peter blurted out, \u201cSir, it's wonderful that we can be here! If you want me to, I'll make three shelters,[a] one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\u201d", "5": "But even as he said it, a bright cloud came over them, and a voice from the cloud said, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, and I am wonderfully pleased with him. Obey him.\u201d[b]", "6": "At this the disciples fell face downward to the ground, terribly frightened.

Elijah must come and set everything in order. ", "12": "And, in fact, he has already come, but he wasn't recognized, and was badly mistreated by many. And I, the Messiah,[d] shall also suffer at their hands.\u201d", "13": "Then the disciples realized he was speaking of John the Baptist.", "14": "When they arrived at the bottom of the hill, a huge crowd was waiting for them. A man came and knelt before Jesus and said, ", "15": "\u201cSir, have mercy on my son, for he is mentally deranged and in great trouble, for he often falls into the fire or into the water; ", "16": "so I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't cure him.\u201d", "17": "Jesus replied, \u201cOh, you stubborn, faithless people! How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.\u201d ", "18": "Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy and it left him, and from that moment the boy was well.", "19": "Afterwards the disciples asked Jesus privately, \u201cWhy couldn't we cast that demon out?\u201d", "20": "\u201cBecause of your little faith,\u201d Jesus told them. \u201cFor if you had faith even as small as a tiny mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, 'Move!' and it would go far away.

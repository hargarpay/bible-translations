{"1": "Peter and John went to the Temple one afternoon to take part in the three o'clock daily prayer meeting. ", "2": "As they approached the Temple, they saw a man lame from birth carried along the street and laid beside the Temple gate\u2014the one called The Beautiful Gate\u2014as was his custom every day. ", "3": "As Peter and John were passing by, he asked them for some money.", "4": "They looked at him intently, and then Peter said, \u201cLook here!\u201d", "5": "The lame man looked at them eagerly, expecting a gift.", "6": "But Peter said, \u201cWe don't have any money for you! But I'll give you something else! I command you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!\u201d", "7-8": "Then Peter took the lame man by the hand and pulled him to his feet. And as he did, the man's feet and ankle bones were healed and strengthened so that he came up with a leap, stood there a moment and began walking! Then, walking, leaping, and praising God, he went into the Temple with them.", "9": "When the people inside saw him walking and heard him praising God, ", "10": "and realized he was the lame beggar they had seen so often at The Beautiful Gate, they were inexpressibly surprised! ", "11": "They all rushed out to Solomon's Hall, where he was holding tightly to Peter and John! Everyone stood there awed by the wonderful thing that had happened.", "12": "Peter saw his opportunity and addressed the crowd. \u201cMen of Israel,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat is so surprising about this? And why look at us as though we by our own power and godliness had made this man walk? ", "13": "For it is the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and of all our ancestors who has brought glory to his servant Jesus by doing this. I refer to the Jesus whom you rejected before Pilate, despite Pilate's determination to release him. ", "14": "You didn't want him freed\u2014this holy, righteous one. Instead you demanded the release of a murderer. ", "15": "And you killed the Author of Life; but God brought him back to life again. And John and I are witnesses of this fact, for after you killed him we saw him alive!", "16": "\u201cJesus' name has healed this man\u2014and you know how lame he was before. Faith in Jesus' name\u2014faith given us from God\u2014has caused this perfect healing.", "17": "\u201cDear brothers, I realize that what you did to Jesus was done in ignorance; and the same can be said of your leaders.

", "21-22": "For he must remain in heaven until the final recovery of all things from sin, as prophesied from ancient times. Moses, for instance, said long ago, 'The Lord God will raise up a Prophet among you, who will resemble me![a] Listen carefully to everything he tells you.

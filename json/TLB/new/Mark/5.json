For God's sake, don't torture me!\u201d", "9": "\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Jesus asked, and the demon replied, \u201cLegion, for there are many of us here within this man.\u201d", "10": "Then the demons begged him again and again not to send them to some distant land.", "11": "Now as it happened there was a huge herd of hogs rooting around on the hill above the lake.

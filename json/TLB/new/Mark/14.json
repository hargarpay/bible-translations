Then, breaking the seal, she poured it over his head.", "4-5": "Some of those at the table were indignant among themselves about this \u201cwaste,\u201d as they called it. \u201cWhy, she could have sold that perfume for a fortune and given the money to the poor!\u201d they snarled.", "6": "But Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone; why berate her for doing a good thing? ", "7": "You always have the poor among you, and they badly need your help, and you can aid them whenever you want to; but I won't be here much longer.", "8": "\u201cShe has done what she could and has anointed my body ahead of time for burial.

So he began looking for the right time and place to betray Jesus.", "12": "On the first day of the Passover, the day the lambs were sacrificed, his disciples asked him where he wanted to go to eat the traditional Passover supper.

", "15": "He will take you upstairs to a large room all set up. Prepare our supper there.\u201d", "16": "So the two disciples went on ahead into the city and found everything as Jesus had said, and prepared the Passover.", "17": "In the evening Jesus arrived with the other disciples, ", "18": "and as they were sitting around the table eating, Jesus said, \u201cI solemnly declare that one of you will betray me, one of you who is here eating with me.\u201d", "19": "A great sadness swept over them, and one by one they asked him, \u201cAm I the one?\u201d", "20": "He replied, \u201cIt is one of you twelve eating with me now.

I'll never deny you!\u201d And all the others vowed the same.", "32": "And now they came to an olive grove called the Garden of Gethsemane, and he instructed his disciples, \u201cSit here, while I go and pray.\u201d", "33": "He took Peter, James, and John with him and began to be filled with horror and deepest distress. ", "34": "And he said to them, \u201cMy soul is crushed by sorrow to the point of death; stay here and watch with me.\u201d", "35": "He went on a little farther and fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the awful hour awaiting him might never come.[d]", "36": "\u201cFather, Father,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything is possible for you.

And they didn't know what to say.", "41": "The third time when he returned to them he said, \u201cSleep on; get your rest! But no! The time for sleep has ended! Look! I am[e] betrayed into the hands of wicked men. ", "42": "Come! Get up! We must go! Look! My betrayer is here!\u201d", "43": "And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas (one of his disciples) arrived with a mob equipped with swords and clubs, sent out by the chief priests and other Jewish leaders.", "44": "Judas had told them, \u201cYou will know which one to arrest when I go over and greet[f] him.

", "54": "Peter followed far behind and then slipped inside the gates of the high priest's residence and crouched beside a fire among the servants.", "55": "Inside, the chief priests and the whole Jewish Supreme Court were trying to find something against Jesus that would be sufficient to condemn him to death. But their efforts were in vain. ", "56": "Many false witnesses volunteered, but they contradicted each other.", "57": "Finally some men stood up to lie about him and said, ", "58": "\u201cWe heard him say, 'I will destroy this Temple made with human hands and in three days I will build another, made without human hands!'\u201d ", "59": "But even then they didn't get their stories straight!", "60": "Then the high priest stood up before the Court and asked Jesus, \u201cDo you refuse to answer this charge? What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d", "61": "To this Jesus made no reply. Then the high priest asked him. \u201cAre you the Messiah, the Son of God?\u201d", "62": "Jesus said, \u201cI am, and you will see me[i] sitting at the right hand of God, and returning to earth in the clouds of heaven.\u201d", "63-64": "Then the high priest tore at his clothes and said, \u201cWhat more do we need? Why wait for witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?\u201d And the vote for the death sentence was unanimous.", "65": "Then some of them began to spit at him, and they blindfolded him and began to hammer his face with their fists. \u201cWho hit you that time, you prophet?\u201d they jeered. And even the bailiffs were using their fists on him as they led him away.", "66-67": "Meanwhile Peter was below in the courtyard. One of the maids who worked for the high priest noticed Peter warming himself at the fire. She looked at him closely and then announced, \u201cYou were with Jesus, the Nazarene.\u201d", "68": "Peter denied it. \u201cI don't know what you're talking about!\u201d he said, and walked over to the edge of the courtyard. Just then, a rooster crowed.[j]", "69": "The maid saw him standing there and began telling the others, \u201cThere he is! There's that disciple of Jesus!\u201d", "70": "Peter denied it again. A little later others standing around the fire began saying to Peter, \u201cYou are, too, one of them, for you are from Galilee!\u201d", "71": "He began to curse and swear. \u201cI don't even know this fellow you are talking about,\u201d he said.", "72": "And immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Suddenly Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: \u201cBefore the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.\u201d And he began to cry."}

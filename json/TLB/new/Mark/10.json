{"1": "Then he left Capernaum[a] and went southward to the Judean borders and into the area east of the Jordan River. And as always there were the crowds; and as usual he taught them.", "2": "Some Pharisees came and asked him, \u201cDo you permit divorce?\u201d Of course they were trying to trap him.", "3": "\u201cWhat did Moses say about divorce?\u201d Jesus asked them.", "4": "\u201cHe said it was all right,\u201d they replied. \u201cHe said that all a man has to do is write his wife a letter of dismissal.\u201d", "5": "\u201cAnd why did he say that?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cI'll tell you why\u2014it was a concession to your hardhearted wickedness. ", "6-7": "But it certainly isn't God's way. For from the very first he made man and woman to be joined together permanently in marriage; therefore a man is to leave his father and mother, ", "8": "and he and his wife are united so that they are no longer two, but one. ", "9": "And no man may separate what God has joined together.\u201d", "10": "Later, when he was alone with his disciples in the house, they brought up the subject again.", "11": "He told them, \u201cWhen a man divorces his wife to marry someone else, he commits adultery against her. ", "12": "And if a wife divorces her husband and remarries, she, too, commits adultery.\u201d", "13": "Once when some mothers[b] were bringing their children to Jesus to bless them, the disciples shooed them away, telling them not to bother him.", "14": "But when Jesus saw what was happening he was very much displeased with his disciples and said to them, \u201cLet the children come to me, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as they. Don't send them away! ", "15": "I tell you as seriously as I know how that anyone who refuses to come to God as a little child will never be allowed into his Kingdom.\u201d", "16": "Then he took the children into his arms and placed his hands on their heads and he blessed them.", "17": "As he was starting out on a trip, a man came running to him and knelt down and asked, \u201cGood Teacher, what must I do to get to heaven?\u201d", "18": "\u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cOnly God is truly good! ", "19": "But as for your question\u2014you know the commandments: don't kill, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't lie, don't cheat, respect your father and mother.\u201d", "20": "\u201cTeacher,\u201d the man replied, \u201cI've never once[c] broken a single one of those laws.\u201d", "21": "Jesus felt genuine love for this man as he looked at him. \u201cYou lack only one thing,\u201d he told him; \u201cgo and sell all you have and give the money to the poor\u2014and you shall have treasure in heaven\u2014and come, follow me.\u201d", "22": "Then the man's face fell, and he went sadly away, for he was very rich.", "23": "Jesus watched him go, then turned around and said to his disciples, \u201cIt's almost impossible for the rich to get into the Kingdom of God!\u201d", "24": "This amazed them. So Jesus said it again: \u201cDear children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches[d] to enter the Kingdom of God. ", "25": "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.\u201d", "26": "The disciples were incredulous! \u201cThen who in the world can be saved, if not a rich man?\u201d they asked.", "27": "Jesus looked at them intently, then said, \u201cWithout God, it is utterly impossible. But with God everything is possible.\u201d", "28": "Then Peter began to mention all that he and the other disciples had left behind. \u201cWe've given up everything to follow you,\u201d he said.", "29": "And Jesus replied, \u201cLet me assure you that no one has ever given up anything\u2014home, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or property\u2014for love of me and to tell others the Good News, ", "30": "who won't be given back, a hundred times over, homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land\u2014with persecutions! \u201cAll these will be his here on earth, and in the world to come he shall have eternal life.

Taking them aside, Jesus once more began describing all that was going to happen to him when they arrived at Jerusalem.", "33": "\u201cWhen we get there,\u201d he told them, \u201cI, the Messiah,[e] will be arrested and taken before the chief priests and the Jewish leaders, who will sentence me to die and hand me over to the Romans to be killed. ", "34": "They will mock me and spit on me and flog me with their whips and kill me; but after three days I will come back to life again.\u201d", "35": "Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came over and spoke to him in a low voice.[f] \u201cMaster,\u201d they said, \u201cwe want you to do us a favor.\u201d", "36": "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.", "37": "\u201cWe want to sit on the thrones next to yours in your Kingdom,\u201d they said, \u201cone at your right and the other at your left!\u201d", "38": "But Jesus answered, \u201cYou don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of sorrow I must drink from? Or to be baptized with the baptism of suffering I must be baptized with?\u201d", "39": "\u201cOh, yes,\u201d they said, \u201cwe are!\u201d And Jesus said, \u201cYou shall indeed drink from my cup and be baptized with my baptism, ", "40": "but I do not have the right to place you on thrones next to mine. Those appointments have already been made.\u201d", "41": "When the other disciples discovered what James and John had asked, they were very indignant. ", "42": "So Jesus called them to him and said, \u201cAs you know, the kings and great men of the earth lord it over the people; ", "43": "but among you it is different. Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant. ", "44": "And whoever wants to be greatest of all must be the slave of all. ", "45": "For even I, the Messiah,[g] am not here to be served, but to help others, and to give my life as a ransom for many.\u201d", "46": "And so they reached Jericho. Later, as they left town, a great crowd was following. Now it happened that a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting beside the road as Jesus was going by.", "47": "When Bartimaeus heard that Jesus from Nazareth was near, he began to shout out, \u201cJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\u201d", "48": "\u201cShut up!\u201d some of the people yelled at him. But he only shouted the louder, again and again, \u201cO\u00a0Son of David, have mercy on me!\u201d", "49": "When Jesus heard him, he stopped there in the road and said, \u201cTell him to come here.\u201d So they called the blind man. \u201cYou lucky fellow,\u201d[h] they said, \u201ccome on, he's calling you!\u201d ", "50": "Bartimaeus yanked off his old coat and flung it aside, jumped up and came to Jesus.", "51": "\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cO\u00a0Teacher,\u201d the blind man said, \u201cI want to see!\u201d", "52": "And Jesus said to him, \u201cAll right, it's done.[i] Your faith has healed you.\u201d And instantly the blind man could see and followed Jesus down the road!"}

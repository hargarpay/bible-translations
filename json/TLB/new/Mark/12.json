{"1": "Here are some of the story-illustrations Jesus gave to the people at that time: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and built a wall around it and dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a watchman's tower. Then he leased the farm to tenant farmers and moved to another country. ", "2": "At grape-picking time he sent one of his men to collect his share of the crop. ", "3": "But the farmers beat up the man and sent him back empty-handed.", "4": "\u201cThe owner then sent another of his men, who received the same treatment, only worse, for his head was seriously injured. ", "5": "The next man he sent was killed; and later, others were either beaten or killed, until ", "6": "there was only one left\u2014his only son. He finally sent him, thinking they would surely give him their full respect.", "7": "\u201cBut when the farmers saw him coming they said, 'He will own the farm when his father dies. Come on, let's kill him\u2014and then the farm will be ours!' ", "8": "So they caught him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard.", "9": "\u201cWhat do you suppose the owner will do when he hears what happened? He will come and kill them all, and lease the vineyard to others. ", "10": "Don't you remember reading this verse in the Scriptures? 'The Rock the builders threw away became the cornerstone, the most honored stone in the building!

But they were afraid to touch him for fear of a mob. So they left him and went away.", "13": "But they sent other religious and political leaders to talk with him and try to trap him into saying something he could be arrested for.", "14": "\u201cTeacher,\u201d these spies said, \u201cwe know you tell the truth no matter what! You aren't influenced by the opinions and desires of men, but sincerely teach the ways of God. Now tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Rome, or not?\u201d", "15": "Jesus saw their trick and said, \u201cShow me a coin and I'll tell you.\u201d", "16": "When they handed it to him he asked, \u201cWhose picture and title is this on the coin?\u201d They replied, \u201cThe emperor's.\u201d", "17": "\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, \u201cif it is his, give it to him.

Then the next brother married her and died without children, and so on until all were dead, and still there were no children; and last of all, the woman died too.", "23": "\u201cWhat we want to know is this:[a] In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, for she had been the wife of each of them?\u201d", "24": "Jesus replied, \u201cYour trouble is that you don't know the Scriptures and don't know the power of God.

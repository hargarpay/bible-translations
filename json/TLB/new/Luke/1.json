{"1-2": "Dear friend who loves God:[a] Several biographies of Christ have already been written using as their source material the reports circulating among us from the early disciples and other eyewitnesses. ", "3": "However, it occurred to me that it would be well to recheck all these accounts from first to last and after thorough investigation to pass this summary on to you,[b] ", "4": "to reassure you of the truth of all you were taught.", "5": "My story begins with a Jewish priest, Zacharias, who lived when Herod was king of Judea. Zacharias was a member of the Abijah division of the Temple service corps. (His wife, Elizabeth, was, like himself, a member of the priest tribe of the Jews, a descendant of Aaron.) ", "6": "Zacharias and Elizabeth were godly folk, careful to obey all of God's laws in spirit as well as in letter. ", "7": "But they had no children, for Elizabeth was barren; and now they were both very old.", "8-9": "One day as Zacharias was going about his work in the Temple\u2014for his division was on duty that week\u2014the honor fell to him by lot[c] to enter the inner sanctuary and burn incense before the Lord. ", "10": "Meanwhile, a great crowd stood outside in the Temple court, praying as they always did during that part of the service when the incense was being burned.", "11-12": "Zacharias was in the sanctuary when suddenly an angel appeared, standing to the right of the altar of incense! Zacharias was startled and terrified.", "13": "But the angel said, \u201cDon't be afraid, Zacharias! For I have come to tell you that God has heard your prayer, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son! And you are to name him John. ", "14": "You will both have great joy and gladness at his birth, and many will rejoice with you. ", "15": "For he will be one of the Lord's great men. He must never touch wine or hard liquor\u2014and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from before his birth! ", "16": "And he will persuade many a Jew to turn to the Lord his God. ", "17": "He will be a man of rugged[d] spirit and power like Elijah, the prophet of old; and he will precede the coming of the Messiah, preparing the people for his arrival. He will soften adult hearts to become like little children's, and will change disobedient minds to the wisdom of faith.\u201d*", "18": "Zacharias said to the angel, \u201cBut this is impossible! I'm an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years.\u201d", "19": "Then the angel said, \u201cI am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to you with this good news! ", "20": "And now, because you haven't believed me, you are to be stricken silent, unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly come true at the proper time.\u201d", "21": "Meanwhile the crowds outside were waiting for Zacharias to appear and wondered why he was taking so long. ", "22": "When he finally came out, he couldn't speak to them, and they realized from his gestures that he must have seen a vision in the Temple. ", "23": "He stayed on at the Temple for the remaining days of his Temple duties and then returned home. ", "24": "Soon afterwards Elizabeth his wife became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.", "25": "\u201cHow kind the Lord is,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cto take away my disgrace of having no children!\u201d", "26": "The following month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, ", "27": "to a virgin, Mary, engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.", "28": "Gabriel appeared to her and said, \u201cCongratulations, favored lady! The Lord is with you!\u201d[e]", "29": "Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.", "30": "\u201cDon't be frightened, Mary,\u201d the angel told her, \u201cfor God has decided to wonderfully bless you! ", "31": "Very soon now, you will become pregnant and have a baby boy, and you are to name him 'Jesus.' ", "32": "He shall be very great and shall be called the Son of God.

I am a virgin.\u201d", "35": "The angel replied, \u201cThe Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of God shall overshadow you; so the baby born to you will be utterly holy\u2014the Son of God. ", "36": "Furthermore, six months ago your Aunt[f] Elizabeth\u2014'the barren one,' they called her\u2014became pregnant in her old age!

", "45": "You believed that God would do what he said; that is why he has given you this wonderful blessing.\u201d", "46": "Mary responded, \u201cOh, how I praise the Lord. ", "47": "How I rejoice in God my Savior! ", "48": "For he took notice of his lowly servant girl, and now generation after generation forever shall call me blest of God. ", "49": "For he, the mighty Holy One, has done great things to me. ", "50": "His mercy goes on from generation to generation, to all who reverence him.", "51": "\u201cHow powerful is his mighty arm! How he scatters the proud and haughty ones! ", "52": "He has torn princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly. ", "53": "He has satisfied the hungry hearts and sent the rich away with empty hands. ", "54": "And how he has helped his servant Israel! He has not forgotten his promise to be merciful. ", "55": "For he promised our fathers\u2014Abraham and his children\u2014to be merciful to them forever.\u201d", "56": "Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.", "57": "By now Elizabeth's waiting was over, for the time had come for the baby to be born\u2014and it was a boy.

They all assumed the baby's name would be Zacharias, after his father.", "60": "But Elizabeth said, \u201cNo! He must be named John!\u201d", "61": "\u201cWhat?\u201d they exclaimed. \u201cThere is no one in all your family by that name.\u201d ", "62": "So they asked the baby's father, talking to him by gestures.[g]", "63": "He motioned for a piece of paper and to everyone's surprise wrote, \u201cHis name is John!\u201d ", "64": "Instantly Zacharias could speak again, and he began praising God.", "65": "Wonder fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread through the Judean hills. ", "66": "And everyone who heard about it thought long thoughts and asked, \u201cI wonder what this child will turn out to be? For the hand of the Lord is surely upon him in some special way.\u201d", "67": "Then his father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:", "68": "\u201cPraise the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has come to visit his people and has redeemed them.

", "11": "But the crowds found out where he was going and followed. And he welcomed them, teaching them again about the Kingdom of God and curing those who were ill.", "12": "Late in the afternoon all twelve of the disciples came and urged him to send the people away to the nearby villages and farms, to find food and lodging for the night. \u201cFor there is nothing to eat here in this deserted spot,\u201d they said.", "13": "But Jesus replied, \u201cYou feed them!\u201d \u201cWhy, we have only five loaves of bread and two fish among the lot of us,\u201d they protested; \u201cor are you expecting us to go and buy enough for this whole mob?\u201d ", "14": "For there were about 5,000 men there! \u201cJust tell them to sit down on the ground in groups of about fifty each,\u201d Jesus replied.

Now they woke up and saw Jesus covered with brightness and glory, and the two men standing with him.

But Jesus ordered the demon to come out, and healed the boy and handed him over to his father.", "43": "Awe gripped the people as they saw this display of the power of God. Meanwhile, as they were exclaiming over all the wonderful things he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, ", "44": "\u201cListen to me and remember what I say.

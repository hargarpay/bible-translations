So it is written in the Scriptures.\u201d", "9-11": "Then Satan took him to Jerusalem to a high roof of the Temple and said, \u201cIf you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say that God will send his angels to guard you and to keep you from crashing to the pavement below!\u201d", "12": "Jesus replied, \u201cThe Scriptures also say, 'Do not put the Lord your God to a foolish test.'\u201d", "13": "When the devil had ended all the temptations, he left Jesus for a while and went away.", "14": "Then Jesus returned to Galilee, full of the Holy Spirit's power.

We want nothing to do with you, Jesus from Nazareth. You have come to destroy us.

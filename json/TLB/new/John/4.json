Jesus was tired from the long walk in the hot sun and sat wearily beside the well.", "7": "Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus asked her for a drink. ", "8": "He was alone at the time as his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food. ", "9": "The woman was surprised that a Jew would ask a \u201cdespised Samaritan\u201d for anything\u2014usually they wouldn't even speak to them!\u2014and she remarked about this to Jesus.", "10": "He replied, \u201cIf you only knew what a wonderful gift God has for you, and who I am, you would ask me for some living water!\u201d", "11": "\u201cBut you don't have a rope or a bucket,\u201d she said, \u201cand this is a very deep well! Where would you get this living water? ", "12": "And besides, are you greater than our ancestor Jacob? How can you offer better water than this which he and his sons and cattle enjoyed?\u201d", "13": "Jesus replied that people soon became thirsty again after drinking this water. ", "14": "\u201cBut the water I give them,\u201d he said, \u201cbecomes a perpetual spring within them, watering them forever with eternal life.\u201d", "15": "\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d the woman said, \u201cgive me some of that water!

For it's not where we worship that counts, but how we worship\u2014is our worship spiritual and real? Do we have the Holy Spirit's help? For God is Spirit, and we must have his help to worship as we should. The Father wants this kind of worship from us. But you Samaritans know so little about him, worshiping blindly, while we Jews know all about him, for salvation comes to the world through the Jews.\u201d", "25": "The woman said, \u201cWell, at least I know that the Messiah will come\u2014the one they call Christ\u2014and when he does, he will explain everything to us.\u201d", "26": "Then Jesus told her, \u201cI am the Messiah!\u201d", "27": "Just then his disciples arrived.

Vast fields of human souls are ripening all around us, and are ready now for reaping. ", "36": "The reapers will be paid good wages and will be gathering eternal souls into the granaries of heaven! What joys await the sower and the reaper, both together! ", "37": "For it is true that one sows and someone else reaps.

While he was there, a man in the city of Capernaum, a government official, whose son was very sick, heard that Jesus had come from Judea and was traveling in Galilee. This man went over to Cana, found Jesus, and begged him to come to Capernaum with him and heal his son, who was now at death's door.", "48": "Jesus asked, \u201cWon't any of you believe in me unless I do more and more miracles?\u201d", "49": "The official pled, \u201cSir, please come now before my child dies.\u201d", "50": "Then Jesus told him, \u201cGo back home. Your son is healed!\u201d And the man believed Jesus and started home. ", "51": "While he was on his way, some of his servants met him with the news that all was well\u2014his son had recovered. ", "52": "He asked them when the lad had begun to feel better, and they replied, \u201cYesterday afternoon at about one o'clock his fever suddenly disappeared!\u201d ", "53": "Then the father realized it was the same moment that Jesus had told him, \u201cYour son is healed.\u201d And the officer and his entire household believed that Jesus was the Messiah.", "54": "This was Jesus' second miracle in Galilee after coming from Judea."}

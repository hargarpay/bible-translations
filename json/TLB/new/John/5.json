", "3": "Crowds of sick folks\u2014lame, blind, or with paralyzed limbs\u2014lay on the platforms (waiting for a certain movement of the water, ", "4": "for an angel of the Lord came from time to time and disturbed the water, and the first person to step down into it afterwards was healed).[a]", "5": "One of the men lying there had been sick for thirty-eight years. ", "6": "When Jesus saw him and knew how long he had been ill, he asked him, \u201cWould you like to get well?\u201d", "7": "\u201cI can't,\u201d the sick man said, \u201cfor I have no one to help me into the pool at the movement of the water. While I am trying to get there, someone else always gets in ahead of me.\u201d", "8": "Jesus told him, \u201cStand up, roll up your sleeping mat and go on home!\u201d", "9": "Instantly, the man was healed! He rolled up the mat and began walking! But it was on the Sabbath when this miracle was done. ", "10": "So the Jewish leaders objected. They said to the man who was cured, \u201cYou can't work on the Sabbath! It's illegal to carry that sleeping mat!\u201d", "11": "\u201cThe man who healed me told me to,\u201d was his reply.", "12": "\u201cWho said such a thing as that?\u201d they demanded.", "13": "The man didn't know, and Jesus had disappeared into the crowd.

He does only what he sees the Father doing, and in the same way.

", "3": "\u201cHail, 'King of the Jews'!\u201d they mocked, and struck him with their fists.", "4": "Pilate went outside again and said to the Jews, \u201cI am going to bring him out to you now, but understand clearly that I find him not guilty.\u201d", "5": "Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, \u201cBehold the man!\u201d", "6": "At sight of him the chief priests and Jewish officials began yelling, \u201cCrucify! Crucify!\u201d \u201cYou crucify him,\u201d Pilate said. \u201cI find him not guilty.\u201d", "7": "They replied, \u201cBy our laws he ought to die because he called himself the Son of God.\u201d", "8": "When Pilate heard this, he was more frightened than ever.

So those[a] who brought me to you have the greater sin.\u201d", "12": "Then Pilate tried to release him, but the Jewish leaders told him, \u201cIf you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar's. Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar.\u201d", "13": "At these words Pilate brought Jesus out to them again and sat down at the judgment bench on the stone-paved platform.[b] ", "14": "It was now about noon of the day before Passover.

Crucify your king?\u201d Pilate asked. \u201cWe have no king but Caesar,\u201d the chief priests shouted back.", "16": "Then Pilate gave Jesus to them to be crucified.", "17": "So they had him at last, and he was taken out of the city, carrying his cross to the place known as \u201cThe Skull,\u201d in Hebrew, \u201cGolgotha.\u201d ", "18": "There they crucified him and two others with him, one on either side, with Jesus between them. ", "19": "And Pilate posted a sign over him reading, \u201cJesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\u201d ", "20": "The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and the signboard was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, so that many people read it.", "21": "Then the chief priests said to Pilate, \u201cChange it from 'The King of the Jews' to 'He said, I am King of the Jews.'\u201d", "22": "Pilate replied, \u201cWhat I have written, I have written. It stays exactly as it is.\u201d", "23-24": "When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they put his garments into four piles, one for each of them.

", "41": "The place of crucifixion was near a grove of trees,[i] where there was a new tomb, never used before. ", "42": "And so, because of the need for haste before the Sabbath, and because the tomb was close at hand, they laid him there."}

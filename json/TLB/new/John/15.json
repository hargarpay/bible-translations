", "3": "He has already tended you by pruning you back for greater strength and usefulness by means of the commands I gave you. ", "4": "Take care to live in me, and let me live in you. For a branch can't produce fruit when severed from the vine. Nor can you be fruitful apart from me.", "5": "\u201cYes, I am the Vine; you are the branches. Whoever lives in me and I in him shall produce a large crop of fruit. For apart from me you can't do a thing.

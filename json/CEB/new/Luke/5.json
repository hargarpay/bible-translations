But because you say so, I'll drop the nets.\u201d", "6": "So they dropped the nets and their catch was so huge that their nets were splitting.", "7": "They signaled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They filled both boats so full that they were about to sink.", "8": "When Simon Peter saw the catch, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, \u201cLeave me, Lord, for I'm a sinner!\u201d", "9": "Peter and those with him were overcome with amazement because of the number of fish they caught.", "10": "James and John, Zebedee's sons, were Simon's partners and they were amazed too.

Only God can forgive sins!\u201d", "22": "Jesus recognized what they were discussing and responded, \u201cWhy do you fill your minds with these questions?", "23": "Which is easier\u2014to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?", "24": "But so that you will know that the Human One[a] has authority on the earth to forgive sins\u201d \u2014Jesus now spoke to the man who was paralyzed, \u201cI say to you, get up, take your cot, and go home.\u201d", "25": "Right away, the man stood before them, picked up his cot, and went home, praising God.", "26": "All the people were beside themselves with wonder. Filled with awe, they glorified God, saying, \u201cWe've seen unimaginable things today.\u201d", "27": "Afterward, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes. Jesus said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d", "28": "Levi got up, left everything behind, and followed him.", "29": "Then Levi threw a great banquet for Jesus in his home. A large number of tax collectors and others sat down to eat with them.", "30": "The Pharisees and their legal experts grumbled against his disciples. They said, \u201cWhy do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\u201d", "31": "Jesus answered, \u201cHealthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do.", "32": "I didn't come to call righteous people but sinners to change their hearts and lives.\u201d", "33": "Some people said to Jesus, \u201cThe disciples of John fast often and pray frequently. The disciples of the Pharisees do the same, but your disciples are always eating and drinking.\u201d", "34": "Jesus replied, \u201cYou can't make the wedding guests fast while the groom is with them, can you?", "35": "The days will come when the groom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.\u201d", "36": "Then he told them a parable. \u201cNo one tears a patch from a new garment to patch an old garment. Otherwise, the new garment would be ruined, and the new patch wouldn't match the old garment.", "37": "Nobody pours new wine into old wineskins.

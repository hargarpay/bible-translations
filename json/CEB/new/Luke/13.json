Do you think that they were more guilty of wrongdoing than everyone else who lives in Jerusalem?", "5": "No, I tell you, but unless you change your hearts and lives, you will die just as they did.\u201d", "6": "Jesus told this parable: \u201cA man owned a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it and found none.", "7": "He said to his gardener, 'Look, I've come looking for fruit on this fig tree for the past three years, and I've never found any. Cut it down!

It grew and developed into a tree and the birds in the sky nested in its branches.\u201d", "20": "Again he said, \u201cTo what can I compare God's kingdom?", "21": "It's like yeast, which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through the whole.\u201d", "22": "Jesus traveled through cities and villages, teaching and making his way to Jerusalem.", "23": "Someone said to him, \u201cLord, will only a few be saved?\u201d Jesus said to them,", "24": "\u201cMake every effort to enter through the narrow gate.

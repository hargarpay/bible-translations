{"1": "Later, Jesus himself appeared again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. This is how it happened:", "2": "Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus[a]), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two other disciples were together.", "3": "Simon Peter told them, \u201cI'm going fishing.\u201d They said, \u201cWe'll go with you.\u201d They set out in a boat, but throughout the night they caught nothing.", "4": "Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.", "5": "Jesus called to them, \u201cChildren, have you caught anything to eat?\u201d They answered him, \u201cNo.\u201d", "6": "He said, \u201cCast your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\u201d So they did, and there were so many fish that they couldn't haul in the net.", "7": "Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt's the Lord!\u201d When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around himself (for he was naked) and jumped into the water.", "8": "The other disciples followed in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they weren't far from shore, only about one hundred yards.", "9": "When they landed, they saw a fire there, with fish on it, and some bread.", "10": "Jesus said to them, \u201cBring some of the fish that you've just caught.\u201d", "11": "Simon Peter got up and pulled the net to shore. It was full of large fish, one hundred fifty-three of them. Yet the net hadn't torn, even with so many fish.", "12": "Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d None of the disciples could bring themselves to ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord.", "13": "Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish.", "14": "This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.", "15": "When they finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me more than these?\u201d Simon replied, \u201cYes, Lord, you know I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d", "16": "Jesus asked a second time, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Simon replied, \u201cYes, Lord, you know I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTake care of my sheep.\u201d", "17": "He asked a third time, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter was sad that Jesus asked him a third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d He replied, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep.", "18": "I assure you that when you were younger you tied your own belt and walked around wherever you wanted. When you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and another will tie your belt and lead you where you don't want to go.\u201d", "19": "He said this to show the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. After saying this, Jesus said to Peter, \u201cFollow me.\u201d", "20": "Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them.

You must follow me.\u201d", "23": "Therefore, the word spread among the brothers and sisters that this disciple wouldn't die. However, Jesus didn't say he wouldn't die, but only, \u201cIf I want him to remain until I come, what difference does that make to you?\u201d", "24": "This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.", "25": "Jesus did many other things as well. If all of them were recorded, I imagine the world itself wouldn't have enough room for the scrolls that would be written."}

{"1": "As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who was blind from birth.", "2": "Jesus' disciples asked, \u201cRabbi, who sinned so that he was born blind, this man or his parents?\u201d", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cNeither he nor his parents. This happened so that God's mighty works might be displayed in him.", "4": "While it's daytime, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming when no one can work.", "5": "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u201d", "6": "After he said this, he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and smeared the mud on the man's eyes.", "7": "Jesus said to him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (this word means sent). So the man went away and washed. When he returned, he could see.", "8": "The man's neighbors and those who used to see him when he was a beggar said, \u201cIsn't this the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d", "9": "Some said, \u201cIt is,\u201d and others said, \u201cNo, it's someone who looks like him.\u201d But the man said, \u201cYes, it's me!\u201d", "10": "So they asked him, \u201cHow are you now able to see?\u201d", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe man they call Jesus made mud, smeared it on my eyes, and said, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed, and then I could see.\u201d", "12": "They asked, \u201cWhere is this man?\u201d He replied, \u201cI don't know.\u201d", "13": "Then they led the man who had been born blind to the Pharisees.", "14": "Now Jesus made the mud and smeared it on the man's eyes on a Sabbath day.", "15": "So Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see. The man told them, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see.\u201d", "16": "Some Pharisees said, \u201cThis man isn't from God, because he breaks the Sabbath law.\u201d Others said, \u201cHow can a sinner do miraculous signs like these?\u201d So they were divided.", "17": "Some of the Pharisees questioned the man who had been born blind again: \u201cWhat do you have to say about him, since he healed your eyes?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe's a prophet.\u201d", "18": "The Jewish leaders didn't believe the man had been blind and received his sight until they called for his parents.", "19": "The Jewish leaders asked them, \u201cIs this your son? Are you saying he was born blind? How can he now see?\u201d", "20": "His parents answered, \u201cWe know he is our son. We know he was born blind.", "21": "But we don't know how he now sees, and we don't know who healed his eyes. Ask him. He's old enough to speak for himself.\u201d", "22": "His parents said this because they feared the Jewish authorities. This is because the Jewish authorities had already decided that whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be expelled from the synagogue.", "23": "That's why his parents said, \u201cHe's old enough. Ask him.\u201d", "24": "Therefore, they called a second time for the man who had been born blind and said to him, \u201cGive glory to God. We know this man is a sinner.\u201d", "25": "The man answered, \u201cI don't know whether he's a sinner. Here's what I do know: I was blind and now I see.\u201d", "26": "They questioned him: \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he heal your eyes?\u201d", "27": "He replied, \u201cI already told you, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u201d", "28": "They insulted him: \u201cYou are his disciple, but we are Moses' disciples.", "29": "We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don't know where this man is from.\u201d", "30": "The man answered, \u201cThis is incredible! You don't know where he is from, yet he healed my eyes!", "31": "We know that God doesn't listen to sinners. God listens to anyone who is devout and does God's will.", "32": "No one has ever heard of a healing of the eyes of someone born blind.", "33": "If this man wasn't from God, he couldn't do this.\u201d", "34": "They responded, \u201cYou were born completely in sin! How is it that you dare to teach us?\u201d Then they expelled him.", "35": "Jesus heard they had expelled the man born blind. Finding him, Jesus said, \u201cDo you believe in the Human One?\u201d[a]", "36": "He answered, \u201cWho is he, sir?[b] I want to believe in him.\u201d", "37": "Jesus said, \u201cYou have seen him. In fact, he is the one speaking with you.\u201d", "38": "The man said, \u201cLord,[c] I believe.\u201d And he worshipped Jesus.", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cI have come into the world to exercise judgment so that those who don't see can see and those who see will become blind.\u201d", "40": "Some Pharisees who were with him heard what he said and asked, \u201cSurely we aren't blind, are we?\u201d", "41": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf you were blind, you wouldn't have any sin, but now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."}

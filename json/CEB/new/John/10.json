{"1": "I assure you that whoever doesn't enter into the sheep pen through the gate but climbs over the wall is a thief and an outlaw.", "2": "The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.", "3": "The guard at the gate opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.", "4": "Whenever he has gathered all of his sheep, he goes before them and they follow him, because they know his voice.", "5": "They won't follow a stranger but will run away because they don't know the stranger's voice.\u201d", "6": "Those who heard Jesus use this analogy didn't understand what he was saying.", "7": "So Jesus spoke again, \u201cI assure you that I am the gate of the sheep.", "8": "All who came before me were thieves and outlaws, but the sheep didn't listen to them.", "9": "I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out and find pasture.", "10": "The thief enters only to steal, kill, and destroy. I came so that they could have life\u2014indeed, so that they could live life to the fullest.", "11": "\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.", "12": "When the hired hand sees the wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away. That's because he isn't the shepherd; the sheep aren't really his. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.", "13": "He's only a hired hand and the sheep don't matter to him.", "14": "\u201cI am the good shepherd. I know my own sheep and they know me,", "15": "just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. I give up my life for the sheep.", "16": "I have other sheep that don't belong to this sheep pen. I must lead them too. They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock, with one shepherd.", "17": "\u201cThis is why the Father loves me: I give up my life so that I can take it up again.", "18": "No one takes it from me, but I give it up because I want to. I have the right to give it up, and I have the right to take it up again. I received this commandment from my Father.\u201d", "19": "There was another division among the Jews because of Jesus' words.", "20": "Many of them said, \u201cHe has a demon and has lost his mind. Why listen to him?\u201d", "21": "Others said, \u201cThese aren't the words of someone who has a demon. Can a demon heal the eyes of people who are blind?\u201d", "22": "The time came for the Festival of Dedication[a] in Jerusalem. It was winter,", "23": "and Jesus was in the temple, walking in the covered porch named for Solomon.", "24": "The Jewish opposition circled around him and asked, \u201cHow long will you test our patience? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\u201d", "25": "Jesus answered, \u201cI have told you, but you don't believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify about me,", "26": "but you don't believe because you don't belong to my sheep.", "27": "My sheep listen to my voice. I know them and they follow me.", "28": "I give them eternal life. They will never die, and no one will snatch them from my hand.", "29": "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them from my Father's hand.", "30": "I and the Father are one.\u201d", "31": "Again the Jewish opposition picked up stones in order to stone him.", "32": "Jesus responded, \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works do you stone me?\u201d", "33": "The Jewish opposition answered, \u201cWe don't stone you for a good work but for insulting God. You are human, yet you make yourself out to be God.\u201d", "34": "Jesus replied, \u201cIsn't it written in your Law, I have said, you are gods?[b]", "35": "Scripture calls those to whom God's word came gods, and scripture can't be abolished.", "36": "So how can you say that the one whom the Father has made holy and sent into the world insults God because he said, 'I am God's Son'?", "37": "If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.", "38": "But if I do them, and you don't believe me, believe the works so that you can know and recognize that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d", "39": "Again, they wanted to arrest him, but he escaped from them.", "40": "Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had baptized at first, and he stayed there.", "41": "Many people came to him. \u201cJohn didn't do any miraculous signs,\u201d they said, \u201cbut everything John said about this man was true.\u201d", "42": "Many believed in Jesus there."}

Whoever walks in the day doesn't stumble because they see the light of the world.", "10": "But whoever walks in the night does stumble because the light isn't in them.\u201d", "11": "He continued, \u201cOur friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going in order to wake him up.\u201d", "12": "The disciples said, \u201cLord, if he's sleeping, he will get well.\u201d", "13": "They thought Jesus meant that Lazarus was in a deep sleep, but Jesus had spoken about Lazarus' death.", "14": "Jesus told them plainly, \u201cLazarus has died.", "15": "For your sakes, I'm glad I wasn't there so that you can believe.

It was a cave, and a stone covered the entrance.", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cRemove the stone.\u201d Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, \u201cLord, the smell will be awful! He's been dead four days.\u201d", "40": "Jesus replied, \u201cDidn't I tell you that if you believe, you will see God's glory?\u201d", "41": "So they removed the stone. Jesus looked up and said, \u201cFather, thank you for hearing me.", "42": "I know you always hear me. I say this for the benefit of the crowd standing here so that they will believe that you sent me.\u201d", "43": "Having said this, Jesus shouted with a loud voice, \u201cLazarus, come out!\u201d", "44": "The dead man came out, his feet bound and his hands tied, and his face covered with a cloth.

Jesus would also die so that God's children scattered everywhere would be gathered together as one.", "53": "From that day on they plotted to kill him.", "54": "Therefore, Jesus was no longer active in public ministry among the Jewish leaders.

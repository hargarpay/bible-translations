The Lord punishes people for all these things, as we told you before and sternly warned you.", "7": "God didn't call us to be immoral but to be dedicated to him.[c]", "8": "Therefore, whoever rejects these instructions isn't rejecting a human authority. They are rejecting God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.", "9": "You don't need us to write about loving your brothers and sisters because God has already taught you to love each other.", "10": "In fact, you are doing loving deeds for all the brothers and sisters throughout Macedonia.

First, those who are dead in Christ will rise.", "17": "Then, we who are living and still around will be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet with the Lord in the air. That way we will always be with the Lord.", "18": "So encourage each other with these words."}

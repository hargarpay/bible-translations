We aren't trying to please people, but we are trying to please God, who continues to examine our hearts.", "5": "As you know, we never used flattery, and God is our witness that we didn't have greedy motives.", "6": "We didn't ask for special treatment from people\u2014not from you or from others\u2014", "7": "although we could have thrown our weight around as Christ's apostles.

Instead of accepting it as a human message, you accepted it as God's message, and it continues to work in you who are believers.", "14": "Brothers and sisters, you became imitators of the churches of God in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus. This was because you also suffered the same things from your own people as they did from the Jews.", "15": "They killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out. They don't please God, and they are hostile to the entire human race", "16": "when they try to stop us from speaking to the Gentiles so they can be saved. Their sins are constantly pushing the limit.[a] God's wrath has caught up with them in the end.", "17": "Brothers and sisters, we were separated from you for a while physically but not in our hearts. We made every effort in our desire to see you again face-to-face.", "18": "We wanted to come to you\u2014I, Paul, tried over and over again\u2014and Satan stopped us.", "19": "What is our hope, joy, or crown that we can brag about in front of our Lord Jesus when he comes?

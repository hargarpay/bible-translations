He was the son of a believing Jewish woman and a Greek father.", "2": "The brothers and sisters in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.", "3": "Paul wanted to take Timothy with him, so he circumcised him. This was because of the Jews who lived in those areas, for they all knew Timothy's father was Greek.", "4": "As Paul and his companions traveled through the cities, they instructed Gentile believers to keep the regulations put in place by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.", "5": "So the churches were strengthened in the faith and every day their numbers flourished.", "6": "Paul and his companions traveled throughout the regions of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit kept them from speaking the word in the province of Asia.", "7": "When they approached the province of Mysia, they tried to enter the province of Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus wouldn't let them.", "8": "Passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas instead.", "9": "A vision of a man from Macedonia came to Paul during the night.

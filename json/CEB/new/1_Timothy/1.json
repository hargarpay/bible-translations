Their teaching only causes useless guessing games instead of faithfulness to God's way of doing things.", "5": "The goal of instruction is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.", "6": "Because they missed this goal, some people have been distracted by talk that doesn't mean anything.", "7": "They want to be teachers of Law without understanding either what they are saying or what they are talking about with such confidence.", "8": "Now we know that the Law is good if used appropriately.", "9": "We understand this: the Law isn't established for a righteous person but for people who live without laws and without obeying any authority. They are the ungodly and the sinners. They are people who are not spiritual, and nothing is sacred to them. They kill their fathers and mothers, and murder others.", "10": "They are people who are sexually unfaithful, and people who have intercourse with the same sex.

Amen.", "18": "Timothy, my child, I'm giving you these instructions based on the prophecies that were once made about you. So if you follow them, you can wage a good war", "19": "because you have faith and a good conscience. Some people have ruined their faith because they refused to listen to their conscience,", "20": "such as Hymenaeus and Alexander. I've handed them over to Satan so that they can be taught not to speak against God."}

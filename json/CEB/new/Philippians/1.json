You are all my partners in God's grace, both during my time in prison and in the defense and support of the gospel.", "8": "God is my witness that I feel affection for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.", "9": "This is my prayer: that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and all kinds of insight.", "10": "I pray this so that you will be able to decide what really matters and so you will be sincere and blameless on the day of Christ.", "11": "I pray that you will then be filled with the fruit of righteousness, which comes from Jesus Christ, in order to give glory and praise to God.", "12": "Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that the things that have happened to me have actually advanced the gospel.", "13": "The whole Praetorian Guard and everyone else knows that I'm in prison for Christ.", "14": "Most of the brothers and sisters have had more confidence through the Lord to speak the word boldly and bravely because of my jail time.", "15": "Some certainly preach Christ with jealous and competitive motives, but others preach with good motives.", "16": "They are motivated by love, because they know that I'm put here to give a defense of the gospel;", "17": "the others preach Christ because of their selfish ambition. They are insincere, hoping to cause me more pain while I'm in prison.", "18": "What do I think about this?

Do this so that you stand firm, united in one spirit and mind as you struggle together to remain faithful to the gospel.", "28": "That way, you won't be afraid of anything your enemies do. Your faithfulness and courage are a sign of their coming destruction and your salvation, which is from God.", "29": "God has generously granted you the privilege, not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for Christ's sake.", "30": "You are having the same struggle that you saw me face and now hear that I'm still facing."}

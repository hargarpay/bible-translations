Instead, I must write to urge you to fight for the faith delivered once and for all to God's holy people.", "4": "Godless people have slipped in among you. They turn the grace of our God into unrestrained immorality and deny our only master and Lord, Jesus Christ. Judgment was passed against them a long time ago.", "5": "I want to remind you of something you already know very well. The Lord, who once saved a people out of Egypt, later destroyed those who didn't maintain their faith.", "6": "I remind you too of the angels who didn't keep their position of authority but deserted their own home.

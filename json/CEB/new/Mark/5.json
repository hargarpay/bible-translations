No one was tough enough to control him.", "5": "Night and day in the tombs and the hills, he would howl and cut himself with stones.", "6": "When he saw Jesus from far away, he ran and knelt before him,", "7": "shouting, \u201cWhat have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!\u201d", "8": "He said this because Jesus had already commanded him, \u201cUnclean spirit, come out of the man!\u201d", "9": "Jesus asked him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He responded, \u201cLegion is my name, because we are many.\u201d", "10": "They pleaded with Jesus not to send them out of that region.", "11": "A large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside.", "12": "\u201cSend us into the pigs!\u201d they begged. \u201cLet us go into the pigs!\u201d", "13": "Jesus gave them permission, so the unclean spirits left the man and went into the pigs.

People came to see what had happened.", "15": "They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to be demon-possessed.

Please, come and place your hands on her so that she can be healed and live.\u201d", "24": "So Jesus went with him. A swarm of people were following Jesus, crowding in on him.", "25": "A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years.", "26": "She had suffered a lot under the care of many doctors, and had spent everything she had without getting any better.

He turned around in the crowd and said, \u201cWho touched my clothes?\u201d", "31": "His disciples said to him, \u201cDon't you see the crowd pressing against you? Yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'\u201d", "32": "But Jesus looked around carefully to see who had done it.", "33": "The woman, full of fear and trembling, came forward. Knowing what had happened to her, she fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole truth.", "34": "He responded, \u201cDaughter, your faith has healed you; go in peace, healed from your disease.\u201d", "35": "While Jesus was still speaking with her, messengers came from the synagogue leader's house, saying to Jairus, \u201cYour daughter has died. Why bother the teacher any longer?\u201d", "36": "But Jesus overheard their report and said to the synagogue leader, \u201cDon't be afraid; just keep trusting.\u201d", "37": "He didn't allow anyone to follow him except Peter, James, and John, James' brother.", "38": "They came to the synagogue leader's house, and he saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.", "39": "He went in and said to them, \u201cWhat's all this commotion and crying about? The child isn't dead. She's only sleeping.\u201d", "40": "They laughed at him, but he threw them all out. Then, taking the child's parents and his disciples with him, he went to the room where the child was.", "41": "Taking her hand, he said to her, \u201cTalitha koum,\u201d which means, \u201cYoung woman, get up.\u201d", "42": "Suddenly the young woman got up and began to walk around. She was 12 years old. They were shocked!", "43": "He gave them strict orders that no one should know what had happened. Then he told them to give her something to eat."}

{"1": "Jesus began to teach beside the lake again. Such a large crowd gathered that he climbed into a boat there on the lake. He sat in the boat while the whole crowd was nearby on the shore.", "2": "He said many things to them in parables. While teaching them, he said,", "3": "\u201cListen to this! A farmer went out to scatter seed.", "4": "As he was scattering seed, some fell on the path; and the birds came and ate it.", "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow. They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn't deep.", "6": "When the sun came up, it scorched the plants; and they dried up because they had no roots.", "7": "Other seed fell among thorny plants. The thorny plants grew and choked the seeds, and they produced nothing.", "8": "Other seed fell into good soil and bore fruit. Upon growing and increasing, the seed produced in one case a yield of thirty to one, in another case a yield of sixty to one, and in another case a yield of one hundred to one.\u201d", "9": "He said, \u201cWhoever has ears to listen should pay attention!\u201d", "10": "When they were alone, the people around Jesus, along with the Twelve, asked him about the parables.", "11": "He said to them, \u201cThe secret of God's kingdom has been given to you, but to those who are outside everything comes in parables.", "12": "This is so that they can look and see but have no insight, and they can hear but not understand. Otherwise, they might turn their lives around and be forgiven.", "13": "\u201cDon't you understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?", "14": "The farmer scatters the word.", "15": "This is the meaning of the seed that fell on the path: When the word is scattered and people hear it, right away Satan comes and steals the word that was planted in them.", "16": "Here's the meaning of the seed that fell on rocky ground: When people hear the word, they immediately receive it joyfully.", "17": "Because they have no roots, they last for only a little while. When they experience distress or abuse because of the word, they immediately fall away.", "18": "Others are like the seed scattered among the thorny plants. These are the ones who have heard the word;", "19": "but the worries of this life, the false appeal of wealth, and the desire for more things break in and choke the word, and it bears no fruit.", "20": "The seed scattered on good soil are those who hear the word and embrace it. They bear fruit, in one case a yield of thirty to one, in another case sixty to one, and in another case one hundred to one.\u201d", "21": "Jesus said to them, \u201cDoes anyone bring in a lamp in order to put it under a basket or a bed? Shouldn't it be placed on a lampstand?", "22": "Everything hidden will be revealed, and everything secret will come out into the open.", "23": "Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention!\u201d", "24": "He said to them, \u201cListen carefully! God will evaluate you with the same standard you use to evaluate others. Indeed, you will receive even more.", "25": "Those who have will receive more, but as for those who don't have, even what they don't have will be taken away from them.\u201d", "26": "Then Jesus said, \u201cThis is what God's kingdom is like. It's as though someone scatters seed on the ground,", "27": "then sleeps and wakes night and day. The seed sprouts and grows, but the farmer doesn't know how.", "28": "The earth produces crops all by itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full head of grain.", "29": "Whenever the crop is ready, the farmer goes out to cut the grain because it's harvesttime.\u201d", "30": "He continued, \u201cWhat's a good image for God's kingdom? What parable can I use to explain it?", "31": "Consider a mustard seed. When scattered on the ground, it's the smallest of all the seeds on the earth;", "32": "but when it's planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all vegetable plants. It produces such large branches that the birds in the sky are able to nest in its shade.\u201d", "33": "With many such parables he continued to give them the word, as much as they were able to hear.", "34": "He spoke to them only in parables, then explained everything to his disciples when he was alone with them.", "35": "Later that day, when evening came, Jesus said to them, \u201cLet's cross over to the other side of the lake.\u201d", "36": "They left the crowd and took him in the boat just as he was. Other boats followed along.", "37": "Gale-force winds arose, and waves crashed against the boat so that the boat was swamped.", "38": "But Jesus was in the rear of the boat, sleeping on a pillow. They woke him up and said, \u201cTeacher, don't you care that we're drowning?\u201d", "39": "He got up and gave orders to the wind, and he said to the lake, \u201cSilence! Be still!\u201d The wind settled down and there was a great calm.", "40": "Jesus asked them, \u201cWhy are you frightened? Don't you have faith yet?\u201d", "41": "Overcome with awe, they said to each other, \u201cWho then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!\u201d"}

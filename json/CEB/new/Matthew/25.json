{"1": "\u201cAt that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten young bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.", "2": "Now five of them were wise, and the other five were foolish.", "3": "The foolish ones took their lamps but didn't bring oil for them.", "4": "But the wise ones took their lamps and also brought containers of oil.", "5": "\u201cWhen the groom was late in coming, they all became drowsy and went to sleep.", "6": "But at midnight there was a cry, 'Look, the groom! Come out to meet him.'", "7": "\u201cThen all those bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps.", "8": "But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise ones, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps have gone out.'", "9": "\u201cBut the wise bridesmaids replied, 'No, because if we share with you, there won't be enough for our lamps and yours. We have a better idea. You go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'", "10": "But while they were gone to buy oil, the groom came. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding. Then the door was shut.", "11": "\u201cLater the other bridesmaids came and said, 'Lord, lord, open the door for us.'", "12": "\u201cBut he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.'", "13": "\u201cTherefore, keep alert, because you don't know the day or the hour.", "14": "\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who was leaving on a trip.

He said, 'Master, you gave me five valuable coins. Look, I've gained five more.'", "21": "\u201cHis master replied, 'Excellent! You are a good and faithful servant! You've been faithful over a little. I'll put you in charge of much. Come, celebrate with me.'", "22": "\u201cThe second servant also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two valuable coins.

She poured it on Jesus' head while he was sitting at dinner.", "8": "Now when the disciples saw it they were angry and said, \u201cWhy this waste?", "9": "This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor.\u201d", "10": "But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, \u201cWhy do you make trouble for the woman? She's done a good thing for me.", "11": "You always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me.", "12": "By pouring this perfume over my body she's prepared me to be buried.", "13": "I tell you the truth that wherever in the whole world this good news is announced, what she's done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d", "14": "Then one of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests", "15": "and said, \u201cWhat will you give me if I turn Jesus over to you?\u201d They paid him thirty pieces of silver.", "16": "From that time on he was looking for an opportunity to turn him in.", "17": "On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, \u201cWhere do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?\u201d", "18": "He replied, \u201cGo into the city, to a certain man, and say, 'The teacher says, \u201cMy time is near. I'm going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.\u201d'\u201d", "19": "The disciples did just as Jesus instructed them. They prepared the Passover.", "20": "That evening he took his place at the table with the twelve disciples.", "21": "As they were eating he said, \u201cI assure you that one of you will betray me.\u201d", "22": "Deeply saddened, each one said to him, \u201cI'm not the one, am I, Lord?\u201d", "23": "He replied, \u201cThe one who will betray me is the one who dips his hand with me into this bowl.", "24": "The Human One[b] goes to his death just as it is written about him.

He said to the disciples, \u201cStay here while I go and pray over there.\u201d", "37": "When he took Peter and Zebedee's two sons, he began to feel sad and anxious.", "38": "Then he said to them, \u201cI'm very sad. It's as if I'm dying. Stay here and keep alert with me.\u201d", "39": "Then he went a short distance farther and fell on his face and prayed, \u201cMy Father, if it's possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. However\u2014not what I want but what you want.\u201d", "40": "He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping.

Look, here comes my betrayer.\u201d", "47": "While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came. With him was a large crowd carrying swords and clubs. They had been sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.", "48": "His betrayer had given them a sign: \u201cArrest the man I kiss.\u201d", "49": "Just then he came to Jesus and said, \u201cHello, Rabbi.\u201d Then he kissed him.", "50": "But Jesus said to him, \u201cFriend, do what you came to do.\u201d Then they came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him.", "51": "One of those with Jesus reached for his sword. Striking the high priest's slave, he cut off his ear.", "52": "Then Jesus said to him, \u201cPut the sword back into its place. All those who use the sword will die by the sword.", "53": "Or do you think that I'm not able to ask my Father and he will send to me more than twelve battle groups[f] of angels right away?", "54": "But if I did that, how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?\u201d", "55": "Then Jesus said to the crowds, \u201cHave you come with swords and clubs to arrest me, like a thief? Day after day, I sat in the temple teaching, but you didn't arrest me.", "56": "But all this has happened so that what the prophets said in the scriptures might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away.", "57": "Those who arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest. The legal experts and the elders had gathered there.", "58": "Peter followed him from a distance until he came to the high priest's courtyard. He entered that area and sat outside with the officers to see how it would turn out.", "59": "The chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death.", "60": "They didn't find anything they could use from the many false witnesses who were willing to come forward. But finally they found two", "61": "who said, \u201cThis man said, 'I can destroy God's temple and rebuild it in three days.'\u201d", "62": "Then the high priest stood and said to Jesus, \u201cAren't you going to respond to the testimony these people have brought against you?\u201d", "63": "But Jesus was silent. The high priest said, \u201cBy the living God, I demand that you tell us whether you are the Christ, God's Son.\u201d", "64": "\u201cYou said it,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cBut I say to you that from now on you'll see the Human One[g] sitting on the right side of the Almighty[h] and coming on the heavenly clouds.\u201d[i]", "65": "Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \u201cHe's insulting God! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, you've heard his insult against God.", "66": "What do you think?\u201d And they answered, \u201cHe deserves to die!\u201d", "67": "Then they spit in his face and beat him. They hit him", "68": "and said, \u201cProphesy for us, Christ! Who hit you?\u201d", "69": "Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant woman came and said to him, \u201cYou were also with Jesus the Galilean.\u201d", "70": "But he denied it in front of all of them, saying, \u201cI don't know what you are talking about.\u201d", "71": "When he went over to the gate, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, \u201cThis man was with Jesus, the man from Nazareth.\u201d", "72": "With a solemn pledge, he denied it again, saying, \u201cI don't know the man.\u201d", "73": "A short time later those standing there came and said to Peter, \u201cYou must be one of them. The way you talk gives you away.\u201d", "74": "Then he cursed and swore, \u201cI don't know the man!\u201d At that very moment the rooster crowed.", "75": "Peter remembered Jesus' words, \u201cBefore the rooster crows you will deny me three times.\u201dAnd Peter went out and cried uncontrollably."}

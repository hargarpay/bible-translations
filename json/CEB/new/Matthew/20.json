{"1": "\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.", "2": "After he agreed with the workers to pay them a denarion,[a] he sent them into his vineyard.", "3": "\u201cThen he went out around nine in the morning and saw others standing around the marketplace doing nothing.", "4": "He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and I'll pay you whatever is right.'", "5": "And they went. \u201cAgain around noon and then at three in the afternoon, he did the same thing.", "6": "Around five in the afternoon he went and found others standing around, and he said to them, 'Why are you just standing around here doing nothing all day long?'", "7": "\u201c'Because nobody has hired us,' they replied. \u201cHe responded, 'You also go into the vineyard.'", "8": "\u201cWhen evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and moving on finally to the first.'", "9": "When those who were hired at five in the afternoon came, each one received a denarion.", "10": "Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each of them also received a denarion.", "11": "When they received it, they grumbled against the landowner,", "12": "'These who were hired last worked one hour, and they received the same pay as we did even though we had to work the whole day in the hot sun.'", "13": "\u201cBut he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I did you no wrong.

Bowing before him, she asked a favor of him.", "21": "\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked. She responded, \u201cSay that these two sons of mine will sit, one on your right hand and one on your left, in your kingdom.\u201d", "22": "Jesus replied, \u201cYou don't know what you're asking! Can you drink from the cup that I'm about to drink from?\u201d They said to him, \u201cWe can.\u201d", "23": "He said to them, \u201cYou will drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left hand isn't mine to give.

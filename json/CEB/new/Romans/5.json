We even take pride in our problems, because we know that trouble produces endurance,", "4": "endurance produces character, and character produces hope.", "5": "This hope doesn't put us to shame, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.", "6": "While we were still weak, at the right moment, Christ died for ungodly people.", "7": "It isn't often that someone will die for a righteous person, though maybe someone might dare to die for a good person.", "8": "But God shows his love for us, because while we were still sinners Christ died for us.", "9": "So, now that we have been made righteous by his blood, we can be even more certain that we will be saved from God's wrath through him.", "10": "If we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son while we were still enemies, now that we have been reconciled, how much more certain is it that we will be saved by his life?", "11": "And not only that: we even take pride in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, the one through whom we now have a restored relationship with God.", "12": "Just as through one human being sin came into the world, and death came through sin, so death has come to everyone, since everyone has sinned.", "13": "Although sin was in the world, since there was no Law, it wasn't taken into account until the Law came.", "14": "But death ruled from Adam until Moses, even over those who didn't sin in the same way Adam did\u2014Adam was a type of the one who was coming.", "15": "But the free gift of Christ isn't like Adam's failure.

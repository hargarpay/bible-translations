{"1": "So now there isn't any condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.", "2": "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.", "3": "God has done what was impossible for the Law, since it was weak because of selfishness. God condemned sin in the body by sending his own Son to deal with sin in the same body as humans, who are controlled by sin.", "4": "He did this so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us. Now the way we live is based on the Spirit, not based on selfishness.", "5": "People whose lives are based on selfishness think about selfish things, but people whose lives are based on the Spirit think about things that are related to the Spirit.", "6": "The attitude that comes from selfishness leads to death, but the attitude that comes from the Spirit leads to life and peace.", "7": "So the attitude that comes from selfishness is hostile to God. It doesn't submit to God's Law, because it can't.", "8": "People who are self-centered aren't able to please God.", "9": "But you aren't self-centered. Instead you are in the Spirit, if in fact God's Spirit lives in you. If anyone doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, they don't belong to him.", "10": "If Christ is in you, the Spirit is your life because of God's righteousness, but the body is dead because of sin.", "11": "If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your human bodies also, through his Spirit that lives in you.", "12": "So then, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but it isn't an obligation to ourselves to live our lives on the basis of selfishness.", "13": "If you live on the basis of selfishness, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the actions of the body, you will live.", "14": "All who are led by God's Spirit are God's sons and daughters.", "15": "You didn't receive a spirit of slavery to lead you back again into fear, but you received a Spirit that shows you are adopted as his children. With this Spirit, we cry, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d", "16": "The same Spirit agrees with our spirit, that we are God's children.", "17": "But if we are children, we are also heirs. We are God's heirs and fellow heirs with Christ, if we really suffer with him so that we can also be glorified with him.", "18": "I believe that the present suffering is nothing compared to the coming glory that is going to be revealed to us.", "19": "The whole creation waits breathless with anticipation for the revelation of God's sons and daughters.", "20": "Creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice\u2014it was the choice of the one who subjected it\u2014but in the hope", "21": "that the creation itself will be set free from slavery to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of God's children.", "22": "We know that the whole creation is groaning together and suffering labor pains up until now.", "23": "And it's not only the creation. We ourselves who have the Spirit as the first crop of the harvest also groan inside as we wait to be adopted and for our bodies to be set free.", "24": "We were saved in hope. If we see what we hope for, that isn't hope. Who hopes for what they already see?", "25": "But if we hope for what we don't see, we wait for it with patience.", "26": "In the same way, the Spirit comes to help our weakness. We don't know what we should pray, but the Spirit himself pleads our case with unexpressed groans.", "27": "The one who searches hearts knows how the Spirit thinks, because he pleads for the saints, consistent with God's will.", "28": "We know that God works all things together for good for the ones who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose.", "29": "We know this because God knew them in advance, and he decided in advance that they would be conformed to the image of his Son. That way his Son would be the first of many brothers and sisters.", "30": "Those who God decided in advance would be conformed to his Son, he also called. Those whom he called, he also made righteous. Those whom he made righteous, he also glorified.", "31": "So what are we going to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?", "32": "He didn't spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. Won't he also freely give us all things with him?", "33": "Who will bring a charge against God's elect people? It is God who acquits them.", "34": "Who is going to convict them? It is Christ Jesus who died, even more, who was raised, and who also is at God's right side. It is Christ Jesus who also pleads our case for us.", "35": "Who will separate us from Christ's love? Will we be separated by trouble, or distress, or harassment, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?", "36": "As it is written, We are being put to death all day long for your sake. We are treated like sheep for slaughter.[a]", "37": "But in all these things we win a sweeping victory through the one who loved us.", "38": "I'm convinced that nothing can separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord: not death or life, not angels or rulers, not present things or future things, not powers", "39": "or height or depth, or any other thing that is created."}

{"1": "From Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for God's good news.", "2-3": "God promised this good news about his Son ahead of time through his prophets in the holy scriptures. His Son was descended from David.", "4": "He was publicly identified as God's Son with power through his resurrection from the dead, which was based on the Spirit of holiness. This Son is Jesus Christ our Lord.", "5": "Through him we have received God's grace and our appointment to be apostles. This was to bring all Gentiles to faithful obedience for his name's sake.", "6": "You who are called by Jesus Christ are also included among these Gentiles.", "7": "To those in Rome who are dearly loved by God and called to be God's people. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.", "8": "First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the news about your faithfulness is being spread throughout the whole world.", "9": "I serve God in my spirit by preaching the good news about God's Son, and God is my witness that I continually mention you", "10": "in all my prayers. I'm always asking that somehow, by God's will, I might succeed in visiting you at last.", "11": "I really want to see you to pass along some spiritual gift to you so that you can be strengthened.", "12": "What I mean is that we can mutually encourage each other while I am with you. We can be encouraged by the faithfulness we find in each other, both your faithfulness and mine.", "13": "I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that I planned to visit you many times, although I have been prevented from coming until now. I want to harvest some fruit among you, just as I have done among the other Gentiles.", "14": "I have a responsibility both to Greeks and to those who don't speak Greek, both to the wise and to the foolish.", "15": "That's why I'm ready to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.", "16": "I'm not ashamed of the gospel: it is God's own power for salvation to all who have faith in God, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.", "17": "God's righteousness is being revealed in the gospel, from faithfulness[a] for faith,[b] as it is written, The righteous person will live by faith.[c]", "18": "God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodly behavior and the injustice of human beings who silence the truth with injustice.", "19": "This is because what is known about God should be plain to them because God made it plain to them.", "20": "Ever since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities\u2014God's eternal power and divine nature\u2014have been clearly seen, because they are understood through the things God has made. So humans are without excuse.", "21": "Although they knew God, they didn't honor God as God or thank him. Instead, their reasoning became pointless, and their foolish hearts were darkened.", "22": "While they were claiming to be wise, they made fools of themselves.", "23": "They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that look like mortal humans: birds, animals, and reptiles.", "24": "So God abandoned them to their hearts' desires, which led to the moral corruption of degrading their own bodies with each other.", "25": "They traded God's truth for a lie, and they worshipped and served the creation instead of the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.", "26": "That's why God abandoned them to degrading lust. Their females traded natural sexual relations for unnatural sexual relations.", "27": "Also, in the same way, the males traded natural sexual relations with females, and burned with lust for each other. Males performed shameful actions with males, and they were paid back with the penalty they deserved for their mistake in their own bodies.", "28": "Since they didn't think it was worthwhile to acknowledge God, God abandoned them to a defective mind to do inappropriate things.", "29": "So they were filled with all injustice, wicked behavior, greed, and evil behavior. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, deception, and malice. They are gossips,", "30": "they slander people, and they hate God. They are rude and proud, and they brag. They invent ways to be evil, and they are disobedient to their parents.", "31": "They are without understanding, disloyal, without affection, and without mercy.", "32": "Though they know God's decision that those who persist in such practices deserve death, they not only keep doing these things but also approve others who practice them."}

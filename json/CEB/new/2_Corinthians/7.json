{"1": "My dear friends, since we have these promises, let's cleanse ourselves from anything that contaminates our body or spirit so that we make our holiness complete in the fear of God.", "2": "Make room in your hearts for us. We didn't do anything wrong to anyone. We didn't ruin anyone. We didn't take advantage of anyone.", "3": "I'm not saying this to make you feel guilty. I've already said that you are in our hearts so that we die and live together with you.", "4": "I have every confidence in you. I'm terribly proud of you. I'm filled with encouragement. I'm overwhelmed with happiness while in the middle of our problems.", "5": "Even after we arrived in Macedonia, we couldn't rest physically. We were surrounded by problems. There was external conflict, and there were internal fears.", "6": "However, God comforts people who are discouraged, and he comforted us by Titus' arrival.", "7": "We weren't comforted only by his arrival but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your desire to see me, how you were sorry, and about your concern for me, so that I was even happier.", "8": "Even though my letter hurt you, I don't regret it. Well\u2014I did regret it just a bit because I see that that letter made you sad, though only for a short time.", "9": "Now I'm glad\u2014not because you were sad but because you were made sad enough to change your hearts and lives. You felt godly sadness so that no one was harmed by us in any way.", "10": "Godly sadness produces a changed heart and life that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets, but sorrow under the influence of the world produces death.", "11": "Look at what this very experience of godly sadness has produced in you: such enthusiasm, what a desire to clear yourselves of blame, such indignation, what fear, what purpose, such concern, what justice! In everything you have shown yourselves to be innocent in the matter.", "12": "So although I wrote to you, it wasn't for the sake of the one who did wrong, or for the sake of the one who was wronged, but to show you your own enthusiasm for us in the sight of God.", "13": "Because of this we have been encouraged. And in addition to our own encouragement, we were even more pleased at how happy Titus was. His mind has been put at rest by all of you.", "14": "If I've bragged about you to him in any way, I haven't been embarrassed. Instead, our bragging to Titus has also been proven to be true, just like everything we said to you was true.", "15": "His devotion to you is growing even more as he remembers how all of you were obedient when you welcomed him with fear and trembling.", "16": "I'm happy, because I can completely depend on you."}

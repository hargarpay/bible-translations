He has no beginning or end of life, but he's like God's Son and remains a priest for all time.", "4": "See how great Melchizedek was! Abraham, the father of the people, gave him a tenth of everything he captured.", "5": "The descendants of Levi who receive the office of priest have a commandment under the Law to collect a tenth of everything from the people who are their brothers and sisters, though they also are descended from Abraham.", "6": "But Melchizedek, who isn't related to them, received a tenth of everything from Abraham and blessed the one who had received the promises.", "7": "Without question, the less important person is blessed by the more important person.", "8": "In addition, in one case a tenth is received by people who die, and in the other case, the tenth is received by someone who continues to live, according to the record.", "9": "It could be said that Levi, who received a tenth, paid a tenth through Abraham", "10": "because he was still in his ancestor's body when Abraham paid the tenth to Melchizedek.", "11": "So if perfection came through the levitical office of priest (for the people received the Law under the priests), why was there still a need to speak about raising up another priest according to the order of Melchizedek rather than one according to the order of Aaron?", "12": "When the order of the priest changes, there has to be a change in the Law as well.", "13": "The person we are talking about belongs to another tribe, and no one ever served at the altar from that tribe.", "14": "It's clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, but Moses never said anything about priests from that tribe.", "15": "And it's even clearer if another priest appears who is like Melchizedek.", "16": "He has become a priest by the power of a life that can't be destroyed, rather than a legal requirement about physical descent.", "17": "This is confirmed: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.[a]", "18": "On the one hand, an earlier command is set aside because it was weak and useless", "19": "(because the Law made nothing perfect).

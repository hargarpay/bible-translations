It was first announced through the Lord, and then it was confirmed by those who heard him.", "4": "God also vouched for their message with signs, amazing things, various miracles, and gifts from the Holy Spirit, which were handed out the way he wanted.", "5": "God didn't put the world that is coming (the world we are talking about) under the angels' control.", "6": "Instead, someone declared somewhere, What is humanity that you think about them? Or what are the human beings that you care about them?", "7": "For a while you made them lower than angels. You crowned the human beings with glory and honor.", "8": "You put everything under their control.[a] When he puts everything under their control, he doesn't leave anything out of control. But right now, we don't see everything under their control yet.", "9": "However, we do see the one who was made lower in order than the angels for a little while\u2014it's Jesus! He's the one who is now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of his death. He suffered death so that he could taste death for everyone through God's grace.", "10": "It was appropriate for God, for whom and through whom everything exists, to use experiences of suffering to make perfect the pioneer of salvation.

I will praise you in the middle of the assembly.[b]", "13": "He also says, I will rely on him.[c] And also, Here I am with the children whom God has given to me.[d]", "14": "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he also shared the same things in the same way. He did this to destroy the one who holds the power over death\u2014the devil\u2014by dying.", "15": "He set free those who were held in slavery their entire lives by their fear of death.", "16": "Of course, he isn't trying to help angels, but rather he's helping Abraham's descendants.", "17": "Therefore, he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way. This was so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, in order to wipe away the sins of the people.", "18": "He's able to help those who are being tempted, since he himself experienced suffering when he was tempted."}

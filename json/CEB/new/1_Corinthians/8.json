Knowledge makes people arrogant, but love builds people up.", "2": "If anyone thinks they know something, they don't yet know as much as they should know.", "3": "But if someone loves God, then they are known by God.", "4": "So concerning the actual food involved in these sacrifices to false gods, we know that a false god isn't anything in this world, and that there is no God except for the one God.", "5": "Granted, there are so-called \u201cgods,\u201d in heaven and on the earth, as there are many gods and many lords.", "6": "However, for us believers, There is one God the Father. All things come from him, and we belong to him. And there is one Lord Jesus Christ. All things exist through him, and we live through him.", "7": "But not everybody knows this. Some are eating this food as though it really is food sacrificed to a real idol, because they were used to idol worship until now. Their conscience is weak because it has been damaged.", "8": "Food won't bring us close to God. We're not missing out if we don't eat, and we don't have any advantage if we do eat.", "9": "But watch out or else this freedom of yours might be a problem for those who are weak.", "10": "Suppose someone sees you (the person who has knowledge) eating in an idol's temple. Won't the person with a weak conscience be encouraged to eat the meat sacrificed to false gods?", "11": "The weak brother or sister for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge.", "12": "You sin against Christ if you sin against your brothers and sisters and hurt their weak consciences this way.", "13": "This is why, if food causes the downfall of my brother or sister, I won't eat meat ever again, or else I may cause my brother or sister to fall."}

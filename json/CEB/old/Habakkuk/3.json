Though angry, remember compassion.", "3": "God comes from Teman and the holy one from the mountain of Paran. Selah His majesty covers the heavens and his praise fills the earth.", "4": "His radiance is like the sunlight, with rays flashing from his hand. That is the hiding place of his power.", "5": "Pestilence walks in front of him. Plague marches at his feet.", "6": "He stops and measures the earth. He looks and sets out against the nations. The everlasting mountains collapse; the eternal hills bow down; the eternal paths belong to him.", "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan under duress. The curtains of the land of Midian were quaking.", "8": "Was the Lord raging against the rivers? Or was your anger directed against the rivers? Or was your fury directed against the sea when you rode on your horses or rode your chariots to victory?", "9": "You raise up your empty bow, uttering curses for the arrows.[a] Selah With rivers you split open the earth.", "10": "The mountains see you and writhe. A flood of water rushes through. The deep utters its voice; it raises its hands aloft.[b]", "11": "Sun and moon stand still high above.

My lips quiver at the sound. Rottenness enters my bones. I tremble while I stand,[d] while I wait for the day of distress to come against the people who attack us.", "17": "Though the fig tree doesn't bloom, and there's no produce on the vine; though the olive crop withers, and the fields don't provide food; though the sheep are cut off from the pen, and there are no cattle in the stalls;", "18": "I will rejoice in the Lord. I will rejoice in the God of my deliverance.", "19": "The Lord God is my strength. He will set my feet like the deer.

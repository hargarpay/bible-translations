{"1": "A man in the land of Uz was named Job. That man was honest, a person of absolute integrity; he feared God and avoided evil.", "2": "He had seven sons and three daughters,", "3": "and owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a vast number of servants, so that he was greater than all the people of the east.", "4": "Each of his sons hosted a feast in his own house on his birthday. They invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.", "5": "When the days of the feast had been completed, Job would send word[a] and purify his children.[b] Getting up early in the morning, he prepared entirely burned offerings for each one of them, for Job thought, Perhaps my children have sinned and then cursed[c] God in their hearts. Job did this regularly.", "6": "One day the divine beings[d] came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Adversary[e] also came among them.", "7": "The Lord said to the Adversary, \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d The Adversary answered the Lord, \u201cFrom wandering throughout the earth.\u201d", "8": "The Lord said to the Adversary, \u201cHave you thought about my servant Job; surely there is no one like him on earth, a man who is honest, who is of absolute integrity, who reveres God and avoids evil?\u201d", "9": "The Adversary answered the Lord, \u201cDoes Job revere God for nothing?", "10": "Haven't you fenced him in\u2014his house and all he has\u2014and blessed the work of his hands so that his possessions extend throughout the earth?", "11": "But stretch out your hand and strike all he has. He will certainly curse you to your face.\u201d", "12": "The Lord said to the Adversary, \u201cLook, all he has is within your power; only don't stretch out your hand against him.\u201d So the Adversary left the Lord's presence.", "13": "One day Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.", "14": "A messenger came to Job and said: \u201cThe oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were grazing nearby", "15": "when the Sabeans took them and killed the young men with swords.

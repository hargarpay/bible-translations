When he reached David, he fell to the ground, bowing low out of respect.", "3": "\u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d David asked him. \u201cI've escaped from the Israelite army!\u201d he answered.", "4": "\u201cWhat's the report?\u201d David asked him. \u201cTell me!\u201d The man answered, \u201cThe troops fled from the battle! Many of the soldiers have fallen and died. What's more, Saul and his son Jonathan have also died!\u201d", "5": "\u201cHow do you know,\u201d David asked the young man who brought the news, \u201cthat Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\u201d", "6": "The young man who brought the news replied, \u201cI just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and Saul was there, leaning on his spear, with chariots and horsemen closing in on him.", "7": "He turned around and saw me, then he called to me. 'Yes, sir,' I answered.", "8": "'Who are you?' he asked, and I told him, 'I'm an Amalekite.'", "9": "He said to me, 'Please come over here and kill me, because convulsions have come over me but I'm still alive.'[a]", "10": "So I went over to him and killed him, because I knew he couldn't survive after being wounded like that. I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I've brought them here to you, my master.\u201d", "11": "Then David grabbed his clothes and ripped them\u2014and all his soldiers did the same.", "12": "They mourned and cried and fasted until evening for Saul, his son Jonathan, the Lord's army, and the whole house of Israel, because they had died by the sword.", "13": "\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d David asked the young man who brought him the news. \u201cI'm the son of an immigrant,\u201d he answered. \u201cAn Amalekite.\u201d", "14": "Then David said to him, \u201cHow is it that you weren't afraid to raise your hand and destroy the Lord's anointed?\u201d", "15": "Then David called for one of the young servants. \u201cCome here!\u201d he said. \u201cStrike him down!\u201d So the servant struck the Amalekite down, and he died.", "16": "\u201cYour blood is on your own head,\u201d David said to the Amalekite, \u201cbecause your own mouth testified against you when you admitted, 'I killed the Lord's anointed.'\u201d", "17": "Then David sang this funeral song[b] for Saul and his son Jonathan.", "18": "David ordered everyone in Judah to learn the Song of the Bow.[c] (In fact, it is written in the scroll from Jashar.)", "19": "Oh, no, Israel!

He dressed you in crimson with jewels; he decorated your clothes with gold jewelry.", "25": "Look how the mighty warriors have fallen in the midst of battle! Jonathan lies dead on your heights.", "26": "I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan! You were so dear to me! Your love was more amazing to me[h] than the love of women.", "27": "Look how the mighty warriors have fallen! Look how the weapons of war have been destroyed!"}

When David was informed that it was the people of Jabesh-gilead who had buried Saul,", "5": "he sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead. \u201cThe Lord bless you,\u201d he said to them, \u201cfor doing this loyal deed for your master Saul by burying him.", "6": "May the Lord now show you loyal love and faithfulness. I myself will also reward you because you did this.", "7": "So now take courage and be brave\u2014yes, your master Saul is dead, but the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.\u201d", "8": "Meanwhile, Abner, Ner's son, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ishbosheth,[a] Saul's son, and brought him over to Mahanaim.", "9": "There he made him king over Gilead, the Geshurites,[b] Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin\u2014over all Israel.", "10": "Saul's son Ishbosheth was 40 years old when he became king over Israel, and he ruled for two years.

One group sat on one side of the pool; the other sat on the opposite side of the pool.", "14": "Abner said to Joab, \u201cLet's have the young men fight in a contest[c] before us.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d Joab said, \u201clet's do it.\u201d", "15": "So the men came forward and were counted as they passed by: twelve for Benjamin and Ishbosheth, Saul's son; and twelve of David's soldiers.", "16": "Each man grabbed his opponent by the head and stuck[d] his sword into his opponent's side so that they both fell dead together. That's why that place is called The Field of Daggers,[e] which is located in Gibeon.", "17": "A fierce battle took place that day, and Abner and the Israelite troops were defeated by David's soldiers.", "18": "Now Zeruiah's three sons were present at the battle: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast as a gazelle in an open field.", "19": "Asahel went after Abner, staying completely focused in his pursuit of Abner.", "20": "Abner looked behind him and said, \u201cIs that you, Asahel?\u201d \u201cYes, it's me,\u201d Asahel answered.", "21": "\u201cBreak off your pursuit!\u201d Abner told him. \u201cFight one of the young warriors and take his gear for yourself!\u201d But Asahel wouldn't stop chasing him.", "22": "So Abner repeated himself to Asahel: \u201cStop chasing me. Why should I kill you? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?\u201d", "23": "But Asahel wouldn't turn back, so Abner hit him in the stomach with the back end of his spear.

How long before you order the troops to stop chasing their brothers?\u201d", "27": "\u201cAs surely as God lives,\u201d Joab replied, \u201cif you hadn't just said that, the soldiers would have continued after their brothers until morning.\u201d", "28": "Joab blew the trumpet,[f] and all the soldiers stopped. They didn't pursue Israel anymore, nor did they continue to fight.", "29": "Abner and his men then marched all night through the wilderness, crossing the Jordan River and marching all morning[g] until they got to Mahanaim.", "30": "Joab, meanwhile, returned from pursuing Abner and assembled the troops. Nineteen of David's soldiers were counted missing in addition to Asahel.", "31": "But David's soldiers had defeated the Benjaminites, killing three hundred sixty of Abner's soldiers.", "32": "They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb in Bethlehem.

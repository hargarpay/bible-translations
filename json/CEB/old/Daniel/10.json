{"1": "In the third year of Persia's King Cyrus, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. The message was true: there would be a great conflict. Daniel understood the message, having discerned the meaning of the vision.", "2": "During that time, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three weeks.", "3": "I didn't eat any rich foods. Neither meat nor wine passed my lips, and I didn't clean up at all until the three weeks were up.", "4": "Then, on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was on the bank of the great Tigris River,", "5": "I looked up and suddenly saw a man clothed in linen in front of me. He had a brilliant gold belt around his waist,", "6": "and his body was like topaz. His face was like a flash of lightning, and his eyes were like burning torches. His arms and feet looked like polished bronze. When he spoke, it sounded like the roar of a crowd.", "7": "Only I, Daniel, saw this vision. The other people who were with me didn't see it. Despite that, they were terrified and ran away to hide.", "8": "So I was left alone to see this great vision all by myself. All my strength left me. My energy was sapped, and I couldn't stay strong.", "9": "Then I heard the sound of the man's words. When I heard it, I fell into a trance with my face on the ground.", "10": "But then a hand touched me, lifting me up to my hands and knees.", "11": "The man said to me, \u201cDaniel, you are greatly treasured. Now grasp the meaning of what I'm saying to you. And stand up, because I've been sent to you.\u201d As he said this to me, I stood up, shaking.", "12": "Then the man said to me, \u201cDon't be afraid, Daniel, because from the day you first set your mind to understand things and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I've come because of your words!", "13": "For twenty-one days the leader of the Persian kingdom blocked my way. But then Michael, one of the highest leaders, came to help me. I left Michael there with the leader of the Persian kingdom.[a]", "14": "But I've come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the future, because there is another vision concerning that time.\u201d", "15": "While he said this to me, I turned my face to the ground and kept quiet.", "16": "But then someone who looked like a human being[b] touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to the person standing in front of me: \u201cMy lord, the vision bothered me deeply, and I couldn't stay strong during it.", "17": "So how can I, my lord's servant, speak with you, my lord? Even now there's no strength in me, and I can barely breathe.\u201d", "18": "The one who looked like a human being touched me again and gave me strength.", "19": "He said, \u201cDon't be afraid. You are greatly treasured. All will be well with you. Be strong!\u201d As he spoke to me, I suddenly felt strong. Then I said: \u201cMy lord can go on, because you've made me strong.\u201d", "20": "Then he said: \u201cDo you know why I have come to you? Now I must go back to fight the leader of Persia. As I leave, the leader of Greece will come!", "21": "But I will tell you what is written in the Scroll of Truth. No one stands strong with me against these leaders except your leader Michael."}

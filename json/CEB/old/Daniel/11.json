Persia will have three more kings, but the fourth will be richer than all of them. Once he has become strong through his great riches, he will disturb everyone, including the Greek kingdom.", "3": "Then a warrior-king will come forward, ruling over a vast empire and doing whatever he wants.", "4": "But even as he takes control, his kingdom will be broken, divided to the four winds of heaven. It won't pass to his descendants. No one will rule like he did because his kingdom will be uprooted. It will belong to others, not to these.", "5": "\u201cThen the southern king will gain power, but one of his princes will overpower him, ruling in his place. His empire will be vast.", "6": "After some years, they will make an agreement together. The southern king's daughter will go to the northern king to finalize the agreement, but she won't retain her great power. Neither will his power remain in place.

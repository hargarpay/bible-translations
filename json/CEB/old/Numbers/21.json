The people became impatient on the road.", "5": "The people spoke against God and Moses: \u201cWhy did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us in the desert, where there is no food or water. And we detest this miserable bread!\u201d", "6": "So the Lord sent poisonous[c] snakes among the people and they bit the people. Many of the Israelites died.", "7": "The people went to Moses and said, \u201cWe've sinned, for we spoke against the Lord and you.

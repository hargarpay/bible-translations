{"1": "Balaam said to Balak, \u201cBuild me seven altars here and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.\u201d", "2": "Balak did as Balaam had said. Then Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.", "3": "Balaam said to Balak, \u201cStay by your entirely burned offering. I will go and perhaps the Lord will grant me an appearance and speak. Whatever he shows me, I will tell you.\u201d Then he went off to a high outlook.", "4": "God granted Balaam an appearance. Balaam said to him, \u201cI have arranged seven altars and I have sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar.\u201d", "5": "The Lord gave Balaam something to say, and said to him, \u201cReturn to Balak and say this.\u201d", "6": "Balaam returned to him, while he and all the officials of Moab were standing next to his entirely burned offering.", "7": "Then he raised his voice and made his address: \u201cFrom Aram Balak led me, the king of Moab, from the eastern mountains. Come, curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.", "8": "How can I curse whom God hasn't cursed? How can I denounce whom God hasn't denounced?", "9": "From the top of the rocks I see him; from the hills I gaze on him. Here is a people living alone; it doesn't consider itself among the nations.", "10": "Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of those who do right, and let my end be like his.\u201d", "11": "Then Balak said to Balaam, \u201cWhat have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemy. But now you've blessed him.\u201d", "12": "He answered and said, \u201cDon't I have to take care to speak whatever the Lord gives me to say?\u201d", "13": "Then Balak said to Balaam, \u201cCome with me, please, to another place where you'll see them. You'll see only part of them. You won't see all of them. Then curse them for me from there.\u201d", "14": "He took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah. He built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.", "15": "Then Balaam said to Balak, \u201cStand here by your entirely burned offering, while I seek an appearance over there.\u201d", "16": "The Lord granted Balaam an appearance and gave him a message. He said, \u201cReturn to Balak and say this.\u201d", "17": "Balaam approached Balak, who was standing by his entirely burned offering with the officials of Moab. Balak said to him, \u201cWhat did the Lord say?\u201d", "18": "Then Balaam raised his voice and made his address: \u201cArise, Balak, and listen; hear me out, Zippor's son.", "19": "God isn't a man that he would lie, or a human being that he would change his mind. Has he ever spoken and not done it, or promised and not fulfilled it?", "20": "I received a blessing, and he blessed. I can't take it back.", "21": "He hasn't envisioned misfortune for Jacob, nor has he seen trouble for Israel. The Lord his God is with him, proclaimed as his king.", "22": "God, who brought them out of Egypt, is like a magnificent wild bull for him.", "23": "There is no omen against Jacob, no divination against Israel. Instantly it is told to Jacob, and to Israel, what God performs.", "24": "A people now rises like a lioness, like a lion it stands up. It doesn't lie down until it eats the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.\u201d", "25": "Then Balak said to Balaam, \u201cDon't curse them or bless them.\u201d", "26": "But Balaam answered and said to Balak, \u201cDidn't I say to you, 'I'll do whatever the Lord tells me to'?\u201d", "27": "Balak said to Balaam, \u201cPlease come and I'll take you to another place. Perhaps God will prefer it, so that you could curse him for me from there.\u201d", "28": "So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks Jeshimon.[a]", "29": "Balaam said to Balak, \u201cBuild me seven altars here and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.\u201d", "30": "Balak did just as Balaam said. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar."}

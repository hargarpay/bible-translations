Miriam died and was buried there.", "2": "Now there was no water for the community, and they assembled against Moses and Aaron.", "3": "Then the people confronted Moses and said to him, \u201cIf only we too had died when our brothers perished in the Lord's presence!", "4": "Why have you brought the Lord's assembly into this desert to kill us and our animals here?", "5": "Why have you led us up from Egypt to bring us to this evil place without grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates? And there's no water to drink!\u201d", "6": "Moses and Aaron went away from the assembly to the entrance of the meeting tent and they fell on their faces. Then the Lord's glory appeared to them.", "7": "The Lord spoke to Moses:", "8": "\u201cYou and Aaron your brother, take the staff and assemble the community. In their presence, tell the rock to provide water. You will produce water from the rock for them and allow the community and their animals to drink.\u201d", "9": "Moses took the staff from the Lord's presence, as the Lord had commanded him.", "10": "Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. He said to them, \u201cListen, you rebels! Should we produce water from the rock for you?\u201d", "11": "Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice. Out flooded water so that the community and their animals could drink.", "12": "The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cBecause you didn't trust me to show my holiness before the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I am giving them.\u201d", "13": "These were the waters of Meribah,[b] where the Israelites confronted the Lord with controversy and he showed his holiness to them.", "14": "Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: \u201cThis is what your brother Israel says: 'You know all the adversity that has happened to us.", "15": "How our ancestors went down to Egypt and lived in Egypt for a long time. The Egyptians oppressed us as they had our ancestors,", "16": "and we cried out to the Lord. He heard our voice, sent a messenger, and brought us out of Egypt. Now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.", "17": "Please let us cross through your land. We won't pass through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will walk on the King's Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have crossed your border.'\u201d", "18": "Edom said to him, \u201cYou won't cross through, or I will come out against you with a sword.\u201d", "19": "The Israelites said to him, \u201cWe'll go up by the road. If we drink from your water, either we or our livestock, we'll pay for it. It's a small matter. We would only ask to cross on foot.\u201d", "20": "But he said, \u201cYou won't cross.\u201d Then Edom came out against them with a powerful army and a strong hand.", "21": "Edom refused to allow Israel to cross his border.

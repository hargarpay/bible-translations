Take them to the meeting tent, and let them stand there with you.", "17": "Then I'll descend and speak with you there. I'll take some of the spirit that is on you and place it on them.

It let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey all around the camp and about three feet deep on the ground.", "32": "Then the people arose and gathered the quail all that day, all night, and all the next day. The least collected was ten homers,[b] and they laid them out around the camp.", "33": "While the meat was still between their teeth and not yet consumed, the Lord's anger blazed against the people.

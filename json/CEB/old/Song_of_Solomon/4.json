Your hair is like a flock of goats as they stream down Mount Gilead.", "2": "Your teeth are like newly shorn ewes as they come up from the washing pool\u2014 all of them perfectly matched, not one of them lacks its twin.", "3": "Like a crimson ribbon are your lips; when you smile, it is lovely. Like a slice of pomegranate is the curve of your face behind the veil of your hair.", "4": "Like David's tower is your neck, splendidly built! A thousand shields are hung upon it\u2014 all the weapons of the warriors.", "5": "Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle doe, that graze among the lilies.", "6": "Before the day breeze blows and the shadows flee, I will be off to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.", "7": "You are utterly beautiful, my dearest; there's not a single flaw in you.", "8": "Come down with me from Lebanon, my bride\u2014 if only you would come down with me from Lebanon.

You have captured my heart with one glance from your eyes, with one strand of your necklace.", "10": "How beautiful is your loving, my sister, my bride!

Blow upon my garden; let its perfumes flow! Let my love come to his garden; let him eat its luscious fruit!"}

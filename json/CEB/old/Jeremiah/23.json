{"1": "Watch out, you shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, declares the Lord.", "2": "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, proclaims about the shepherds who \u201ctend to\u201d my people: You are the ones who have scattered my flock and driven them away. You haven't attended to their needs, so I will take revenge on you for the terrible things you have done to them, declares the Lord.", "3": "I myself will gather the few remaining sheep from all the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply.", "4": "I will place over them shepherds who care for them. Then they will no longer be afraid or dread harm, nor will any be missing, declares the Lord.", "5": "The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up a righteous descendant[a] from David's line, and he will rule as a wise king. He will do what is just and right in the land.", "6": "During his lifetime, Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And his name will be The Lord Is Our Righteousness.[b]", "7": "So the time is coming, declares the Lord, when no one will say, \u201cAs the Lord lives who brought up the Israelites from the land of Egypt.\u201d", "8": "Instead, they will say, \u201cAs the Lord lives who brought up the descendants of the people of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where he[c] has banished them so that they can live in their own land.\u201d", "9": "As for the prophets: My heart inside me is broken; my body aches.[d] I stagger like a drunk who has had too much wine to drink, because of the Lord and because of God's holy words.", "10": "Because the country teems with adulterers, because of them,[e] yes, because their might isn't right and their way is evil, the land dries up, and the grazing areas in the wilderness wither.[f]", "11": "Both prophet and priest are godless; I even find their evil in my temple, declares the Lord.", "12": "Therefore, they will find themselves on slippery ground and will be thrust into darkness, where they will collapse. I will bring disaster upon them, when their time comes, declares the Lord.", "13": "In the prophets of Samaria I saw something shocking: They prophesied by Baal and led astray my people Israel.", "14": "In the prophets of Jerusalem I saw something horrible: They commit adultery and tell lies. They encourage evildoers so that no one turns from their wickedness. In my eyes, they are no better than Sodom; its people are like Gomorrah.", "15": "Therefore, this is what the Lord of heavenly forces proclaims concerning the prophets: I'm going to feed them bitter food and give them poison to drink. Wickedness has spread from the prophets of Jerusalem throughout the land.", "16": "The Lord proclaims: Don't listen to the prophets who are speaking to you; they are deceiving you. Their visions come from their own hearts, not from the Lord's mouth.", "17": "They keep saying to those who scorn God's message, \u201cAll will go well for you,\u201d and to those who follow their own willful hearts, \u201cNothing bad will happen to you.\u201d", "18": "But who has stood in the Lord's council to listen to God's word? Who has paid attention to his word and announced it?", "19": "Look! The Lord's angry storm breaks out; it whirls around the heads of the wicked.", "20": "The Lord's fierce anger won't turn back until it accomplishes all that he has planned. In the days to come, you will understand what this means.", "21": "I didn't send the prophets, yet they ran anyway. I didn't speak to them, yet they prophesied anyway.", "22": "If they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people; they would have turned them from their evil ways and deeds.", "23": "The Lord declares, Am I a God who is only nearby and not far off?", "24": "Can people hide themselves in secret places so I might not see them? Don't I fill heaven and earth?", "25": "I have heard the prophets prophesying lies in my name. They claim, \u201cI've had a dream; I've had a dream!\u201d", "26": "How long will deceitful prophecies dominate the minds of the prophets? Those prophets are treacherous.", "27": "They scheme to make my people forget me by their dreams that people tell each other, just as their ancestors forgot me because of Baal.", "28": "Let the prophet who has a dream declare it, but let the one who has my word proclaim it faithfully. What a difference between straw and wheat! declares the Lord.", "29": "Isn't my word like fire and like a hammer that shatters rock? declares the Lord.", "30": "Therefore, I'm against the prophets who steal my words from each other, declares the Lord.", "31": "I'm against the prophets who carelessly deliver oracles,[g] declares the Lord.", "32": "I'm against the prophets who dream up lies and then proclaim them, declares the Lord. With their reckless lies, they lead my people astray. I didn't send them; I didn't commission them. They are completely useless to these people, declares the Lord.", "33": "When these people or a prophet or a priest asks you, \u201cWhat is the Lord's message?\u201d[h] say to them, \u201cWhat message? I will cast you off, declares the Lord.\u201d", "34": "I will punish anyone, including prophet or priest, who says, \u201cThis is the Lord's message.\u201d", "35": "This is what you should ask each other: \u201cWhat has the Lord said?\u201d \u201cWhat has the Lord declared?\u201d", "36": "But you are no longer to mention the Lord's message, because everyone thinks they have received a message from the Lord. You destroy the very word of the living God, the Lord of heavenly forces, our God.", "37": "So this is what you should say to the prophet: \u201cWhat has the Lord said to you?\u201d \u201cWhat has the Lord declared?\u201d", "38": "But if you insist on saying, \u201cThis is the Lord's message,\u201d the Lord says to you: Because you have made this claim\u2014this is the Lord's message\u2014when I told you not to proclaim the Lord's message,", "39": "I will lift you up[i] and cast you out of my presence, together with the city that I gave to your ancestors.", "40": "I will make you an object of disgrace and enduring shame that no one will ever forget."}

Therefore, they will fall among the fallen and stumble when I bring disaster, declares the Lord.", "16": "The Lord proclaims: Stop at the crossroads and look around; ask for the ancient paths. Where is the good way? Then walk in it and find a resting place for yourselves. But you[e] said, \u201cWe won't go!\u201d", "17": "Still, I have appointed watchmen to warn you. But you[f] said, \u201cWe won't listen!\u201d", "18": "Therefore, pay attention, nations; take notice, assembly, what is ahead of them.[g]", "19": "Pay attention, earth: I'm bringing disaster upon my people, the fruit of their own devices, because they have ignored my words and they have rejected my teaching.", "20": "What use to me is incense from Sheba or sweet cane from a faraway land?

You will watch as they fall in battle to their enemies. I will hand over all Judah to the king of Babylon, who will exile some to Babylon and slaughter others.", "5": "I will hand over all the wealth of this city, all its goods and valuables, including the treasures of the kings of Judah, to their enemies, who will ransack and pillage and carry it all off to Babylon.", "6": "And you, Pashhur, and all those in your household, will go into captivity. You will be deported to Babylon where you will die. There you will be buried with all your friends to whom you prophesied falsely.\u201d", "7": "Lord, you enticed me, and I was taken in. You were too strong for me, and you prevailed. Now I'm laughed at all the time; everyone mocks me.", "8": "Every time I open my mouth, I cry out and say, \u201cViolence and destruction!\u201d The Lord's word has brought me nothing but insult and injury, constantly.", "9": "I thought, I'll forget him; I'll no longer speak in his name.

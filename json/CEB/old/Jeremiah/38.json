But whoever surrenders to the Babylonians will live; yes, their lives will be spared.", "3": "The Lord proclaims: This city will certainly be handed over to the army of Babylon's king, who will capture it.", "4": "Then the officials said to the king: \u201cThis man must be put to death! By saying such things, he is discouraging the few remaining troops left in the city, as well as all the people. This man doesn't seek their welfare but their ruin!\u201d", "5": "\u201cHe's in your hands,\u201d King Zedekiah said, \u201cfor the king can do nothing to stop you.\u201d", "6": "So they seized Jeremiah, threw him into the cistern of the royal prince Malchiah, within the prison quarters, and lowered him down by ropes.

Ebed-melech lowered them down the cistern by the ropes", "12": "and called to Jeremiah, \u201cPut these old rags and scraps of clothing under your arms and hold on to the ropes.\u201d When Jeremiah did this,", "13": "they pulled him up by the ropes and got him out of the cistern.

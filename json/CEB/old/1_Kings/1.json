She will serve the king and take care of him by lying beside our master the king and keeping him warm.\u201d", "3": "So they looked in every corner of Israel until they found Abishag from Shunem. They brought her to the king.", "4": "She was very beautiful. She cared for the king and served him, but the king didn't have sex with her.", "5": "Adonijah, Haggith's son, bragged about himself and said, \u201cI'll rule as king myself.\u201d He got his own chariot and horses with fifty runners to go in front.", "6": "Now Adonijah's father had never given him direction; he never questioned why Adonijah did what he did. He was very handsome and was born after Absalom.", "7": "He took advice from Joab, Zeruiah's son, and from the priest Abiathar. They assisted Adonijah.", "8": "But Zadok the priest, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, the prophet Nathan, Shimei and his friends, and David's veterans didn't join Adonijah.", "9": "So Adonijah prepared lamb, oxen, and fattened cattle at the Stone of Zoheleth, next to En-rogel. He invited his brothers (the royal princes) and all the citizens of Judah who were the royal servants to come.", "10": "But he didn't invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, David's veterans, or his brother Solomon.", "11": "Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, \u201cDid you hear that Adonijah, Haggith's son, has become king, but our master David doesn't know about it?", "12": "Let me give you some advice on how you and your son Solomon can survive this.", "13": "Go to King David and say, 'Didn't my master the king swear to your servant, \u201cYour son Solomon will certainly rule after me. He will sit on my throne\u201d? Why then has Adonijah become king?'", "14": "While you are speaking there with the king, I'll come along and support your words.\u201d", "15": "So Bathsheba went to the king in his bedroom. The king was very old, and Abishag from Shunem was serving the king.", "16": "Bathsheba bowed down on her face before the king. The king asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d", "17": "She said to him, \u201cYour Majesty, you swore by the Lord your God to your servant, 'Your son Solomon will certainly rule after me.

He invited all the royal princes, the generals, and Abiathar the priest. They are eating and drinking with him, and they said, 'Long live King Adonijah!'", "26": "Adonijah didn't invite me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, or your servant Solomon.", "27": "If this message was from my master the king, you didn't make it known to your servant. Who should follow you on the throne of my master the king?\u201d", "28": "King David answered, \u201cBring me Bathsheba.\u201d She came and stood before the king.", "29": "The king made a solemn pledge and said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, who rescued me from every trouble,", "30": "regarding what I swore to you by the Lord, Israel's God, 'Your son Solomon will certainly succeed me; he will sit on the throne after me'\u2014I'll see that it happens today.\u201d", "31": "Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground. She honored the king and said, \u201cMay my master King David live forever!\u201d", "32": "King David said, \u201cBring me Zadok the priest, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, Jehoiada's son.\u201d They came to the king,", "33": "who said to them, \u201cTake with you the servants of your masters. Put my son Solomon on my mule and bring him down to Gihon.", "34": "There Zadok the priest and the prophet Nathan will anoint him king over Israel.

I have appointed him to become ruler over Israel and Judah.\u201d", "36": "Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, responded to the king, \u201cYes, may it happen as the Lord, the God of my king, says.", "37": "Just as the Lord was with my master the king, so may he be with Solomon. May his throne be even greater than the throne of my master King David.\u201d", "38": "Zadok the priest, the prophet Nathan, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule. They led him to Gihon.", "39": "Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram's horn, and all the people said, \u201cLong live King Solomon!\u201d", "40": "All the people followed him playing flutes and celebrating. The ground shook at their noise.", "41": "Adonijah and all his invited guests heard this when they had finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the ram's horn, he said, \u201cWhat's that noise coming from the city?\u201d", "42": "While he was still speaking, Jonathan, Abiathar the priest's son, arrived. Adonijah said, \u201cCome on in! You are an honest man and will bring a good report.\u201d", "43": "Jonathan replied to Adonijah, \u201cNo! Our master King David has made Solomon king!", "44": "To support him, the king sent along Zadok the priest; the prophet Nathan; Benaiah, Jehoiada's son; and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. They've put Solomon on the royal mule.", "45": "Zadok the priest and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon. They went up from there celebrating so that the city was thrown into a commotion. That is the sound you heard.", "46": "There's more: Solomon has taken over the throne of the kingdom.", "47": "The royal attendants blessed our master King David: 'May your God make Solomon's name better than your name. May God elevate his throne above your throne.'\u201d The king then worshipped on his bed", "48": "and said, \u201cBless Israel's God, the Lord, who today has set my son[a] on my throne, and has allowed my eyes to see it.\u201d", "49": "Trembling with fear, all of Adonijah's guests got up and fled, each going a different way.", "50": "Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he got up and went to grab hold of the horns of the altar.", "51": "Solomon was told, \u201cLook! Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and has grabbed the horns of the altar. He's saying, 'King Solomon must swear to me first that he won't execute his servant with the sword.'\u201d", "52": "Solomon said, \u201cIf he shows himself to be an honorable person, then not a hair of his head will be harmed. But if any evil is found in him, he will die.\u201d", "53": "King Solomon sent word and had him brought down from the altar. He came and bowed down to King Solomon.

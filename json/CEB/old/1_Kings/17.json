Hide by the Cherith Brook that faces the Jordan River.", "4": "You can drink from the brook. I have also ordered the ravens to provide for you there.", "5": "Elijah went and did just what the Lord said. He stayed by the Cherith Brook that faced the Jordan River.", "6": "The ravens brought bread and meat in the mornings and evenings. He drank from the Cherith Brook.", "7": "After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.", "8": "The Lord's word came to Elijah:", "9": "Get up and go to Zarephath near Sidon and stay there. I have ordered a widow there to take care of you.", "10": "Elijah left and went to Zarephath. As he came to the town gate, he saw a widow collecting sticks. He called out to her, \u201cPlease get a little water for me in this cup so I can drink.\u201d", "11": "She went to get some water. He then said to her, \u201cPlease get me a piece of bread.\u201d", "12": "\u201cAs surely as the Lord your God lives,\u201d she replied, \u201cI don't have any food; only a handful of flour in a jar and a bit of oil in a bottle. Look at me. I'm collecting two sticks so that I can make some food for myself and my son. We'll eat the last of the food and then die.\u201d", "13": "Elijah said to her, \u201cDon't be afraid! Go and do what you said. Only make a little loaf of bread for me first. Then bring it to me. You can make something for yourself and your son after that.", "14": "This is what Israel's God, the Lord, says: The jar of flour won't decrease and the bottle of oil won't run out until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth.\u201d", "15": "The widow went and did what Elijah said. So the widow, Elijah, and the widow's household ate for many days.", "16": "The jar of flour didn't decrease nor did the bottle of oil run out, just as the Lord spoke through Elijah.", "17": "After these things, the son of the widow, who was the matriarch of the household, became ill. His sickness got steadily worse until he wasn't breathing anymore.", "18": "She said to Elijah, \u201cWhat's gone wrong between us, man of God?

Elijah laid him on his bed.", "20": "Elijah cried out to the Lord, \u201cLord my God, why is it that you have brought such evil upon the widow that I am staying with by killing her son?\u201d", "21": "Then he stretched himself over the boy three times and cried out to the Lord, \u201cLord my God, please give this boy's life back to him.\u201d", "22": "The Lord listened to Elijah's voice and gave the boy his life back. And he lived.", "23": "Elijah brought the boy down from the upper room of the house and gave him to his mother.

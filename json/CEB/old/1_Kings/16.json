So he died.", "19": "This happened because of the sins Zimri had committed by doing evil in the Lord's eyes and by walking in Jeroboam's ways and the sin he had done by causing Israel to sin.", "20": "The rest of Zimri's deeds and the plot he carried out, aren't they written in the official records of Israel's kings?", "21": "At this time the people of Israel were split in two.

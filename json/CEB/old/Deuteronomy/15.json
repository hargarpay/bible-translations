{"1": "Every seventh year you must cancel all debts.", "2": "This is how the cancellation is to be handled: Creditors will forgive the loans of their fellow Israelites. They won't demand repayment from their neighbors or their relatives because the Lord's year of debt cancellation has been announced.", "3": "You are allowed to demand payment from foreigners, but whatever is owed you from your fellow Israelites you must forgive.", "4": "Of course there won't be any poor persons among you because the Lord will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance,", "5": "but only if you carefully obey the Lord your God's voice, by carefully doing every bit of this commandment that I'm giving you right now.", "6": "Once the Lord your God has blessed you, exactly as he said he would, you will end up lending to many different peoples but won't need to borrow a thing. You will dominate many different peoples, but they won't dominate you.", "7": "Now if there are some poor persons among you, say one of your fellow Israelites in one of your cities in the land that the Lord your God is giving you, don't be hard-hearted or tightfisted toward your poor fellow Israelites.", "8": "To the contrary! Open your hand wide to them. You must generously lend them whatever they need.", "9": "But watch yourself! Make sure no wicked thought crosses your mind, such as, The seventh year is coming\u2014the year of debt cancellation\u2014so that you resent your poor fellow Israelites and don't give them anything. If you do that, they will cry out to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.", "10": "No, give generously to needy persons. Don't resent giving to them because it is this very thing that will lead to the Lord your God's blessing you in all you do and work at.", "11": "Poor persons will never disappear from the earth.

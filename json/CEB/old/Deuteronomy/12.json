Burn their sacred poles[a] with fire. Hack their gods' idols into pieces. Wipe out their names from that place.", "4": "Don't act like they did toward the Lord your God!", "5": "Instead, you must search for the location the Lord your God will select from all your tribes to put his name there, as his residence, and you must go there.", "6": "You must bring your entirely burned offerings, your sacrifices, your tenth-part gifts, your contributions,[b] your payments for solemn promises, your spontaneous gifts, and the oldest offspring of your herds and flocks to that place.", "7": "You will have a feast there, each of you and your families, in the Lord your God's presence, and you will celebrate all you have done because the Lord your God has blessed you.", "8": "Don't act like we've been acting here lately\u2014everyone doing what seems right to them\u2014", "9": "because up to this point you haven't yet reached the place of rest or the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you.", "10": "But you are about to cross the Jordan River and will settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.

Don't be trapped by following their practices after they've been wiped out before you. Don't go investigating their gods, thinking, How did these nations worship their gods? I want to do the very same thing!", "31": "Don't act like they did toward the Lord your God because they did things for their gods that are detestable to the Lord, which he hates. They even burned their own sons and daughters with fire for their gods!", "32": "[c] Everything I'm commanding you, you must do it with utmost care!

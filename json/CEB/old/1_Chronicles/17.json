I've been traveling from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.[c]", "6": "Throughout my traveling with the Israelites, did I ever ask one of Israel's tribal leaders, whom I appointed to shepherd my people, Why haven't you built me a cedar temple?", "7": "So then, say this to my servant David: This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says: I myself took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be leader over my people Israel.", "8": "I've been with you wherever you've gone. I've eliminated all your enemies before you. Now I will make your name great\u2014like the name of the greatest people on earth.", "9": "I'm going to provide a place for my people Israel, and plant them so that they may live there and no longer be disturbed.

{"1": "But I said: Hear, leaders of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel! Isn't it your job to know justice?\u2014", "2": "you who hate good and love evil, who tear the skin off them, and the flesh off their bones,", "3": "who devour the flesh of my people, tear off their skin, break their bones in pieces, and spread them out as if in a pot, like meat in a kettle.", "4": "Then they will cry out to the Lord, but he won't answer them. He will hide his face from them at that time, because of their evil deeds.", "5": "The Lord proclaims concerning the prophets, those who lead my people astray, those who chew with their teeth and then proclaim \u201cPeace!\u201d but stir up war against the one who puts nothing in their mouths:", "6": "Therefore, it will become night for you, without vision, only darkness without divination! The sun will set on the prophets; the day will be dark upon them.", "7": "Those seeing visions will be ashamed, and the diviners disgraced; they will all cover their upper lips,[a] for there will be no answer from God.", "8": "But me! I am filled with power, with the spirit of the Lord, with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his wrongdoing and to Israel his sin!", "9": "Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel, you who reject justice and make crooked all that is straight,", "10": "who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with injustice!", "11": "Her officials give justice for a bribe, and her priests teach for hire. Her prophets offer divination for silver, yet they rely on the Lord, saying, \u201cIsn't the Lord in our midst? Evil won't come upon us!\u201d", "12": "Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become piles of rubble, and the temple mount will become an overgrown mound."}

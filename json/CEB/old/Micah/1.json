{"1": "The Lord's word that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Judah's Kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:", "2": "Listen, all you peoples! Pay attention, earth, and all that fills it! May the Lord God be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.", "3": "Look! The Lord is coming out from his place; he will go down and tread on the shrines of the earth.", "4": "Then the mountains will melt under him; the valleys will split apart, like wax yielding to the fire, like waters poured down a slope.", "5": "All this is for the crime of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel. Who is responsible for the crime of Jacob?[a] Isn't it Samaria? Who is responsible for[b] the shrines of Judah? Isn't it Jerusalem?", "6": "So I will make Samaria a pile of rubble in the open field, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley; her foundations I will lay bare.", "7": "All her images will be beaten to pieces; all her wages will be burned; I will make all her idols worthless. Since she gathered them from the wages of a prostitute, they will again become wages of a prostitute.", "8": "On account of this, I will cry out and howl; I will go about barefoot and stripped. I will cry out like the jackals, and mourn like the ostriches.", "9": "Indeed, Zion has been weakened by her wounds! It has come as far as Judah; he has struck as far as the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem.", "10": "In Gath tell it not; no need to weep there![c] In Beth-le-aphrah, roll yourself in the dust!", "11": "Pass by (for your sake),[d] inhabitants of Shaphir! In nakedness and shame she will not go out, inhabitants of Zaanan. The cry of Beth-ezel will take away from you[e] any place to stand.", "12": "How she longs for good, inhabitants of Maroth! Calamity has come down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.", "13": "Harness the horses to the chariot, inhabitants of Lachish! It was the beginning of sin for Daughter Zion; the crimes of Israel have been found in you.", "14": "Therefore, you will give good-bye gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib have become a deception for the kings of Israel.", "15": "Again I will bring to you the one who conquers, inhabitants of Mareshah; the glory of Israel will come as far as Adullam.", "16": "Make yourself bald and cut off your hair because of your cherished children! Make yourself as bald as the vulture, for they have gone from you into exile."}

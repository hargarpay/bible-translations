The more his fruit increased, the more altars he built; the richer his land became, the more he set up sacred standing stones.", "2": "Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. The Lord will break down their altars and destroy their standing stones.", "3": "For now they will say: \u201cWe have no king, because we don't love the Lord. What then could a king do for us?\u201d", "4": "They have spoken empty words, swearing falsely when making covenants; so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.", "5": "The inhabitants of Samaria shake because of the calf of Beth-aven. Its people will mourn over it, just as its idolatrous priests who rejoiced over its glory that is now gone.", "6": "To Assyria it will be carried as a gift for the great king. Ephraim will be put to shame; Israel will be ashamed of his own idol.", "7": "Samaria will be cut off; her king is like a chip of wood on the surface of the water.", "8": "The sin of Israel, the shrines of Aven will be torn down. Thorn and thistle will sprout up on their altars. They will say to the mountains, \u201cCover us,\u201d to the hills, \u201cFall on us.\u201d", "9": "Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel; there they have continued.

At dawn, the king of Israel will be cut off completely."}

I treated them like those who lift infants to their cheeks; I bent down to them and fed them.", "5": "They will return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria will be their king, because they have refused to return to me.", "6": "The sword will strike wildly in their cities; it will consume the bars of their gates and will take everything because of their schemes.", "7": "My people are bent on turning away from me; and though they cry out to the Most High,[a] he will not raise them up.", "8": "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim?

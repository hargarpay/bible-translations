{"1": "[a] Say to your brother, My People, and to your sister, Compassion:", "2": "Level a charge against your mother; plead with her! She is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove prostitution from her presence, and adultery from between her breasts,", "3": "or else I will strip her naked and expose her as on the day she was born. I will make her like a desert, and turn her into a dry land, and make her die of thirst.", "4": "I will also have no compassion on her children because they are children of prostitution.", "5": "Their mother has played the prostitute; she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. She said, \u201cI will seek out my lovers; they give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen cloth, my oil and my drink.\u201d", "6": "Therefore, I will line her path with thorns; and I will build a wall against her, so that she can't find her paths.", "7": "She will go after her lovers, but she won't catch up with them; she will seek them, but she won't find them. Then she will say, \u201cI will return to my first husband, for I had it better then than now.\u201d", "8": "She didn't know that I gave her the corn, the new wine, and the fresh oil, and that I gave her much silver, and gold that they used for Baal.", "9": "So now I will take back my corn in its time, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my linen cloth, which were to cover her nakedness.", "10": "Now I will uncover her nakedness in plain view of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from me.", "11": "I will end all her religious celebrations, her festivals, her new moons, her Sabbath days, and all her sacred seasons.", "12": "I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, \u201cThese are my pay, which my lovers have given to me.\u201d I will change them into a forest, and the wild animals will eat them.", "13": "I will punish her for the days dedicated to the Baals, when she offered sweet-smelling sacrifices to them and dressed herself up with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the Lord.", "14": "Therefore, I will charm her, and bring her into the desert, and speak tenderly to her heart.", "15": "From there I will give her vineyards, and make the Achor Valley a door of hope. There she will respond to me as in the days of her youth, like the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.", "16": "On that day, says the Lord, you will call me, \u201cMy husband,\u201d and no longer will you call me, \u201cMy Lord.\u201d", "17": "I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they will not be mentioned by name anymore.", "18": "On that day, I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the creeping creatures of the fertile ground. I will do away with the bow, the sword, and war from the land; I will make you lie down in safety.", "19": "I will take you for my wife forever; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice, in devoted love, and in mercy.", "20": "I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you will know the Lord.", "21": "On that day I will answer, says the Lord. I will answer the heavens and they will answer the earth.", "22": "The earth will answer the corn, the new wine, and the fresh oil, and they will answer Jezreel;", "23": "I will sow him for myself in the land; and I will have compassion on No Compassion, and I will say to Not My People, \u201cYou are my people\u201d; and he will say, \u201cYou are my God.\u201d"}

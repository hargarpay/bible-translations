The Lord is vengeful against his foes; he rages against his enemies.", "3": "The Lord is very patient but great in power; the Lord punishes. His way is in whirlwind and storm; clouds are the dust of his feet.", "4": "He can blast the sea and make it dry up; he can dry up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither; the bud of Lebanon withers.", "5": "The mountains quake because of him; the hills melt away. The earth heaves before him\u2014 the world and all who dwell in it.", "6": "Who can stand before his indignation? Who can confront the heat of his fury? His wrath pours out like fire; the rocks are shattered because of him.", "7": "The Lord is good, a haven in a day of distress.

I will remove carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods; I will make your grave, for you are worthless.", "15": "[d] Look, on the mountains: the feet of a messenger who announces peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah! Fulfill your solemn promises! The worthless one will never again invade you; he has been completely cut off."}

I am against you, proclaims the Lord of heavenly forces. I will lift your skirts over your face; I will show nations your nakedness and kingdoms your dishonor.", "6": "I will throw disgusting things at you; I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.", "7": "Then all who look at you will recoil from you and say, \u201cNineveh has been devastated! Who will lament for her?\u201d Where could I possibly seek comforters for you?", "8": "Are you better than Thebes, situated by the Nile, waters surrounding her, whose fortress is sea and whose city wall is waters?", "9": "Cush[a] and Egypt constituted her strength, without limit; Put and the Libyans were her[b] help.", "10": "Yet even she was destined for exile; she went into captivity. Indeed, her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her officials; all of her powerful citizens were bound in chains.", "11": "Yes, even you will become drunk; you will have to hide!

Tread the clay, trample the mortar, grab the brick mold!", "15": "Fire will consume you there; the sword will cut you down; like the locust it will consume you. Multiply like the locust; multiply like the grasshopper!", "16": "You boasted more traders than the heavens have stars. The locust sheds its skin and flies away.", "17": "Your guards are like grasshoppers, your marshals like swarms of cicadas that encamp on stone fences on a chilly day; when the sun rises, they take flight; no one knows where they have gone.", "18": "Your shepherds have fallen asleep, king of Assyria! Your officials are lying down. Your people are scattered across the mountains; there is no one to gather them.", "19": "There is no remedy for your injury; your wound is grievous. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. Who has not suffered from your continual cruelty?"}

{"1": "Hear my words, Lord! Consider my groans!", "2": "Pay attention to the sound of my cries, my king and my God, because I am praying to you!", "3": "Lord, in the morning you hear my voice. In the morning I lay it all out before you. Then I wait expectantly.", "4": "Because you aren't a God who enjoys wickedness; evil doesn't live with you.", "5": "Arrogant people won't last long in your sight; you hate all evildoers;", "6": "you destroy liars. The Lord despises people who are violent and dishonest.", "7": "But me? I will enter your house because of your abundant, faithful love; I will bow down at your holy temple, honoring you.", "8": "Lord, because of many enemies, please lead me in your righteousness. Make your way clear, right in front of me.", "9": "Because there's no truth in my enemies' mouths, all they have inside them is destruction. Their throats are open graves; their tongues slick with talk.", "10": "Condemn them, God! Let them fail by their own plans. Throw them out for their many sins because they've rebelled against you.", "11": "But let all who take refuge in you celebrate. Let them sing out loud forever! Protect them so that all who love your name can rejoice in you.", "12": "Because you, Lord, bless the righteous. You cover them with favor like a shield."}

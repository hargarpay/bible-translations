They've made Jerusalem a bunch of ruins.", "2": "They've left your servants' bodies as food for the birds; they've left the flesh of your faithful to the wild animals of the earth.", "3": "They've poured out the blood of the faithful like water all around Jerusalem, and there's no one left to bury them.", "4": "We've become a joke to our neighbors, nothing but objects of ridicule and disapproval to those around us.", "5": "How long will you rage, Lord? Forever? How long will your anger burn like fire?", "6": "Pour out your wrath on the nations who don't know you, on the kingdoms that haven't called on your name.", "7": "They've devoured Jacob and demolished his pasture.", "8": "Don't remember the iniquities of past generations; let your compassion hurry to meet us because we've been brought so low.", "9": "God of our salvation, help us for the glory of your name! Deliver us and cover our sins for the sake of your name!", "10": "Why should the nations say, \u201cWhere's their God now?\u201d Let vengeance for the spilled blood of your servants be known among the nations before our very eyes!", "11": "Let the prisoners' groaning reach you.

We will give you thanks forever; we will proclaim your praises from one generation to the next."}

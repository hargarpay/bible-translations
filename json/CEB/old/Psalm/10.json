{"1": "Why do you stand so far away, Lord, hiding yourself in troubling times?", "2": "Meanwhile, the wicked are proudly in hot pursuit of those who suffer. Let them get caught in the very same schemes they've thought up!", "3": "The wicked brag about their body's[b] cravings; the greedy reject the Lord, cursing.", "4": "At the peak of their wrath, the wicked don't seek God: There's no God\u2014 that's what they are always thinking.", "5": "Their ways are always twisted. Your rules are too lofty for them. They snort at all their foes.", "6": "They think to themselves, We'll never stumble. We'll never encounter any resistance.", "7": "Their mouths are filled with curses, dishonesty, violence. Under their tongues lie troublemaking and wrongdoing.", "8": "They wait in a place perfect for ambush;[c] from their hiding places they kill innocent people; their eyes spot those who are helpless.", "9": "They lie in ambush in secret places, like a lion in its lair. They lie in ambush so they can seize those who suffer! They seize the poor, all right, dragging them off in their nets.", "10": "Their helpless victims are crushed; they collapse, falling prey to the strength of the wicked.", "11": "The wicked think to themselves: God has forgotten. God has hidden his face. God never sees anything!", "12": "Get up, Lord! Get your fist ready, God! Don't forget the ones who suffer!", "13": "Why do the wicked reject God? Why do they think to themselves that you won't find out?", "14": "But you do see! You do see troublemaking and grief, and you do something about it! The helpless leave it all to you. You are the orphan's helper.", "15": "Break the arms of those who are wicked and evil. Seek out their wickedness until there's no more to find.", "16": "The Lord rules forever and always! The nations will vanish from his land.", "17": "Lord, you listen to the desires of those who suffer. You steady their hearts; you listen closely to them,", "18": "to establish justice for the orphan and the oppressed, so that people of the land will never again be terrified."}

As I watched, he went in.", "3": "Now the winged creatures were standing to the right of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard.", "4": "Then the Lord's glory rose from above the winged creatures[b] and moved toward the temple's threshold. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the Lord's glory.", "5": "The sound of the winged creatures' wings could be heard as far as the outer courtyard. It was like the sound of God Almighty[c] when he speaks.", "6": "When he instructed the man clothed in linen to take fire from between the winged creatures and their wheels, the man went and stood next to the wheel.", "7": "Then one of the winged creatures stretched a hand between the winged creatures into the fire that was between them, and he drew out some of it and set it in the palm of the one clothed in linen.

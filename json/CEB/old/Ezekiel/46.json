{"1": "The Lord God proclaims: The east-facing gate of the inner courtyard will remain closed for the six days of the workweek. But on the Sabbath and on the day of the new moon it will be opened,", "2": "and the prince will come in from outside by way of the porch of the gate and stand at the gate's doorposts. The priests will present the prince's entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices, and then he will bow down on the threshold of the gate and go out. The gate won't be closed until evening", "3": "so that the people of the land may bow in the presence of the Lord on sabbaths and new moons at the opening of that gate.", "4": "On the Sabbath day, the prince will offer to the Lord an entirely burned offering of six flawless lambs and a flawless ram,", "5": "a grain offering of one ephah for the ram, and a grain offering at his discretion for the lambs, with one hin of oil for each ephah.", "6": "For the day of the new moon, the offering will be a flawless young bull from the herd, six lambs, and a flawless ram,", "7": "and he will provide a grain offering of one ephah each for the bull and the ram, and for the lambs as much as he likes, with one hin of oil for each ephah.", "8": "When the prince enters, he comes in by way of the porch of the gate and goes out in the same direction.", "9": "When the people of the land come into the Lord's presence for the festivals, those who enter through the north gate to worship should go out through the south, and those who come in through the south gate should go out through the north gate. They shouldn't turn around and go out the same way they came in. Instead, they should go out the opposite gate.", "10": "The prince should accompany them: when they come in, he comes in, and when they go out, he goes out.", "11": "At the festivals and appointed gatherings, the grain offering is one ephah for each bull, one ephah for each ram, and whatever one is able to give for each lamb, with one hin of oil for each ephah.", "12": "Whenever the prince makes a spontaneous gift to the Lord, whether it is an entirely burned offering or a well-being sacrifice, the gate facing east will be opened for him, and he will present his entirely burned offering and well-being sacrifices, just as he does on the Sabbath day. When he leaves, the gate will be closed after he has gone out.", "13": "As a daily entirely burned offering for the Lord, you will provide a flawless year-old lamb. You will make the offering every morning.", "14": "You will provide a grain offering along with it every morning, one-sixth of an ephah along with one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the choice flour. This is a permanent and perpetual regulation for the grain offering to the Lord.", "15": "So the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil are provided every morning as a perpetual entirely burned offering.", "16": "The Lord God proclaims: When the prince gives a gift to each of his sons, it becomes their inheritance. It becomes their family property as an inheritance.", "17": "And if he gives one of his servants a gift from his inheritance, it will belong to the servant only until the year of release, and then it will revert to the prince. It is his children's inheritance; it belongs to them.", "18": "The prince won't take the people's inheritance by evicting them from their family property. He will bequeath only his own property to his sons, lest any of my people be deprived of their rightful property.", "19": "Then he brought me through the passage beside the gate next to the priests' quarters, the holy chambers facing north. There was a place hidden away on the western side.", "20": "He said to me, \u201cRather than taking these offerings out into the outer courtyard and transferring holiness to the people, this is the place where the priests will boil the compensation offerings and the purification offerings, and where they will bake the grain offerings.\u201d", "21": "Then he took me to the outer courtyard, and he had me pass through its four corners, and I saw that there were additional courtyards in each of the corners.", "22": "In all four corners of the courtyard, these courtyards were constructed to handle smoke. All four were the same size, sixty feet long by forty-five feet wide.", "23": "All four had stone masonry all the way around, and hearths were built under this masonry all the way around.", "24": "He said to me, \u201cThese are the kitchens where those who minister in the temple cook the people's sacrifices.\u201d"}

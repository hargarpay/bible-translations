{"1": "When some of the elders of the house of Israel came to sit in my presence,", "2": "the Lord's word came to me:", "3": "Human one, these men decide on their own to set up their idols, so the cause of their downfall is right in front of them. Why should I allow them to ask me anything?", "4": "Therefore, speak to them and tell them, The Lord God proclaims: If anyone from the house of Israel decides on his own to set up his idols and puts the cause of his downfall right in front of him, but then comes to the prophet, I, the Lord, will require an answer from him through his many idols.", "5": "So I'll seize the hearts of the house of Israel, whose idols have made them all strangers to me.", "6": "Therefore, say to the house of Israel, The Lord God proclaims: Come back! Turn away from your idols and from all your detestable practices. Turn away!", "7": "Or anyone of the house of Israel or any immigrant in Israel who becomes estranged from me by deciding on their own to set up their idols and puts the cause of their downfall right in front of them, but then comes to the prophet to ask me something through him, I, the Lord, will require an answer.", "8": "I will confront that one. I will set them up as a sign and an object lesson, and I will cut them off from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord.", "9": "As for the prophet who was seduced into speaking a word, even though it was I, the Lord, who seduced that prophet, I will use my power against him and cut him off completely from my people Israel.", "10": "The prophet and the inquirer alike will bear their guilt,", "11": "so that the house of Israel won't stray away from me again or make themselves impure with any of their sins. They will be my people, and I will be their God. This is what the Lord God says!", "12": "The Lord's word came to me:", "13": "Human one, suppose a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, so that I use my power against it, break off its food supply, let famine run rampant, and eliminate both humans and animals.", "14": "If these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, lived there, their lives alone would be saved because they were righteous. This is what the Lord God says.", "15": "Or suppose I allow wild animals to roam through the land, and it becomes so wild that no one can live there or even travel through it on account of the wild animals.", "16": "If these three men lived there, as surely as I live, proclaims the Lord God, they wouldn't be able to rescue even their sons or daughters. They alone would be rescued, but the land would become a ruin.", "17": "Or suppose I bring a sword against that land and command the sword to pass through and eliminate both humans and animals.", "18": "If these three men lived there, as surely as I live, proclaims the Lord God, they wouldn't be able to rescue even their sons or daughters. They alone would be rescued.", "19": "Or suppose I send a plague against that land and pour out my fury on it. With great bloodshed I would eliminate both humans and animals.", "20": "If Noah, Daniel, and Job lived there, as surely as I live, proclaims the Lord God, they wouldn't be able to rescue either sons or daughters. But they would save their lives because they were righteous.", "21": "The Lord God proclaims: How much more if I send all four of these terrible acts of judgment\u2014sword, famine, wild animals, and plague\u2014against Jerusalem, to eliminate both humans and animals?", "22": "Yet a few survivors will be left. Sons and daughters will be brought out to you. When you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the evil that I inflicted on Jerusalem, for all that I brought against it.", "23": "Seeing their ways and their deeds will bring you some consolation, because then you will understand what I've done, and that I didn't do any of these things without cause. This is what the Lord God says."}

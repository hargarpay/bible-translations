{"1": "You, raise a lament for Israel's princes.", "2": "Say: What a lioness among lionesses was your mother! She bedded down among the strong young lions and reared her cubs.", "3": "She singled out one of her cubs and he became a strong young lion; he learned to tear flesh and devour humans.", "4": "When the nations heard about him, they caught him in their trap and carried him with hooks to the land of Egypt.", "5": "When she realized that she waited in vain, her hope faded. So she took another of her cubs and set him up as a strong young lion.", "6": "He went on the prowl with the other lions and became a strong young lion. He learned to tear flesh and devour humans;", "7": "he ravaged[a] their widows and laid waste to their cities. When the earth and everything in it became horrified by the sound of his raging,", "8": "the nations from the surrounding regions allied against him. They cast their nets over him and caught him in their trap.", "9": "They put a collar on him and brought him with hooks. They brought him with nets to the king of Babylon so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.", "10": "Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard[b] planted beside the waters; she bore lush fruit and foliage because of the plentiful water,", "11": "and she produced mighty branches, fit for rulers' scepters. She grew tall, and her crown went up between the clouds. Because of her height and thick growth, she became conspicuous.", "12": "So she was struck down in anger, thrown down to the ground. The east wind dried her out and destroyed her fruit; it sapped the branch of its strength, and fire consumed it.", "13": "So now she is planted in the desert, in a parched and thirsty land,", "14": "and fire has gone out from her branch and consumed her foliage and fruit, leaving her no strong branch or ruler's scepter. This is a lamentation, and it will serve as a lamentation."}

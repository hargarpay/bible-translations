This is the day that I spoke about.", "9": "Those who live in Israel's cities will go out and kindle a fire with the weapons\u2014shield and buckler, bow and arrow, spear and lance. They will burn them with fire for seven years.", "10": "They won't gather wood from the field or chop down trees from the forest, because they will be able to keep the fire burning with the weapons. So they will take plunder and seize loot. This is what the Lord says.", "11": "On that day, I will assign Gog a place for burial in Israel in the Travelers' Valley east of the sea. It will block the travelers' way, because Gog and all of his horde will be buried there.

Come together from all around for the sacrifice that I make for you, a great sacrifice on Israel's mountains! You will eat flesh and drink blood.", "18": "You will eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth: rams, lambs, goats, bulls, all fattened animals from Bashan.", "19": "Gorge yourselves on their fat, and get drunk on their blood, from the sacrifice that I have made for you.", "20": "Satisfy yourselves at my table with horses and riders, mighty men and every warrior.

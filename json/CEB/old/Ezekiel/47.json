{"1": "When he brought me back to the temple's entrance, I noticed that water was flowing toward the east from under the temple's threshold (the temple faced east). The water was going out from under the temple's facade toward the south, south of the altar.", "2": "He led me out through the north gate and around the outside to the outer east gate, where the water flowed out under the facade on the south side.", "3": "With the line in his hand, the man went out toward the east. When he measured off fifteen hundred feet, he made me cross the water; it was ankle-deep.", "4": "He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and made me cross the water; it was knee-deep. He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and made me cross the water, and it was waist-high.", "5": "When he measured off another fifteen hundred feet, it had become a river that I couldn't cross. The water was high, deep enough for swimming but too high to cross.", "6": "He said to me, \u201cHuman one, do you see?\u201d Then he led me back to the edge of the river.", "7": "When I went back, I saw very many trees on both banks of the river.", "8": "He said to me, \u201cThese waters go out to the eastern region, flow down the steep slopes,[a] and go into the Dead Sea.[b] When the flowing waters enter the sea, its water becomes fresh.", "9": "Wherever the river flows, every living thing that moves will thrive. There will be great schools of fish, because when these waters enter the sea, it will be fresh. Wherever the river flows, everything will live.", "10": "People will stand fishing beside it, from En-gedi to En-eglayim, and it will become a place for spreading nets. It will be like the Mediterranean Sea,[c] having all kinds of fish in it.", "11": "Its marshes and swamps won't be made fresh (they are left for salt),", "12": "but on both banks of the river will grow up all kinds of fruit-bearing trees. Their leaves won't wither, and their fruitfulness won't wane. They will produce fruit in every month, because their water comes from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for eating, their leaves for healing.\u201d", "13": "The Lord God proclaims: These[d] are the boundaries of the portions of land that will be distributed as an inheritance to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph will receive two portions.", "14": "What I swore to give to your ancestors, you will distribute as an inheritance equally. This land is given to you as an inheritance.", "15": "This is the boundary of the land. The northern limit begins at the Mediterranean Sea and goes in the direction of Hethlon toward Lebo-hamath, Zedad,[e]", "16": "Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath), and Hazer-hatticon (that is on the boundary of Hauran).", "17": "So the boundary from the Mediterranean Sea[f] to Hazar-enon will run north of the boundary of Damascus, with the boundary of Hamath to the north. This is the northern limit.", "18": "For the eastern limit, you will measure continuously between Hauran and Damascus and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan River as far as the Dead Sea.[g] This is the eastern limit.", "19": "The southern limit runs from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh and from there along the border[h] of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the southern limit.", "20": "For the western limit, the Mediterranean Sea is the boundary up to Lebo-hamath. This is the western limit.", "21": "You will apportion this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.", "22": "When you distribute the land as an inheritance, the immigrants who reside with you and raise families among you are considered full citizens along with the Israelites. They will receive an inheritance along with you among the tribes of Israel.", "23": "You will assign the immigrants' inheritance with the tribe with whom they reside. This is what the Lord God says."}

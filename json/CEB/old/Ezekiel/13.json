Even though the Lord didn't send them, they said, \u201cThis is what the Lord says\u201d and expected their word to stand.", "7": "Didn't you see worthless visions? And didn't you report deceptive divinations and say, \u201cThis is what the Lord says,\u201d even though I didn't speak?", "8": "Therefore, the Lord God proclaims: Because you spoke worthless things and had false visions, I'm against you.

I will raze it to the ground and expose its foundation.

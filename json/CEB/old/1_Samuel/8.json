They served as judges in Beer-sheba.", "3": "But Samuel's sons didn't follow in his footsteps. They tried to turn a profit, they accepted bribes, and they perverted justice.", "4": "So all the Israelite elders got together and went to Samuel at Ramah.", "5": "They said to him, \u201cListen. You are old now, and your sons don't follow in your footsteps. So appoint us a king to judge us like all the other nations have.\u201d", "6": "It seemed very bad to Samuel when they said, \u201cGive us a king to judge us,\u201d so he prayed to the Lord.", "7": "The Lord answered Samuel, \u201cComply with the people's request\u2014everything they ask of you\u2014because they haven't rejected you. No, they've rejected me as king over them.", "8": "They are doing to you only what they've been doing to me[a] from the day I brought them out of Egypt to this very minute, abandoning me and worshipping other gods.", "9": "So comply with their request, but give them a clear warning, telling them how the king will rule over them.\u201d[b]", "10": "Then Samuel explained everything the Lord had said to the people who were asking for a king.", "11": "\u201cThis is how the king will rule over you,\u201d Samuel said: \u201cHe will take your sons, and will use them for his chariots and his cavalry and as runners for his chariot.", "12": "He will use them as his commanders of troops of one thousand and troops of fifty, or to do his plowing and his harvesting, or to make his weapons or parts for his chariots.", "13": "He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, or bakers.", "14": "He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves and give them to his servants.", "15": "He will give one-tenth of your grain and your vineyards to his officials and servants.", "16": "He will take your male and female servants, along with the best of your cattle[c] and donkeys, and make them do his work.", "17": "He will take one-tenth of your flocks, and then you yourselves will become his slaves!", "18": "When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you chose for yourselves, but on that day the Lord won't answer you.\u201d", "19": "But the people refused to listen to Samuel and said, \u201cNo!

Our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles.\u201d", "21": "Samuel listened to everything the people said and repeated it directly to the Lord.", "22": "Then the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cComply with their request. Give them a king.\u201d Samuel then told the Israelite people, \u201cGo back, each of you, to your own hometown.\u201d"}

Each of the soldiers was deeply distressed about their sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God.", "7": "David said to the priest Abiathar, Ahimelech's son, \u201cBring the priestly vest[b] to me.\u201d So Abiathar brought it to David.", "8": "Then David asked the Lord, \u201cShould I go after this raiding party? Will I catch them?\u201d \u201cYes, go after them!\u201d God answered. \u201cYou will definitely catch them and will succeed in the rescue!\u201d", "9": "So David set off with six hundred men.

Where do you come from?\u201d \u201cI'm an Egyptian servant boy,\u201d he said, \u201cand the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I got sick three days ago.", "14": "We had raided the arid southern plain belonging to the Cherethites, the territory belonging to Judah, and the southern plain of Caleb. We also burned Ziklag down.\u201d", "15": "\u201cCan you guide me to this raiding party?\u201d David asked him. \u201cMake a pledge to me by God that you won't kill me or hand me over to my master,\u201d the boy said, \u201cand I will guide you to the raiding party.\u201d", "16": "So the boy led David to them, and he found them scattered all over the countryside, eating, drinking, and celebrating over the large amount of plunder they had taken from Philistine and Judean territory.", "17": "David attacked them from twilight until evening of the next day. He killed them all.[c] No one escaped except four hundred young men who got on camels and fled.", "18": "David rescued everything that the Amalekites had taken, including his own two wives.", "19": "Nothing was missing from the plunder or anything that they had taken, neither old nor young, son nor daughter.

I am the Philistine champion,[e] and you are Saul's servants. Isn't that right? Select one of your men, and let him come down against me.", "9": "If he is able to fight me and kill me, then we will become your slaves, but if I overcome him and kill him, then you will become our slaves and you will serve us.", "10": "I insult Israel's troops today!\u201d The Philistine continued, \u201cGive me an opponent, and we'll fight!\u201d", "11": "When Saul and all Israel heard what the Philistine said, they were distressed and terrified.[f]", "12": "Now David was Jesse's son, an Ephraimite from Bethlehem in Judah who had eight sons.

Who is that uncircumcised Philistine, anyway, that he can get away with insulting the army of the living God?\u201d", "27": "Then the troops repeated to him what they had been saying. \u201cSo that's what will be done for the man who kills him,\u201d they said.", "28": "When David's oldest brother Eliab heard him talking to the soldiers, he got very mad at David. \u201cWhy did you come down here?\u201d he said. \u201cWho is watching those few sheep for you in the wilderness? I know how arrogant you are and your devious plan: you came down just to see the battle!\u201d", "29": "\u201cWhat did I do wrong this time?\u201d David replied. \u201cIt was just a question!\u201d", "30": "So David turned to someone else and asked the same thing, and the people said the same thing in reply.", "31": "The things David had said were overheard and reported to Saul, who sent for him.", "32": "\u201cDon't let anyone[j] lose courage because of this Philistine!\u201d David told Saul. \u201cI, your servant, will go out and fight him!\u201d", "33": "\u201cYou can't go out and fight this Philistine,\u201d Saul answered David. \u201cYou are still a boy. But he's been a warrior since he was a boy!\u201d", "34": "\u201cYour servant has kept his father's sheep,\u201d David replied to Saul, \u201cand if ever a lion or a bear came and carried off one of the flock,", "35": "I would go after it, strike it, and rescue the animal from its mouth.

He put them in the pocket of his shepherd's bag and with sling in hand went out to the Philistine.", "41": "The Philistine got closer and closer to David, and his shield-bearer was in front of him.", "42": "When the Philistine looked David over, he sneered at David because he was just a boy; reddish brown and good-looking.", "43": "The Philistine asked David, \u201cAm I some sort of dog that you come at me with sticks?\u201d And he cursed David by his gods.", "44": "\u201cCome here,\u201d he said to David, \u201cand I'll feed your flesh to the wild birds and the wild animals!\u201d", "45": "But David told the Philistine, \u201cYou are coming against me with sword, spear, and scimitar, but I come against you in the name of the Lord of heavenly forces, the God of Israel's army, the one you've insulted.", "46": "Today the Lord will hand you over to me. I will strike you down and cut off your head! Today I will feed your dead body and the dead bodies of the entire Philistine camp[k] to the wild birds and the wild animals.

The Lord owns this war, and he will hand all of you over to us.\u201d", "48": "The Philistine got up and moved closer to attack David, and David ran quickly to the front line to face him.", "49": "David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone. He slung it, and it hit the Philistine on his forehead. The stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.", "50": "And that's how David triumphed over the Philistine with just a sling and a stone, striking the Philistine down and killing him\u2014and David didn't even have a sword!", "51": "Then David ran and stood over the Philistine. He grabbed the Philistine's sword, drew it from its sheath, and finished him off. Then David cut off the Philistine's head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.", "52": "The soldiers from Israel and Judah jumped up with a shout and chased the Philistines all the way to Gath[l] and the gates of Ekron. The dead Philistines were littered along the Shaarim road all the way to Gath and Ekron.", "53": "When the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.", "54": "David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.", "55": "Now when Saul saw David go out to meet the Philistine, he asked Abner the army general, \u201cAbner, whose son is that boy?\u201d \u201cAs surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don't know,\u201d Abner answered.", "56": "\u201cThen find out whose son that young man is,\u201d the king replied.", "57": "So when David came back from killing the Philistine, Abner sent for him and presented him to Saul. The Philistine's head was still in David's hand.", "58": "Saul said to him, \u201cWhose son are you, my boy?\u201d \u201cI'm the son of your servant Jesse from Bethlehem,\u201d David answered."}

{"1": "Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on Mount Samaria, who cheat the weak, who crush the needy, who say to their husbands, \u201cBring drinks, so we can get drunk!\u201d", "2": "The Lord God has solemnly promised by his holiness: The days are surely coming upon you, when they will take you away with hooks, even the last one of you with fishhooks.", "3": "You will go out through the broken wall, each one after another; and you will be flung out into Harmon, says the Lord.", "4": "Come to Bethel\u2014and commit a crime; multiply crimes at Gilgal. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tenth-part gifts every three days.", "5": "Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice of leavened bread, and publicize your gifts to the Lord; for so you love to do, people of Israel! says the Lord God.", "6": "I have sent a famine in all your cities, and not provided enough bread in all your places, yet you didn't return to me, says the Lord.", "7": "I also withheld rain from you when there were still three months to the harvest. I allowed rain to fall on one city, no rain to fall on another city. One field was rained on, and the field dried up where it didn't rain.", "8": "So two or three thirsty towns went to one city to drink water, and weren't satisfied; yet you didn't return to me, says the Lord.", "9": "I struck you with disease and mildew. I destroyed your gardens and your vineyards. The locust devoured your fig trees and your olive trees; yet you didn't return to me, says the Lord.", "10": "I sent a plague against you like the one in Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword. I carried away your horses. I made the stink of your camp go up into your nostrils; yet you didn't return to me, says the Lord.", "11": "I destroyed some of you, as when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning coal plucked out of the fire; yet you didn't return to me, says the Lord.", "12": "Truly, Israel, I will act in this way toward you; therefore, I will do this to you. Prepare to meet your God, Israel!", "13": "The one who forms the mountains, creates the wind, makes known his thoughts to humankind, makes the morning darkness, and moves over the heights of the earth\u2014 the Lord, the God of heavenly forces is his name!"}

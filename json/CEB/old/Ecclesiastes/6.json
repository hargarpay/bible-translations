{"1": "I saw a tragedy under the sun, and it weighs heavily upon humanity.", "2": "God may give some people plenty of wealth, riches, and glory so that they lack nothing they desire. But God doesn't enable them to enjoy it; instead, a stranger enjoys it. This is pointless and a sickening tragedy.", "3": "Some people may have one hundred children and live a long life. But no matter how long they live, if they aren't content with life's good things, I say that even a stillborn child with no grave is better off than they are.[a]", "4": "Because that child arrives pointlessly, then passes away in darkness. Darkness covers its name.", "5": "It hasn't seen the sun or experienced anything. But it has more peace than those", "6": "who live a thousand years twice over but don't enjoy life's good things. Isn't everyone heading to the same destination?", "7": "All the hard work of humans is for the mouth, but the appetite is never full.", "8": "What advantage do the wise have over the foolish? Or what do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before the living?", "9": "It's better to enjoy what's at hand than to have an insatiable appetite. This too is pointless, just wind chasing.", "10": "Whatever happens has already been designated, and human beings are fully known. They can't contend with the one who is stronger than they are.", "11": "Because the more words increase, the more everything is pointless. What do people gain by it?", "12": "Because who knows what's good for human beings during life, during their brief pointless life, which will pass away like a shadow? Who can say what the future holds for people under the sun?"}

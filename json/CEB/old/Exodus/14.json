{"1": "Then the Lord said to Moses:", "2": "Tell the Israelites to turn back and set up camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea in front of Baal-zephon. You should set up camp in front of it by the sea.", "3": "Pharaoh will think to himself, The Israelites are lost and confused in the land. The desert has trapped them.", "4": "I'll make Pharaoh stubborn, and he'll chase them. I'll gain honor at the expense of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. And they did exactly that.", "5": "When Egypt's king was told that the people had run away, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people. They said, \u201cWhat have we done, letting Israel go free from their slavery to us?\u201d", "6": "So he sent for his chariot and took his army with him.", "7": "He took six hundred elite chariots and all of Egypt's other chariots with captains on all of them.", "8": "The Lord made Pharaoh, Egypt's king, stubborn, and he chased the Israelites, who were leaving confidently.", "9": "The Egyptians, including all of Pharaoh's horse-drawn chariots, his cavalry, and his army, chased them and caught up with them as they were camped by the sea, by Pi-hahiroth in front of Baal-zephon.", "10": "As Pharaoh drew closer, the Israelites looked back and saw the Egyptians marching toward them. The Israelites were terrified and cried out to the Lord.", "11": "They said to Moses, \u201cWeren't there enough graves in Egypt that you took us away to die in the desert? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt like this?", "12": "Didn't we tell you the same thing in Egypt? 'Leave us alone! Let us work for the Egyptians!' It would have been better for us to work for the Egyptians than to die in the desert.\u201d", "13": "But Moses said to the people, \u201cDon't be afraid. Stand your ground, and watch the Lord rescue you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never ever see again.", "14": "The Lord will fight for you. You just keep still.\u201d", "15": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cWhy do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites to get moving.", "16": "As for you, lift your shepherd's rod, stretch out your hand over the sea, and split it in two so that the Israelites can go into the sea on dry ground.", "17": "But me, I'll make the Egyptians stubborn so that they will go in after them, and I'll gain honor at the expense of Pharaoh, all his army, his chariots, and his cavalry.", "18": "The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I gain honor at the expense of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his cavalry.\u201d", "19": "God's messenger, who had been in front of Israel's camp, moved and went behind them. The column of cloud moved from the front and took its place behind them.", "20": "It stood between Egypt's camp and Israel's camp. The cloud remained there, and when darkness fell it lit up the night. They didn't come near each other all night.", "21": "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The Lord pushed the sea back by a strong east wind all night, turning the sea into dry land. The waters were split into two.", "22": "The Israelites walked into the sea on dry ground. The waters formed a wall for them on their right hand and on their left.", "23": "The Egyptians chased them and went into the sea after them, all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and cavalry.", "24": "As morning approached, the Lord looked down on the Egyptian camp from the column of lightning and cloud and threw the Egyptian camp into a panic.", "25": "The Lord jammed their chariot wheels so that they wouldn't turn easily. The Egyptians said, \u201cLet's get away from the Israelites, because the Lord is fighting for them against Egypt!\u201d", "26": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cStretch out your hand over the sea so that the water comes back and covers the Egyptians, their chariots, and their cavalry.\u201d", "27": "So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. At daybreak, the sea returned to its normal depth. The Egyptians were driving toward it, and the Lord tossed the Egyptians into the sea.", "28": "The waters returned and covered the chariots and the cavalry, Pharaoh's entire army that had followed them into the sea. Not one of them remained.", "29": "The Israelites, however, walked on dry ground through the sea. The waters formed a wall for them on their right hand and on their left.", "30": "The Lord rescued Israel from the Egyptians that day. Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.", "31": "Israel saw the amazing power of the Lord against the Egyptians. The people were in awe of the Lord, and they believed in the Lord and in his servant Moses."}

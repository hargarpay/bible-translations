{"1": "Afterward, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, \u201cThis is what the Lord, Israel's God, says: 'Let my people go so that they can hold a festival for me in the desert.'\u201d", "2": "But Pharaoh said, \u201cWho is this Lord whom I'm supposed to obey by letting Israel go? I don't know this Lord, and I certainly won't let Israel go.\u201d", "3": "Then they said, \u201cThe Hebrews' God has appeared to us. Let us go on a three-day journey into the desert so we can offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. Otherwise, the Lord will give us a deadly disease or violence.\u201d", "4": "The king of Egypt said to them, \u201cMoses and Aaron, why are you making the people slack off from their work? Do the hard work yourselves!\u201d", "5": "Pharaoh continued, \u201cThe land's people are now numerous. Yet you want them to stop their hard work?\u201d", "6": "On the very same day Pharaoh commanded the people's slave masters and supervisors,", "7": "\u201cDon't supply the people with the straw they need to make bricks like you did before. Let them go out and gather the straw for themselves.", "8": "But still make sure that they produce the same number of bricks as they made before. Don't reduce the number! They are weak and lazy, and that's why they cry, 'Let's go and offer sacrifices to our God.'", "9": "Make the men's work so hard that it's all they can do, and they can't focus on these empty lies.\u201d", "10": "So the people's slave masters and supervisors came out and spoke to the people, \u201cThis is what Pharaoh says, 'I'm not giving you straw anymore.", "11": "Go and get the straw on your own, wherever you can find it. But your work won't be reduced at all.'\u201d", "12": "So the people spread out all through the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.", "13": "The slave masters drove them hard and said, \u201cMake sure you make the same daily quota as when you had the straw.\u201d", "14": "The Israelite supervisors, whom Pharaoh's slave masters had set over them, were also beaten and asked, \u201cWhy didn't you produce the same number of bricks yesterday and today as you did before?\u201d", "15": "Then the Israelite supervisors came and pleaded to Pharaoh, \u201cWhy do you treat your servants like this?", "16": "No straw is supplied to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' Look at how your servants are being beaten! Your own people are to blame!\u201d", "17": "Pharaoh replied, \u201cYou are lazy bums, nothing but lazy bums. That's why you say, 'Let us go and offer sacrifices to the Lord.'", "18": "Go and get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you still need to make the same number of bricks.\u201d", "19": "The Israelite supervisors saw how impossible their situation was when they were commanded, \u201cDon't reduce your daily quota of bricks.\u201d", "20": "When they left Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them.", "21": "The supervisors said to them, \u201cLet the Lord see and judge what you've done! You've made us stink in the opinion of Pharaoh and his servants. You've given them a reason to kill us.\u201d", "22": "Then Moses turned to the Lord and said, \u201cMy Lord, why have you abused this people? Why did you send me for this?", "23": "Ever since I first came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has abused this people. And you've done absolutely nothing to rescue your people.\u201d"}

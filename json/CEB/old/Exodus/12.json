You should divide the lamb in proportion to the number of people who will be eating it.", "5": "Your lamb should be a flawless year-old male. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.", "6": "You should keep close watch over it until the fourteenth day of this month. At twilight on that day, the whole assembled Israelite community should slaughter their lambs.", "7": "They should take some of the blood and smear it on the two doorposts and on the beam over the door of the houses in which they are eating.", "8": "That same night they should eat the meat roasted over the fire. They should eat it along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.", "9": "Don't eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over fire with its head, legs, and internal organs.", "10": "Don't let any of it remain until morning, and burn any of it left over in the morning.", "11": "This is how you should eat it. You should be dressed, with your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand. You should eat the meal in a hurry.

And bring a blessing on me as well!\u201d", "33": "The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the land because they thought, We'll all be dead.", "34": "So the people picked up their bread dough before the yeast made it rise, with their bread pans wrapped in their robes on their shoulders.", "35": "The Israelites did as Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for their silver and gold jewelry as well as their clothing.", "36": "The Lord made sure that the Egyptians were kind to the people so that they let them have whatever they asked for.

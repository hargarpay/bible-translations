Maybe you will be hidden on the day of the Lord's anger.", "4": "Gaza will certainly be abandoned; and Ashkelon destroyed. Ashdod will be driven out at noon; Ekron will be uprooted.", "5": "Doom, inhabitants of the seacoast, nation of Cretans. The Lord's word is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. I will exterminate you, leaving no inhabitant.", "6": "The seacoast will become pastureland, with wells for shepherds and pens for the flocks.", "7": "The coast will belong to the survivors from the house of Judah; they will pasture beside the sea;[b] in the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening. The Lord their God will visit them and restore their possessions.", "8": "I have heard the taunting of Moab and the defamation of the Ammonites; they taunted my people and enlarged their borders.", "9": "Therefore, as I live\u2014 says the Lord of heavenly forces, the God of Israel\u2014 Moab will become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah: a plot of weeds, salt pits, and devastation forever.

Moreover, the owl and the porcupine will spend the night on its columns. A bird's call will resound from the window.

How she has become a desolation, a resting place for the wild animals. All those who pass through her hiss and shake their fist."}

{"1": "Now the Lord was going to take Elijah up to heaven in a windstorm, and Elijah and Elisha were leaving Gilgal.", "2": "Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here, because the Lord has sent me to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So they went down to Bethel.", "3": "The group of prophets from Bethel came out to Elisha. These prophets said to Elisha, \u201cDo you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cYes, I know. Don't talk about it!\u201d", "4": "Elijah said, \u201cElisha, stay here, because the Lord has sent me to Jericho.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So they went to Jericho.", "5": "The group of prophets from Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I know. Don't talk about it!\u201d", "6": "Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here, because the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So both of them went on together.", "7": "Fifty members from the group of prophets also went along, but they stood at a distance. Both Elijah and Elisha stood beside the Jordan River.", "8": "Elijah then took his coat, rolled it up, and hit the water. Then the water was divided in two! Both of them crossed over on dry ground.", "9": "When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you before I'm taken away from you?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cLet me have twice your spirit.\u201d", "10": "Elijah said, \u201cYou've made a difficult request. If you can see me when I'm taken from you, then it will be yours. If you don't see me, it won't happen.\u201d", "11": "They were walking along, talking, when suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses appeared and separated the two of them. Then Elijah went to heaven in a windstorm.", "12": "Elisha was watching, and he cried out, \u201cOh, my father, my father! Israel's chariots and its riders!\u201d When he could no longer see him, Elisha took hold of his clothes and ripped them in two.", "13": "Then Elisha picked up the coat that had fallen from Elijah. He went back and stood beside the banks of the Jordan River.", "14": "He took the coat that had fallen from Elijah and hit the water. He said, \u201cWhere is the Lord, Elijah's God?\u201d And when he hit the water, it divided in two! Then Elisha crossed over.", "15": "The group of prophets from Jericho saw him from a distance. They said, \u201cElijah's spirit has settled on Elisha!\u201d So they came out to meet him, bowing down before him.", "16": "\u201cLook,\u201d they told him, \u201cthere are fifty strong men among us, your servants. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Lord's spirit has picked him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cDon't send them.\u201d", "17": "They insisted until he became embarrassed and said, \u201cOkay, send them.\u201d So they sent fifty men who searched for three days. But they couldn't find Elijah.", "18": "When these men returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, \u201cDidn't I tell you not to go?\u201d", "19": "The citizens said to Elisha, \u201cAs you can see, sir, this city is in a good location, but the water is bad, and the land causes miscarriages.\u201d", "20": "He said, \u201cBring me a new bowl, and put some salt in it.\u201d They did so.", "21": "Elisha then went out and threw salt into the spring. He said, \u201cThis is what the Lord has said: I have purified this water. It will no longer cause death and miscarriage.\u201d", "22": "The water has stayed pure right up to this very day, in agreement with the word that Elisha spoke.", "23": "Elisha went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up the road, some young people came out of the city. They mocked him: \u201cGet going, Baldy! Get going, Baldy!\u201d", "24": "Turning around, Elisha looked at them and cursed them in the Lord's name. Then two bears came out of the woods and mangled forty-two of the youths.", "25": "From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria."}

{"1": "Elisha said, \u201cHear the Lord's word! This is what the Lord says: At this time tomorrow a seah[a] of wheat flour will sell for a shekel at Samaria's gate, and two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel.\u201d", "2": "Then the officer, the one the king leaned on for support, spoke to the man of God: \u201cCome on! Even if the Lord should make windows in the sky, how could that happen?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cYou will see it with your own eyes, but you won't eat from it.\u201d", "3": "Now there were four men with skin disease[b] at the entrance to the city. They said to each other, \u201cWhat are we doing sitting here until we die?", "4": "If we decide, 'Let's go into the city,' the famine is there, and we'll die in the city. But if we stay here, we'll die just the same. So let's go and surrender to the Aramean camp. If they let us live, we'll live. If they kill us, we'll die.\u201d", "5": "So they set out in the evening to the Aramean camp, and they came to the edge of the camp. But there was no one there because", "6": "the Lord had made the Aramean camp hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a strong army. They had said to each other, \u201cListen! Israel's king has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to come against us!\u201d", "7": "So they had got up and fled in the evening, leaving their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp exactly as it was and ran for their lives.", "8": "So these men with skin disease came to the edge of the camp. They entered a tent where they ate and drank. They carried off some silver, gold, and garments, and they hid them. Then they returned and went into another tent. They took more things from there, went away, and hid them.", "9": "But then they said to each other, \u201cWhat we're doing isn't right. Today is a day of good news, but we're keeping quiet about it. If we wait until dawn, something bad will happen to us. Come on! Let's go and tell the palace.\u201d", "10": "So they went and called out to the gatekeepers, telling them, \u201cWe went to the Aramean camp, and listen to this: No one was there, not even the sound of anyone! The only things there were tied-up horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.\u201d", "11": "The gatekeepers shouted out the news, and it was reported within the palace.", "12": "The king got up in the night. He said to his servants, \u201cLet me tell you what the Arameans are doing to us. They know we are starving, so they've left the camp to hide in the fields. They are thinking, The Israelites will come out from the city, and then we'll capture them alive and invade the city.\u201d", "13": "But one of his servants answered, \u201cPlease let some men take five of the horses that are left, and let's send them out to see what happens. They are in the same situation as the large number of Israelites who are left here; they are no better off than the large number of Israelites who've already perished.\u201d[c]", "14": "So they chose two chariots with their horses. The king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, \u201cGo and see!\u201d", "15": "So they went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River. The road was filled the whole way with garments and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their rush. The messengers returned and reported this to the king.", "16": "Then the people went out and looted the Aramean camp. And so it happened that a seah of wheat flour did sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, in agreement with the Lord's word.", "17": "But the king had put the officer whom he leaned on for support in charge of the city gate. The people trampled the officer at the gate, and he died. This was just what the man of God said when the king had come down to him.", "18": "Because when the man of God said to the king, \u201cAt this time tomorrow two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel at Samaria's gate, and one seah of wheat flour will sell for a shekel,\u201d", "19": "the officer had answered the man of God, \u201cCome on! Even if the Lord should make windows in the sky, how could that happen?\u201d Then Elisha had said, \u201cYou will see it with your own eyes, but you won't eat from it.\u201d", "20": "That's exactly what happened to him. The people trampled him at the city gate, and he died."}

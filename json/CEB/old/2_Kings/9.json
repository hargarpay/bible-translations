{"1": "The prophet Elisha called to a member of the group of prophets, \u201cGet ready, take this jug of oil with you, and go to Ramoth-gilead.", "2": "When you arrive there, look for Jehu, Jehoshaphat's son and Nimshi's grandson. Go to him, then pull him away from his associates, taking him to a private room.", "3": "Take the jug of oil and pour it on his head. Then say, 'This is what the Lord has said: I anoint you king of Israel.' Then open the door, and run out of there without stopping.\u201d", "4": "So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead.", "5": "He came in, and the military commanders were sitting right there. He said, \u201cCommander, I have a word for you.\u201d \u201cFor which one of us?\u201d Jehu asked. The young prophet said, \u201cFor you, Commander.\u201d", "6": "So Jehu got up and went inside. The prophet then poured oil on his head and said to him, \u201cThis is what the Lord, Israel's God, says: I anoint you king over the Lord's people, over Israel.", "7": "You will strike down your master Ahab's family. In this way I will take revenge for the violence done by Jezebel to my servants the prophets and to all the Lord's servants.", "8": "Ahab's whole family will die. I will eliminate from Ahab everyone who urinates on a wall, whether slave or free, in Israel.", "9": "I will make Ahab's dynasty like the dynasty of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, and like the dynasty of Baasha, Ahijah's son.", "10": "And as for Jezebel: The dogs will devour her in the area of Jezreel. No one will bury her.\u201d Then the young prophet opened the door and ran.", "11": "Jehu went out to his master's officers. They said to him, \u201cIs everything okay? Why did this fanatic come to you?\u201d Jehu said to them, \u201cYou know the man and the nonsense he talks.\u201d", "12": "\u201cThat's a lie!\u201d they said. \u201cCome on, tell us!\u201d Jehu replied, \u201cThis is what he said to me: 'This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king of Israel.'\u201d", "13": "Then each man quickly took his cloak and put it beneath Jehu on the paved steps.[a] They blew a trumpet and said, \u201cJehu has become king!\u201d", "14": "Then Jehu, Jehoshaphat's son and Nimshi's grandson, plotted against Joram. Now Joram along with all of Israel had been guarding Ramoth-gilead against Aram's King Hazael,", "15": "but King Joram[b] had gone back to Jezreel to recover from wounds that the Arameans had given him when he fought Hazael. So Jehu said, \u201cIf this is the way you feel, then don't let anyone escape from the city to talk about it in Jezreel.\u201d", "16": "Then Jehu got on a chariot and drove to Jezreel because Joram was resting there. Judah's King Ahaziah had also come to visit Joram.", "17": "The guard standing on the tower at Jezreel saw a crowd of people coming with Jehu. He said, \u201cI see a crowd of people.\u201d Joram said, \u201cTake a chariot driver. Send him out to meet them to ask, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d", "18": "So the driver went to meet him and said, \u201cThe king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d Jehu replied, \u201cWhat do you care about peace? Come around and follow me.\u201d Meanwhile, the tower guard reported, \u201cThe messenger met them, but he isn't returning.\u201d", "19": "The king sent a second driver. He came to them and said, \u201cThe king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'\u201d Jehu said, \u201cWhat do you care about peace? Come around and follow me.\u201d", "20": "The tower guard reported, \u201cThe messenger met them, but he isn't returning. And the style of chariot driving is like Jehu, Nimshi's son. Jehu drives like a madman.\u201d", "21": "Joram said, \u201cHitch up the chariot!\u201d So they hitched up his chariot. Then Israel's King Joram and Judah's King Ahaziah\u2014each in his own chariot\u2014went out to meet Jehu. They happened to meet him at the plot of ground that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.", "22": "When Joram saw Jehu, he said, \u201cDo you come in peace, Jehu?\u201d He said, \u201cHow can there be peace as long as the immoralities of your mother Jezebel and her many acts of sorcery continue?\u201d", "23": "Then Joram turned his chariot around and fled. He shouted to Ahaziah, \u201cIt's a trap, Ahaziah!\u201d", "24": "Jehu took his bow and shot Joram in the back. The arrow went through his heart, and he fell down in his chariot.", "25": "Jehu said to Bidkar his chariot officer, \u201cPick him up, and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were driving chariot teams behind his father Ahab when the Lord spoke this prophecy about him:", "26": "Yesterday I saw Naboth's blood and his sons' blood, declares the Lord. I swear that I will pay you back on this very plot of ground, declares the Lord. Now pick him up, and throw him on that plot of ground, in agreement with the Lord's word.\u201d", "27": "Judah's King Ahaziah saw this and fled on the road to Beth-haggan. Jehu chased after him. \u201cDo the same to him!\u201d he commanded. They shot him[c] in his chariot on the way up to Gur, near Ibleam. Ahaziah fled to Megiddo and died there.", "28": "His servants carried him back in a chariot to Jerusalem. He was buried in his tomb with his ancestors in David's City.", "29": "Ahaziah had become Judah's king in the eleventh year of Ahab's son Joram.", "30": "Jehu then went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard of it, she put on her eye shadow and arranged her hair. She looked down out of the window.", "31": "When Jehu came through the gate, she said, \u201cDo you come in peace, Zimri, you master murderer?\u201d", "32": "Jehu looked up to the window and said, \u201cWho's on my side? Anyone?\u201d Two or three high officials looked down at him.", "33": "Then he said, \u201cThrow her out!\u201d So they threw her out of the window. Some of her blood splattered against the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her.", "34": "Jehu then went in to eat and drink. He said, \u201cDeal with this cursed woman and bury her. She was, after all, a king's daughter.\u201d", "35": "They went to bury her, but they couldn't find her body. Only her skull was left, along with her hands and feet.", "36": "They went back and reported this to Jehu. He said, \u201cThis is the Lord's word spoken through his servant Elijah from Tishbe: Dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh in the area of Jezreel.", "37": "Jezebel's corpse will be like dung spread out in a field in that plot of land in Jezreel, so no one will be able to say, This was Jezebel.\u201d"}

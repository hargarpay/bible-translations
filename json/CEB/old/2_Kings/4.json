{"1": "Now there was a woman who had been married to a member of a group of prophets. She appealed to Elisha, saying, \u201cMy husband, your servant, is dead. You know how he feared the Lord. But now someone he owed money to has come to take my two children away as slaves.\u201d", "2": "Elisha said to her, \u201cWhat can I do for you? Tell me what you still have left in the house.\u201d She said, \u201cYour servant has nothing at all in the house except a small jar of oil.\u201d", "3": "He said, \u201cGo out and borrow containers from all your neighbors. Get as many empty containers as possible.", "4": "Then go in and close the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all those containers. Set each one aside when it's full.\u201d", "5": "She left Elisha and closed the door behind her and her sons. They brought her containers as she kept on pouring.", "6": "When she had filled the containers, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another container.\u201d He said to her, \u201cThere aren't any more.\u201d Then the oil stopped flowing,", "7": "and she reported this to the man of God. He said, \u201cGo! Sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what remains.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha went to Shunem. A rich woman lived there. She urged him to eat something, so whenever he passed by, he would stop in to eat some food.", "9": "She said to her husband, \u201cLook, I know that he is a holy man of God and he passes by regularly.", "10": "Let's make a small room on the roof. We'll set up a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him there. Then when he comes to us, he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "So one day Elisha came there, headed to the room on the roof, and lay down.", "12": "He said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cCall this Shunammite woman.\u201d Gehazi called her, and she stood before him.", "13": "Elisha then said to Gehazi, \u201cSay to her, 'Look, you've gone to all this trouble for us. What can I do for you? Is there anything I can say on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?'\u201d She said, \u201cI'm content to live at home with my own people.\u201d", "14": "Elisha asked, \u201cSo what can be done for her?\u201d Gehazi said, \u201cWell, she doesn't have a son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "Elisha said, \u201cCall her.\u201d So Gehazi called her, and she stood at the door.", "16": "Elisha said, \u201cAbout this time next year, you will be holding a son in your arms.\u201d But she said, \u201cNo, man of God, sir; don't lie to your servant.\u201d", "17": "But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at about the same time the next year. This was what Elisha had promised her.", "18": "The child grew up. One day he ran to his father, who was with the harvest workers.", "19": "He said to his father, \u201cOh, my head! My head!\u201d The father said to a young man, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d", "20": "So he picked up the boy and brought him to his mother. The boy sat on her lap until noon. Then he died.", "21": "She went up and laid him down on the bed for the man of God. Then she went out and closed the door.", "22": "She called her husband and said, \u201cSend me one of the young men and one of the donkeys so that I can hurry to the man of God and come back.\u201d", "23": "Her husband said, \u201cWhy are you going to him today? It's not a new moon or sabbath.\u201d She said, \u201cDon't worry about it.\u201d", "24": "She saddled the donkey, then said to her young servant, \u201cDrive the donkey hard. Don't let me slow down unless I tell you.\u201d", "25": "So she went off and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. As soon as the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant, \u201cLook, it's the Shunammite woman!", "26": "Run out to meet her and ask her, 'Are things okay with you, your husband, and your child?'\u201d She said, \u201cThings are okay.\u201d", "27": "When she got to the man of God at the mountain, she grabbed his feet. Gehazi came up to push her away, but the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone! She is distraught, but the Lord has hidden the reason from me and hasn't told me why.\u201d", "28": "She said, \u201cDid I ask you for a son, sir? Didn't I say, 'Don't raise my hopes'?\u201d", "29": "Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cGet ready, take my staff, and go! If you encounter anyone, don't stop to greet them. If anyone greets you, don't reply. Put my staff on the boy's face.\u201d", "30": "But the boy's mother said, \u201cI swear by your life and by the Lord's life, I won't leave you!\u201d So Elisha got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi went on ahead of them. He set the staff on the young boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So he went back to meet Elisha and told him, \u201cThe boy didn't wake up.\u201d", "32": "Elisha came into the house and saw the boy lying dead on his bed.", "33": "He went in and closed the door behind the two of them. Then he prayed to the Lord.", "34": "He got up on the bed and lay down on top of the child, putting his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on the boy's eyes, his hands on the boy's hands. And as he bent over him, the child's skin grew warm.", "35": "Then Elisha got down and paced back and forth in the house. Once again he got up on the bed and bent over the boy, at which point the boy sneezed[a] seven times and opened his eyes.", "36": "Elisha called for Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite woman.\u201d Gehazi called her, and she came to Elisha. He told her, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d", "37": "She came and fell at his feet, facedown on the ground. Then she picked up her son and left.", "38": "When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. A group of prophets was sitting before him. He said to his servant, \u201cPut on the big pot and cook some stew for the prophets.\u201d", "39": "So one of them went out to the field to gather plants; he found a wild vine and gathered wild gourds from it, filling his garment. He came and cut them up into the pot of stew, but no one knew what they were.", "40": "The stew was served to the men, but as they started to eat it, they cried out and said, \u201cThere is death in that pot, man of God!\u201d They couldn't eat it.", "41": "Elisha said, \u201cGet some flour.\u201d He threw it into the pot and said, \u201cServe the people so they can eat.\u201d At that point, there was nothing bad left in the pot.", "42": "A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God some bread from the early produce\u2014twenty loaves of barley bread and fresh grain from his bag.[b] Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people so they can eat.\u201d", "43": "His servant said, \u201cHow can I feed one hundred men with this?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people so they can eat! This is what the Lord says: 'Eat and there will be leftovers.'\u201d", "44": "So the servant gave the food to them. They ate and had leftovers, in agreement with the Lord's word."}

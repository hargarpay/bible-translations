His mother's name was Abi;[a] she was Zechariah's daughter.", "3": "Hezekiah did what was right in the Lord's eyes, just as his ancestor David had done.", "4": "He removed the shrines. He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred pole.[b] He crushed the bronze snake that Moses made, because up to that point the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (The snake was named Nehushtan.)", "5": "Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, Israel's God. There was no one like him among all of Judah's kings\u2014not before him and not after him.", "6": "He clung to the Lord and never deviated from him. He kept the commandments that the Lord had commanded Moses.", "7": "The Lord was with Hezekiah; he succeeded at everything he tried. He rebelled against Assyria's king and wouldn't serve him.", "8": "He struck down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territories, from watchtower to fortified city.", "9": "Assyria's King Shalmaneser marched against Samaria and attacked it in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Israel's King Hoshea, Elah's son.", "10": "After three years the Assyrians captured the city. Samaria was captured in Hezekiah's sixth year, which was Hoshea's ninth year.", "11": "Assyria's king sent Israel into exile to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.", "12": "All this happened because they wouldn't listen to the Lord their God. They broke his covenant\u2014all that the Lord's servant Moses had commanded them.

Who are you trusting in that you now rebel against me?", "21": "It appears that you are trusting in a staff\u2014Egypt\u2014that's nothing but a broken reed! It will stab the hand of anyone who leans on it! That's all that Pharaoh, Egypt's king, is to anyone who trusts in him.", "22": "Now suppose you say to me, 'We trust in the Lord our God.' Isn't he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah removed, telling Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?", "23": "\u201cSo now make a wager with my master, Assyria's king. I'll give you two thousand horses if you can supply the riders!", "24": "How will you drive back even the least important official among my master's servants when you are relying on Egypt for chariots and riders?", "25": "What's more, do you think I've marched against this place to destroy it without the Lord's support? It was the Lord who told me, March against this land and destroy it!\u201d", "26": "Hilkiah's son Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, \u201cPlease speak to your servants in Aramaic because we understand it. Don't speak with us in Hebrew, because the people on the wall will hear it.\u201d", "27": "The field commander said to them, \u201cDid my master send me to speak these words just to you and your master and not also to the men on the wall? They are the ones who will have to eat their dung and drink their urine along with you.\u201d", "28": "Then the field commander stood up and shouted in Hebrew at the top of his voice, saying, \u201cListen to the message of the great king, Assyria's king.", "29": "This is what the king says: Don't let Hezekiah lie to you. He won't be able to rescue you from the power of Assyria's king.", "30": "Don't let Hezekiah persuade you to trust the Lord by saying, 'The Lord will certainly rescue us.

Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my power?", "35": "Which one of any of the gods of those lands has rescued their country from my power? Why should the Lord rescue Jerusalem from my power?\u201d", "36": "But the people kept quiet and didn't answer him with a single word, because King Hezekiah's command was, \u201cDon't answer him!\u201d", "37": "Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Asaph's son Joah the recorder, came to Hezekiah with ripped clothes.

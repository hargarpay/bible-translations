As soon as he saw them, he ran from his tent entrance to greet them and bowed deeply.", "3": "He said, \u201cSirs, if you would be so kind, don't just pass by your servant.", "4": "Let a little water be brought so you may wash your feet and refresh yourselves under the tree.", "5": "Let me offer you a little bread so you will feel stronger, and after that you may leave your servant and go on your way\u2014since you have visited your servant.\u201d They responded, \u201cFine. Do just as you have said.\u201d", "6": "So Abraham hurried to Sarah at his tent and said, \u201cHurry! Knead three seahs[a] of the finest flour and make some baked goods!\u201d", "7": "Abraham ran to the cattle, took a healthy young calf, and gave it to a young servant, who prepared it quickly.", "8": "Then Abraham took butter, milk, and the calf that had been prepared, put the food in front of them, and stood under the tree near them as they ate.", "9": "They said to him, \u201cWhere's your wife Sarah?\u201d And he said, \u201cRight here in the tent.\u201d", "10": "Then one of the men said, \u201cI will definitely return to you about this time next year. Then your wife Sarah will have a son!\u201d Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.", "11": "Now Abraham and Sarah were both very old.

Will you really sweep it away and not save the place for the sake of the fifty innocent people in it?", "25": "It's not like you to do this, killing the innocent with the guilty as if there were no difference. It's not like you! Will the judge of all the earth not act justly?\u201d", "26": "The Lord said, \u201cIf I find fifty innocent people in the city of Sodom, I will save it because of them.\u201d", "27": "Abraham responded, \u201cSince I've already decided to speak with my Lord, even though I'm just soil and ash,", "28": "what if there are five fewer innocent people than fifty?

What if thirty are there?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cI won't do it if I find thirty there.\u201d", "31": "Abraham said, \u201cSince I've already decided to speak with my Lord, what if twenty are there?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cI won't do it, for the sake of twenty.\u201d", "32": "Abraham said, \u201cDon't be angry with me, my Lord, but let me speak just once more. What if there are ten?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cI will not destroy it because of those ten.\u201d", "33": "When the Lord finished speaking with Abraham, he left; but Abraham stayed there in that place."}

Why are you standing outside? I've prepared the house and a place for the camels.\u201d", "32": "So the man entered the house. Then Laban unbridled the camels, provided straw and feed for them and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him,", "33": "and set out a meal for him. But the man said, \u201cI won't eat until I've said something.\u201d Laban replied, \u201cSay it.\u201d", "34": "The man said, \u201cI am Abraham's servant.", "35": "The Lord has richly blessed my master, has made him a great man, and has given him flocks, cattle, silver, gold, men servants, women servants, camels, and donkeys.", "36": "My master's wife Sarah gave birth to a son for my master in her old age, and he's given him everything he owns.", "37": "My master made me give him my word: 'Don't choose a wife for my son from the Canaanite women, in whose land I'm living.", "38": "No, instead, go to my father's household and to my relatives and choose a wife for my son.'", "39": "I said to my master, 'What if the woman won't come back with me?'", "40": "He said to me, 'The Lord, whom I've traveled with everywhere, will send his messenger with you and make your trip successful; and you will choose a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father's household.", "41": "If you go to my relatives, you will be free from your obligation to me.

So I drank and she also gave water to the camels.", "47": "Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son whom Milcah bore him.' I put a ring in her nose and bracelets on her arms.", "48": "I bowed and worshipped the Lord and blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who led me in the right direction to choose the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son.", "49": "Now if you're loyal and faithful to my master, tell me.

To her brother and to her mother he gave the finest gifts.", "54": "He and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, the servant said, \u201cSee me off to my master.\u201d", "55": "Her brother and mother said, \u201cLet the young woman stay with us not more than ten days, and after that she may go.\u201d", "56": "But he said to them, \u201cDon't delay me. The Lord has made my trip successful. See me off so that I can go to my master.\u201d", "57": "They said, \u201cSummon the young woman, and let's ask her opinion.\u201d", "58": "They called Rebekah and said to her, \u201cWill you go with this man?\u201d She said, \u201cI will go.\u201d", "59": "So they sent off their sister Rebekah, her nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men.", "60": "And they blessed Rebekah, saying to her, \u201cMay you, our sister, become thousands of ten thousand; may your children possess their enemies' cities.\u201d", "61": "Rebekah and her young women got up, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.", "62": "Now Isaac had come from the region of[b] Beer-lahai-roi and had settled in the arid southern plain.", "63": "One evening, Isaac went out to inspect the pasture,[c] and while staring he saw camels approaching.", "64": "Rebekah stared at Isaac. She got down from the camel", "65": "and said to the servant, \u201cWho is this man walking through the pasture to meet us?\u201d The servant said, \u201cHe's my master.\u201d So she took her headscarf and covered herself.", "66": "The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.", "67": "Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent.

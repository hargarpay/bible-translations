But my father's God has been with me.", "6": "You know that I've worked for your father as hard as I could.", "7": "But your father cheated me and changed my payment ten times. Yet God didn't let him harm me.", "8": "If he said, 'The speckled ones will be your payment,' the whole flock gave birth to speckled young. And if he said, 'The striped ones will be your payment,' the whole flock gave birth to striped young.", "9": "God took away your father's livestock and gave them to me.", "10": "When the flocks were mating, I looked up and saw in a dream that the male goats that mounted the flock were striped, speckled, and spotted.", "11": "In the dream, God's messenger said to me, 'Jacob!' and I said, 'I'm here.'", "12": "He said, 'Look up and watch all the striped, speckled, and spotted male goats mounting the flock. I've seen everything that Laban is doing to you.", "13": "I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a sacred pillar and where you made a solemn promise to me. Now, get up and leave this country and go back to the land of your relatives.'\u201d", "14": "Rachel and Leah answered him, \u201cIs there any share or inheritance left for us in our father's household?", "15": "Doesn't he think of us as foreigners since he sold us and has even used up the payment he received for us?", "16": "All of the wealth God took from our father belongs to us and our children. Now, do everything God told you to do.\u201d", "17": "So Jacob got up, put his sons and wives on the camels,", "18": "and set out with all of his livestock and all of his possessions that he had acquired[a] in Paddan-aram in order to return to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.", "19": "Now, while Laban was out shearing his sheep, Rachel stole the household's divine images that belonged to her father.", "20": "Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not sending word to him that he was leaving.", "21": "So Jacob and his entire household left.

God saw my harsh treatment and my hard work and reprimanded you yesterday.\u201d", "43": "Laban responded and told Jacob, \u201cThe daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. Everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and about their sons?", "44": "Come, let's make a treaty, you and me, and let something be our witness.\u201d[b]", "45": "So Jacob took a stone, set it up as a sacred pillar,", "46": "and said to his relatives, \u201cGather stones.\u201d So they took stones, made a mound, and ate there near the mound.", "47": "Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha,[c] but Jacob called it Galeed.[d]", "48": "Laban said, \u201cThis mound is our witness today,\u201d and, therefore, he too named it Galeed.", "49": "He also named it Mizpah,[e] because he said, \u201cThe Lord will observe both of us when we are separated from each other.", "50": "If you treat my daughters badly and if you marry other women, though we aren't there, know that God observed our witness.\u201d", "51": "Laban said to Jacob, \u201cHere is this mound and here is the sacred pillar that I've set up for us.", "52": "This mound and the sacred pillar are witnesses that I won't travel beyond this mound and that you won't travel beyond this mound and this pillar to do harm.", "53": "The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor[f] will keep order between us.\u201d So Jacob gave his word in the name of the awesome one of his father Isaac.", "54": "Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and invited his relatives to a meal. They ate together and spent the night on the mountain.", "55": "[g] Laban got up early in the morning, kissed his sons and daughters, blessed them, and left to go back to his own place."}

He didn't do what was right in the Lord's eyes, unlike his ancestor David.", "2": "Instead, he walked in the ways of Israel's kings, making images of the Baals", "3": "and burning incense in the Ben-hinnom Valley. He even burned his own sons alive, imitating the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.", "4": "He also sacrificed and burned incense at the shrines on every hill and beneath every shady tree.", "5": "So the Lord his God handed him over to Aram's king, who defeated him and carried off many prisoners, bringing them to Damascus.

When the army arrived there, he went to meet them and said, \u201cDon't you see that the Lord God of your ancestors was angry with Judah and let you defeat them? But look what you've done! Your merciless slaughter of them stinks to high heaven!", "10": "And now you think you can enslave the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem? What about your own guilt before the Lord your God?", "11": "Listen to me! Send back the captives you took from your relatives, because the Lord is furious with you.\u201d", "12": "At this, some of the Ephraimite leaders\u2014Johanan's son Azariah, Meshillemoth's son Berechiah, Shallum's son Jehizkiah, and Hadlai's son Amasa\u2014confronted those returning from battle.", "13": "\u201cDon't bring the captives here,\u201d they told them. \u201cYour plan will only add to our sin and guilt before the Lord. We're already guilty enough, and great anger is already directed at Israel.\u201d", "14": "So the warriors released the captives and brought the loot before the officers and the whole assembly.", "15": "Then people named for this task took charge of the captives and dressed everyone who was naked with items taken from the loot. They gave them clothing, sandals, food and drink, and bandaged their wounds. Everyone who couldn't walk they placed on donkeys, and they brought them to Jericho, Palm City, near their Judean relatives.

His mother's name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.", "2": "He did what was right in the Lord's eyes but not with all his heart.", "3": "Once he had secured control over his kingdom, he executed the officials who had assassinated his father the king.", "4": "However, he didn't kill their children because of what is written in the Instruction scroll from Moses, where the Lord commanded, Parents shouldn't be executed because of what their children have done; neither should children be executed because of what their parents have done. Each person should be executed for their own guilty acts.[a]", "5": "Amaziah gathered the people of Judah, organizing them into family units under captains of thousands and hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He summoned everyone 20 years old and older and found that there were three hundred thousand select troops, ready for service and able to handle spears and body-sized shields.", "6": "He also hired one hundred thousand warriors from Israel for one hundred kikkars of silver.", "7": "But a man of God confronted him. \u201cKing,\u201d he said, \u201cthe troops from Israel must not go with you, because the Lord isn't on the side of Israel or any Ephraimite.", "8": "Should you go with them anyway, even if you fight fiercely, God will make you stumble before the enemy, because God has the ability to either help or make someone stumble.\u201d", "9": "Amaziah asked the man of God, \u201cWhat about the hundred kikkars I paid for the Israelite troops?\u201d \u201cGod can give you much more than that,\u201d the man of God replied.", "10": "Amaziah released the Ephraimite troops who had joined him so they could go home, but this only infuriated them against Judah, and they left in a rage.", "11": "Amaziah courageously led his people to the Salt Valley, where they killed ten thousand people from Seir.", "12": "The Judean forces captured another ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of a cliff, and threw them off so that all were dashed to pieces.", "13": "Meanwhile, the troops Amaziah had released from fighting alongside him raided cities in Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, killing three thousand people and carrying off a large amount of loot.", "14": "When Amaziah returned after defeating the Edomites, he brought the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down before them, and burned incense to them.", "15": "As a result, the Lord was angry with Amaziah and sent a prophet to him. \u201cWhy do you seek the gods of this people?\u201d the prophet asked. \u201cThey couldn't even deliver their own people from you!\u201d", "16": "\u201cSince when do you give me advice?\u201d Amaziah interrupted. \u201cYou better quit before you end up dead!\u201d So the prophet stopped, but not until he said, \u201cI know God plans to destroy you because you've done this and because you've refused to listen to my advice.\u201d", "17": "After Judah's King Amaziah consulted with his advisors, he sent a challenge to Israel's King Joash, Jehoahaz's son and Jehu's grandson. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201clet's go head-to-head!\u201d", "18": "Israel's King Joash sent the following reply to Judah's King Amaziah: \u201cOnce upon a time, a thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar: 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.'

Why invite disaster when both you and Judah will fall?\u201d", "20": "But Amaziah wouldn't listen, because God intended to use this to destroy them since they had sought Edom's gods.", "21": "So Israel's King Joash moved against Judah's King Amaziah and went head-to-head in battle at Beth-shemesh in Judah.", "22": "Judah was defeated by Israel, and everyone ran home.", "23": "At Beth-shemesh, Israel's King Joash captured Judah's King Amaziah, Jehoash's[b] son and Ahaziah's[c] grandson.

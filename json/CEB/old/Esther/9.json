On the very day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them, the tables were turned against them. The Jews overpowered their enemies instead.", "2": "The Jews joined together in their towns in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to defend themselves against those who tried to harm them. No one was able to stand in their way because everyone was afraid of the Jews.", "3": "All the leaders of the provinces, rulers, governors, and those in charge of the king's business helped the Jews because they were afraid of Mordecai.", "4": "Because Mordecai was very important in the palace, news about him was sweeping through the provinces. Indeed, Mordecai was becoming more and more important every day.", "5": "The Jews put down all their enemies with sword blows, killing, and destruction. They did whatever they wanted with those who hated them.", "6": "In the fortified part of Susa, the Jews killed five hundred people.", "7": "They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,", "8": "Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,", "9": "Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.", "10": "These were the ten sons of Haman, Hammedatha's son, the enemy of the Jews.

What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces? What do you wish now? I'll give it to you. What is your desire? I'll do it this time too.\u201d", "13": "Esther answered, \u201cIf the king wishes, let the Jews who are in Susa also have tomorrow to do what the law allows for today.

They impaled the ten sons of Haman just as she said.", "15": "The Jews in Susa joined together again, this time on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar.

But they rested on the fifteenth day of the month and made it a day of feasts and joyous events.)", "19": "That is why Jews who live in villages make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of rejoicing and feasts, a holiday.

He had servants throw pur (that is, the dice) to find the best month and day to trouble greatly and destroy them.", "25": "But when Esther came before the king, his written order said: The wicked plan that Haman made against the Jews should turn back on him instead. So they impaled him and his sons on pointed poles.", "26": "That is why people call these days Purim, by using the ancient word pur. It all fit with what this letter said, with what they saw happen, and with what they themselves went through.", "27": "The Jews agreed that they, their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, as well as all non-Jews who become Jews, should always keep these two days.

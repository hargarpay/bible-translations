But Mordecai didn't kneel or bow down.", "3": "So the royal workers at the King's Gate said to Mordecai, \u201cWhy don't you obey the king's order?\u201d", "4": "Day after day they questioned him, but he paid no attention to them. So they let Haman know about it just to see whether or not Mordecai's words would hold true.[b] (He had told them that he was a Jew.)", "5": "When Haman himself saw that Mordecai didn't kneel or bow down to him, he became very angry.", "6": "But he decided not to kill only Mordecai, for people had told him Mordecai's race. Instead, he planned to wipe out all the Jews, Mordecai's people, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.", "7": "In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan)[c] in the twelfth year of the rule of King Ahasuerus, servants threw pur, namely, dice, in front of Haman to find the best day for his plan. They tried every day and every month, and the dice chose the thirteenth[d] day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).", "8": "Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, \u201cA certain group of people exist in pockets among the other peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of everyone else, and they refuse to obey the king's laws. There's no good reason for the king to put up with them any longer.", "9": "If the king wishes, let a written order be sent out to destroy them, and I will hand over ten thousand kikkars of silver[e] to those in charge of the king's business.

The orders were for the king's rulers and the governors in charge of each province, as well as for the officials of each people. They wrote in the alphabet of each province and in the language of each people. They wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed the order with the king's royal ring.", "13": "Fast runners were to take the order to all the provinces of the king. The order commanded people to wipe out, kill, and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, even women and little children. This was to happen on a single day\u2014the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).[f] They were also to seize their property.", "14": "A copy of the order was to become law in each province and to be posted in public for all peoples to read.

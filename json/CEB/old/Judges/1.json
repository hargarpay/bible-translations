Then we'll go with you into your territory too.\u201d So Simeon went with them.", "4": "When Judah went up, the Lord handed them the Canaanites and Perizzites. They defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.", "5": "There they found Adoni-bezek at Bezek, fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites.", "6": "Adoni-bezek fled, but they chased after him, captured him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.", "7": "He said, \u201cSeventy kings with severed thumbs and big toes used to pick up scraps under my table, so God has paid me back exactly for what I did.\u201d They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.", "8": "The people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They killed its people with their swords and set the city on fire.", "9": "Afterward, the people of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the highlands, the southern plain,[a] and the western foothills.[b]", "10": "Judah moved against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron, known before as Kiriath-arba, and they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.", "11": "From there they moved against those who lived in Debir, known before as Kiriath-sepher.", "12": "Caleb said, \u201cI'll give my daughter Achsah as a wife to the one who defeats and captures Kiriath-sepher.\u201d", "13": "Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.", "14": "When she arrived, she convinced Othniel to ask her father for a certain piece of land.

He named it Luz, which is still its name today.", "27": "The tribe of Manasseh didn't drive out the people in Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, or any of their villages. The Canaanites were determined to live in that land.", "28": "When Israel became stronger they forced the Canaanites to work for them, but they didn't completely drive them out.", "29": "The tribe of Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites kept on living there with them.", "30": "The tribe of Zebulun didn't drive out the people living in Kitron or Nahalol.

{"1": "After Ehud had died, the Israelites again did things that the Lord saw as evil.", "2": "So the Lord gave them over to King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, and he was stationed in Harosheth-ha-goiim.", "3": "The Israelites cried out to the Lord because Sisera[a] had nine hundred iron chariots and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly for twenty years.", "4": "Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth,[b] was a leader of Israel at that time.", "5": "She would sit under Deborah's palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the Ephraim highlands, and the Israelites would come to her to settle disputes.", "6": "She sent word to Barak, Abinoam's son, from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, \u201cHasn't the Lord, Israel's God, issued you a command? 'Go and assemble at Mount Tabor, taking ten thousand men from the people of Naphtali and Zebulun with you.", "7": "I'll lure Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, to assemble with his chariots and troops against you at the Kishon River, and then I'll help you overpower him.'\u201d", "8": "Barak replied to her, \u201cIf you'll go with me, I'll go; but if not, I won't go.\u201d", "9": "Deborah answered, \u201cI'll definitely go with you. However, the path you're taking won't bring honor to you, because the Lord will hand over Sisera to a woman.\u201d Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.", "10": "He summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men marched out behind him. Deborah marched out with him too.", "11": "Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law, and had settled as far away as Elon-bezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.", "12": "When it was reported to Sisera that Barak, Abinoam's son, had marched up to Mount Tabor,", "13": "Sisera summoned all of his nine hundred iron chariots and all of the soldiers who were with him from Harosheth-ha-goiim to the Kishon River.", "14": "Then Deborah said to Barak, \u201cGet up! This is the day that the Lord has handed Sisera over to you. Hasn't the Lord gone out before you?\u201d So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind him.", "15": "The Lord threw Sisera and all the chariots and army into a panic[c] before Barak; Sisera himself got down from his chariot and fled on foot.", "16": "Barak pursued the chariots and the army all the way back to Harosheth-ha-goiim, killing Sisera's entire army with the sword. No one survived.", "17": "Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Hazor's King Jabin and the family of Heber the Kenite.", "18": "Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, \u201cCome in, sir, come in here. Don't be afraid.\u201d So he went with her into the tent, and she hid him under a blanket.", "19": "Sisera said to her, \u201cPlease give me a little water to drink. I'm thirsty.\u201d So she opened a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and hid him again.", "20": "Then he said to her, \u201cStand at the entrance to the tent. That way, if someone comes and asks you, 'Is there a man here?' you can say, 'No.'\u201d", "21": "But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent stake and a hammer. While Sisera was sound asleep from exhaustion, she tiptoed to him. She drove the stake through his head and down into the ground, and he died.", "22": "Just then, Barak arrived after chasing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him and said, \u201cCome and I'll show you the man you're after.\u201d So he went in with her, and there was Sisera, lying dead, with the stake through his head.", "23": "So on that day God brought down Canaan's King Jabin before the Israelites.", "24": "And the power of the Israelites grew greater and greater over Canaan's King Jabin until they defeated him completely."}

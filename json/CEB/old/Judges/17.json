{"1": "Once there was a man named Micah who lived in the Ephraim highlands.", "2": "He said to his mother, \u201cThe eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you led you to declare a curse and even to repeat it when I could hear. I have that silver. I'm the one who took it, and now I'll give it back to you.\u201d[a] His mother replied, \u201cMay the Lord bless you, my son!\u201d", "3": "When he gave the eleven hundred pieces of silver back to his mother, she said, \u201cI wholeheartedly devote this silver to the Lord, to be made into a sculpted image and a molded image for my son.\u201d", "4": "So he gave the silver back to his mother, and she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used it for a sculpted image and a molded image. And they were placed in Micah's house.", "5": "This man Micah had his own sanctuary.[b] He made a priestly vest[c] and divine images[d] and appointed one of his sons to be his personal priest.", "6": "In those days there was no king in Israel; each person did what they thought to be right.", "7": "Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the area of the Judahite clan. He was a Levite residing there as an immigrant.", "8": "The man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to settle as an immigrant wherever he could find a place. He came to Micah's house in the Ephraim highlands while he was making his way.[e]", "9": "\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Micah asked him. He replied, \u201cI'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I'm looking to settle as an immigrant anywhere I can find a place.\u201d", "10": "So Micah said to him, \u201cStay with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I'll give you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your basic needs.\u201d[f]", "11": "The Levite agreed to stay with him; and the young man became like one of his own sons.", "12": "Micah appointed the Levite so that the young man became his personal priest and lived in Micah's sanctuary.", "13": "And Micah said to himself, Now I know that the Lord will give me good things, because a Levite has become my priest."}

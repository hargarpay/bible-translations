{"1": "The Israelites received these inheritances in the land of Canaan. Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes assigned them.", "2": "Their legacy was assigned by lot, exactly as the Lord had commanded the nine and a half tribes through Moses.", "3": "In fact, Moses had given out the legacy of the two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan. But he gave no legacy among them to the Levites.", "4": "The people of Joseph consisted of two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites weren't given any portion of the land, except cities to live in and pastureland for their cattle and flocks.", "5": "The Israelites divided up the land exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.", "6": "In Gilgal, the people of Judah approached Joshua. Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, \u201cYou know what the Lord said to Moses, man of God, about you and me when we were in Kadesh-barnea.", "7": "I was 40 years old when Moses the Lord's servant sent me from Kadesh-barnea to scout out the land. I brought back a report to him of what I really thought.", "8": "My companions who had gone up with me made the people's heart melt. But I remained loyal to the Lord my God.", "9": "So Moses pledged on that day, 'The land on which you have walked will forever be a legacy for you and your children. This is because you remained loyal to the Lord my God.'", "10": "Now look. The Lord has kept me alive, exactly as he promised. It is forty-five years since the Lord spoke about this to Moses. It was while Israel was journeying in the desert. Now look. Today I'm 85 years old.", "11": "I'm just as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out. My strength then was as my strength is now, whether for war or for everyday activities.", "12": "So now, give me this highland that the Lord promised me that day. True, the Anakim are there with large fortified cities, as you yourself heard that day. But if the Lord is with me, I should be able to remove them, exactly as the Lord promised.\u201d", "13": "So Joshua blessed him. He gave Hebron to Caleb, Jephunneh's son, as a legacy.", "14": "So Hebron still belongs to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as a legacy today. This was because he remained loyal to the Lord God of Israel.", "15": "(Hebron used to be called Kiriath-arba. Arba had been the greatest of the Anakim.) Then the land rested from war."}

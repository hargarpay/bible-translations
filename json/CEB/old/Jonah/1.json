{"1": "The Lord's word came to Jonah, Amittai's son:", "2": "\u201cGet up and go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it, for their evil has come to my attention.\u201d", "3": "So Jonah got up\u2014to flee to Tarshish from the Lord! He went down to Joppa and found a ship headed for Tarshish. He paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.", "4": "But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea, so that there was a great storm on the sea; the ship looked like it might be broken to pieces.", "5": "The sailors were terrified, and each one cried out to his god. They hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to make it lighter. Now Jonah had gone down into the hold of the vessel to lie down and was deep in sleep.", "6": "The ship's officer came and said to him, \u201cHow can you possibly be sleeping so deeply? Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps the god will give some thought to us so that we won't perish.\u201d", "7": "Meanwhile, the sailors said to each other, \u201cCome on, let's cast lots so that we might learn who is to blame for this evil that's happening to us.\u201d They cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.", "8": "So they said to him, \u201cTell us, since you're the cause of this evil happening to us: What do you do and where are you from? What's your country and of what people are you?\u201d", "9": "He said to them, \u201cI'm a Hebrew. I worship the Lord, the God of heaven\u2014who made the sea and the dry land.\u201d", "10": "Then the men were terrified and said to him, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d (The men knew that Jonah was fleeing from the Lord, because he had told them.)", "11": "They said to him, \u201cWhat will we do about you so that the sea will become calm around us?\u201d (The sea was continuing to rage.)", "12": "He said to them, \u201cPick me up and hurl me into the sea! Then the sea will become calm around you. I know it's my fault that this great storm has come upon you.\u201d", "13": "The men rowed to reach dry land, but they couldn't manage it because the sea continued to rage against them.", "14": "So they called on the Lord, saying, \u201cPlease, Lord, don't let us perish on account of this man's life, and don't blame us for innocent blood! You are the Lord: whatever you want, you can do.\u201d", "15": "Then they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased its raging.", "16": "The men worshipped the Lord with a profound reverence; they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made solemn promises.", "17": "[a] Meanwhile, the Lord provided a great fish to swallow Jonah. Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights."}

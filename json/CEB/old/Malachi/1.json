They will call themselves a wicked territory, the people against whom the Lord rages forever.", "5": "Your eyes will see it and you will say, \u201cMay the Lord be great beyond the borders of Israel.\u201d", "6": "A son honors a father, and a servant honors his master. But if I'm a father, where is my honor? Or if I'm a master, where is my respect? says the Lord of heavenly forces to you priests who despise my name.

Listen! An uproar of kingdoms, of nations coming together. The Lord of heavenly forces is mustering an army for battle.", "5": "They are coming from a distant land, from the faraway heavens, the Lord and the instruments of his fury, to destroy the whole land.", "6": "Wail, for the day of the Lord is near. Like destruction from the Almighty[b] it will come.", "7": "Then all hands will fall limp; every human heart will melt,", "8": "and they will be terrified. Like a woman writhing in labor, they will be seized by spasms and agony. They will look at each other aghast, their faces blazing.", "9": "Look, the day of the Lord is coming with cruel rage and burning anger, making the earth a ruin, and wiping out its sinners.", "10": "Heaven's stars and constellations won't show their light.

{"1": "See here: A king rules to promote righteousness; rulers govern to promote justice,", "2": "each like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from a storm, like streams of water in a wasteland, like the shade of a massive cliff in a worn-out land.", "3": "Then the eyes of those who can see will no longer be blind, the ears of those who can hear will listen,", "4": "the minds of the rash will know and comprehend, and the tongues of those who stammer will speak fluently and plainly.", "5": "Then a fool will no longer be called honorable, nor a villain considered respectable.", "6": "Fools speak folly; their minds devise wickedness, acting irreverently, speaking falsely of the Lord, leaving the hungry empty, and depriving the thirsty of drink.", "7": "As for the villain, his villainies are evil. He plans schemes to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speak justly.", "8": "But an honorable person plans honorable things and stands up for what is honorable.", "9": "Women of leisure, stand up! Hear my voice! Carefree daughters, listen to my word!", "10": "In a little over a year, the carefree will shudder, because the grape harvest will fail; the vintage won't arrive.", "11": "Tremble, all of you who are at ease; shudder, all of you who are secure! Strip yourselves, bare your skin, and tie mourning clothes around your waist,", "12": "beating your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,", "13": "for my people's soil growing barbs and thorns, for all the joyous houses in the jubilant town.", "14": "The palace will be deserted, the crowded city abandoned. Stronghold and watchtower will become empty fields forever, suited for the pleasure of wild donkeys, and a pasture for flocks\u2014", "15": "until a spirit from on high is poured out on us, and the desert turns into farmland, and the farmland is considered a forest.", "16": "Then justice will reside in wild lands, and righteousness will abide in farmlands.", "17": "The fruit of righteousness will be peace, and the outcome of righteousness, calm and security forever.", "18": "Then my people will live in a peaceful dwelling, in secure homes, in carefree resting places.", "19": "Even if the forest falls[a] and the humbled city is laid low,", "20": "those who sow beside any stream will be happy, sending out ox and donkey to graze."}

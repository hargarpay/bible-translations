{"1": "The Lord says: Where's your mother's divorce decree, with which I sent her away? Or to which lender did I sell you? On account of your sins you were sold; on account of your transgressions your mother was sent away.", "2": "Why did I come and find no one? Why did I call when no one answered? Is my hand too small to redeem you?[a] Don't I have enough power to save? With my rebuke I dry up the sea and make the rivers into wilderness. Their fish stink from lack of water; they die of thirst.", "3": "I clothe the heavens with darkness and cover them with funeral clothing.", "4": "The Lord God gave me an educated tongue to know how to respond to the weary with a word that will awaken them in the morning.[b] God awakens my ear in the morning to listen, as educated people do.", "5": "The Lord God opened my ear; I didn't rebel; I didn't turn my back.", "6": "Instead, I gave my body to attackers, and my cheeks to beard pluckers. I didn't hide my face from insults and spitting.", "7": "The Lord God will help me; therefore, I haven't been insulted. Therefore, I set my face like flint, and knew I wouldn't be ashamed.", "8": "The one who will declare me innocent is near. Who will argue with me? Let's stand up together. Who will bring judgment against me? Let him approach me.", "9": "Look! The Lord God will help me. Who will condemn me? Look, they will wear out like clothing; the moth will eat them.", "10": "Who among you fears the Lord? Who listens to the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light? They will trust in the Lord's name, and rely upon their God.", "11": "Look! All of you are kindling fire, igniting torches. Walk by the light of your fire, by the torches you have ignited. This is what will happen to you by my hand: you will lie down in grief."}

{"1": "An oracle about the Valley of Vision. What is wrong with you, that you have all gone up to the rooftops,", "2": "you who are filled with noise, you roaring city, you party town? Your dead weren't slaughtered by the sword; they didn't die in battle.", "3": "All your leaders escaped together but were captured without a single bow shot. All your escapees were bound together, even though they fled far away.[a]", "4": "Therefore, I said, \u201cDon't look at me; let me weep bitterly. Don't try to comfort me about the destruction of my dearly loved people.\u201d", "5": "The Lord God of heavenly forces has a day of tumult and trampling and turmoil in the Valley of Vision, a breaking down of walls, a cry for help to the mountains.", "6": "Elam carried the quiver with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.", "7": "Your finest valleys were filled with chariots, and horsemen doggedly guarded the gate.", "8": "Judah's covering has been stripped away. On that day, you trusted the weapons in the Forest House.", "9": "You observed the many broken defenses in David's City, and you collected the waters of the lower pool.", "10": "You counted Jerusalem's houses, and you tore down houses to fortify the wall.", "11": "You made a reservoir between the walls for the water of the earlier pool. But you didn't trust its maker; you didn't consider the one who planned it long ago.", "12": "The Lord God of heavenly forces called on that day for weeping and mourning, and shaven heads, and wearing of mourning clothes.", "13": "But instead there was fun and frivolity, killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: \u201cEat and drink! Tomorrow we will die!\u201d", "14": "But the Lord of heavenly forces has revealed in my hearing: This iniquity won't be forgiven you until you die, says the Lord God of heavenly forces.", "15": "The Lord God of heavenly forces says, Go now to this official, to Shebna, who is in charge of the house, and say to him:", "16": "What do you have here\u2014and whom do you have here\u2014 that you have hewed out a tomb for yourself, you who cuts his grave on high and carves himself a home in the cliff?", "17": "The Lord is about to hurl you down, mighty man! He is surely going to cover you with darkness;", "18": "he will indeed unroll your head wrapping, rolling it like a ball into the open country. There you will die, with your glorious chariots, you disgrace to the house of your master!", "19": "I will thrust you from your monument; you will be pulled down from your platform.", "20": "On that day, I will call my servant Eliakim, Hilkiah's son.", "21": "I will give him your robe and wrap him in your sash, and I will hand over to him your authority. He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.", "22": "I will place the key to David's house on his shoulder; what he opens no one will close, and what he closes no one will open.", "23": "I will fasten him securely like a tent peg, and he will be a throne of honor for his ancestors' house.", "24": "All the honor of his household will hang on him, the offspring and the offshoots, every little dish, every bowl, every jar.", "25": "On that day, says the Lord of heavenly forces, the peg that is fastened securely will give way; it will be cut down, and it will fall, and all the load hanging on it will be lost. The Lord has spoken."}

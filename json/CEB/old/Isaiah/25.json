{"1": "Lord, you are my God. I will exalt you; I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, planned long ago, faithful and sure.", "2": "You have turned the city into rubble, the fortified town into a ruin, the fortress of foreigners into a city no more, never to be rebuilt.", "3": "Therefore, strong people will glorify you; the towns of tyrant nations will fear you.", "4": "You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in distress, a hiding place from the storm, a shade from the heat. When the breath of tyrants is like a winter[a] storm", "5": "or like heat in the desert, you subdue the roar of foreigners. Like heat shaded by a cloud, the tyrants' song falls silent.", "6": "On this mountain, the Lord of heavenly forces will prepare for all peoples a rich feast, a feast of choice wines, of select foods rich in flavor, of choice wines well refined.", "7": "He will swallow up on this mountain the veil that is veiling all peoples, the shroud enshrouding all nations.", "8": "He will swallow up death[b] forever. The Lord God will wipe tears from every face; he will remove his people's disgrace from off the whole earth, for the Lord has spoken.", "9": "They will say on that day, \u201cLook! This is our God, for whom we have waited\u2014 and he has saved us! This is the Lord, for whom we have waited; let's be glad and rejoice in his salvation!\u201d", "10": "The Lord's hand will indeed rest on this mountain.

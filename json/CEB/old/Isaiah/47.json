{"1": "Go down and sit in the dust, virgin Daughter Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, Daughter Chaldea, because they will no longer call you tender and pampered.", "2": "Take the millstones and grind flour! Remove your veil, strip off your robe, expose your thighs, wade through the rivers!", "3": "Your nakedness will be exposed, and your disgrace will be seen. I will take vengeance; no one will intervene.[a]", "4": "Our redeemer has spoken; the Lord of heavenly forces is his name, the holy one of Israel.", "5": "Sit silent and go into darkness, Daughter Chaldea, because they will no longer call you Queen of Kingdoms.", "6": "I was enraged with my people; I made my inheritance impure and put them under your power. You took no pity on them. You made your yoke heavy even on the elderly.", "7": "You said, \u201cI'm forever; I'm the eternal mistress.\u201d You didn't stop and think; you didn't consider the outcome.", "8": "So listen to this, luxuriant one who sits secure, who says in her heart, I'm utterly unique; I'll never sit as a widow; I'll never know childlessness:", "9": "Both of these will happen to you at once, on a single day: childlessness and widowhood will envelop you in full measure, despite your many sorceries, despite your very powerful spells.", "10": "You felt secure in your evil; you said, \u201cNo one sees me.\u201d Your wisdom and knowledge spun you around. You thought to yourself, I and no one else.", "11": "Now evil will come against you, something you won't anticipate. A curse will fall upon you, something you won't be able to dispel. Destruction will come upon you suddenly, something you won't foresee.", "12": "Continue with your enchantments, and with your many spells, which you have practiced since childhood. Maybe you will be able to succeed. Maybe you will inspire terror.", "13": "You are weary from all your consultations; let the astrologers stand up and save you, those who gaze at the stars, and predict what will happen to you at each new moon.", "14": "They are just like stubble; the fire burns them. They won't save themselves from the powerful flames. This is no warming ember or fire to sit beside.", "15": "Those with whom you have wearied yourself are like this, those with whom you were in business from your youth: each has wandered off on their own way; none will save you."}

He warms himself and says, \u201cAh, I'm warm, watching the fire!\u201d", "17": "And the rest of it he makes into a god, into his idol, and he bows down, worships, and prays to it, saying, \u201cSave me, for you are my god!\u201d", "18": "They don't know or comprehend, for their eyes can't see and their minds can't comprehend.", "19": "He doesn't think, and has no knowledge or understanding to think: Half of it I burned in the fire, and I baked bread on its coals, and roasted meat and ate.

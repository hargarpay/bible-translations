I'm here!\u201d to a nation that didn't call on my name.", "2": "I extended my hands all day to a rebellious people walking in a way that isn't good, following their own plans;", "3": "people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense on bricks,", "4": "who sit in tombs and spend the night among rocks;[a] who eat swine's flesh with broth of unclean meat in their bowls;", "5": "who say, \u201cKeep to yourself! Keep away from me! I'm too holy for you.\u201d These people ignite my anger like a fire that burns all day.", "6": "Look, this stands written before me. I won't be silent, but I will repay; I will repay in full measure", "7": "your sins and the sins of your ancestors as well, says the Lord.

You will all bow down for slaughter, because I called and you didn't answer; I spoke and you wouldn't hear. You did what I considered evil, and chose what I didn't want.", "13": "Therefore, the Lord God says: Look, my servants will eat, but you will hunger. My servants will drink, but you will thirst. My servants will rejoice, but you will be ashamed.", "14": "My servants will sing with contented hearts, but you will cry out from heartache; with broken spirits you will wail.", "15": "You will leave your name behind for my chosen ones to curse: \u201cMay the Lord God kill you!

{"1": "An oracle about Moab. Ar was devastated in a night; Moab is ruined! Kir was devastated in a night; Moab is ruined!", "2": "Dibon has gone up to the temple, to the shrines to weep.[a] Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard cut off.", "3": "In its streets they wear mourning clothes; on its rooftops and in its plazas, everyone wails and falls down weeping.", "4": "Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; as far as Jahaz their voice is heard. The armed men of Moab shout, spirits trembling.", "5": "My heart cries out for Moab. Its fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah.[b] At the ascent of Luhith, each will go up with weeping. On the road to Horonaim, they will raise a piercing cry.", "6": "The waters of Nimrim are used up. Grass has withered; vegetation is dead; greenery is gone.", "7": "Therefore, they carry what they had stored up, all their provisions to the Valley of the Willows.", "8": "An outcry sounds within the borders of Moab, as far as Eglaim, a cry of distress, as far as Beer-elim, a cry of distress.", "9": "The waters of Dibon are full of blood. But I will bring still more upon Dibon: a lion for Moab's survivors, for the remaining few in the land."}

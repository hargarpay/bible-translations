{"1": "Oh, Ariel, Ariel, town where David encamped! Year by year, let the festivals come around\u2014", "2": "but I will oppress Ariel. There will be mourning and lamentation; she will be like an Ariel to me.", "3": "I will surround you like a wall, and I will lay a siege against you with assault towers, and I will raise up siegeworks against you.", "4": "You will be brought down; from the ground you will speak; from low in the dust your speech will come. Your voice will be like a ghost's from the earth; from the dust your words will whisper.", "5": "But your many enemies will be like fine dust, the terrible horde like passing chaff. Suddenly, in an instant,", "6": "the Lord of heavenly forces will come to you with thunder, earthquake, and a mighty voice, with whirlwind, tempest, and flames of devouring fire.", "7": "The horde of nations fighting against Ariel, and all who make war on her and her fortress and besiege her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.", "8": "It will be like when a hungry person dreams of eating but wakes up and the mouth is empty. Or when a thirsty person dreams of drinking but wakes up and has a dry throat. So will it be for all the horde of nations who fight against Mount Zion.", "9": "Be shocked and stunned; blind yourselves; be blind! Be drunk, but not on wine; stagger, but not on account of beer!", "10": "The Lord has poured on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has shut your eyes, you prophets, and covered your heads, you seers.", "11": "This entire vision has become for you like the words of a sealed scroll. When they give it to one who can read, saying, \u201cRead this,\u201d that one will say, \u201cI can't, because it's sealed.\u201d", "12": "And when the scroll is given to one who can't read, saying, \u201cRead this,\u201d that one will say, \u201cI can't read.\u201d", "13": "The Lord says: Since these people turn toward me with their mouths, and honor me with lip service while their heart is distant from me, and their fear of me is just a human command that has been memorized,", "14": "I will go on doing amazing things to these people, shocking and startling things. The wisdom of their wise will perish, and the discernment of their discerning will be hidden.", "15": "Doom to those who hide their plan deep, away from the Lord, whose deeds are in the dark, who say, \u201cWho sees us? Who knows us?\u201d", "16": "You have everything backward! Should the potter be thought of as clay? Should what is made say of its maker, \u201cHe didn't make me\u201d?

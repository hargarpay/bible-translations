{"1": "In the year of King Uzziah's death, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne, the edges of his robe filling the temple.", "2": "Winged creatures were stationed around him. Each had six wings: with two they veiled their faces, with two their feet, and with two they flew about.", "3": "They shouted to each other, saying: \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of heavenly forces! All the earth is filled with God's glory!\u201d", "4": "The doorframe shook at the sound of their shouting, and the house was filled with smoke.", "5": "I said, \u201cMourn for me; I'm ruined! I'm a man with unclean lips, and I live among a people with unclean lips. Yet I've seen the king, the Lord of heavenly forces!\u201d", "6": "Then one of the winged creatures flew to me, holding a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs.", "7": "He touched my mouth and said, \u201cSee, this has touched your lips. Your guilt has departed, and your sin is removed.\u201d", "8": "Then I heard the Lord's voice saying, \u201cWhom should I send, and who will go for us?\u201d I said, \u201cI'm here; send me.\u201d", "9": "God said, \u201cGo and say to this people: Listen intently, but don't understand; look carefully, but don't comprehend.", "10": "Make the minds of this people dull. Make their ears deaf and their eyes blind, so they can't see with their eyes or hear with their ears, or understand with their minds, and turn, and be healed.\u201d", "11": "I said, \u201cHow long, Lord?\u201d And God said, \u201cUntil cities lie ruined with no one living in them, until there are houses without people and the land is left devastated.\u201d", "12": "The Lord will send the people far away, and the land will be completely abandoned.", "13": "Even if one-tenth remain there, they will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, which when it is cut down leaves a stump. Its stump is a holy seed."}

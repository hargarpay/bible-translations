It is I, proclaiming righteousness, powerful to save!", "2": "Why is your clothing red, and your garments like those of one who stomps on grapes?", "3": "I have pressed out in the vat by myself\u2014from the peoples, no one was with me. I stomped on them in my anger, trampled them in my wrath. Their blood splashed on my garments, and stained all my clothing,", "4": "because I intended a day of vengeance; the year of my deliverance had arrived.", "5": "I looked and found no helper; I was astonished to find no supporter. But my arm brought victory for me; my wrath helped me.", "6": "I trampled down nations in my anger and made them drunk on my wrath; I spilled their blood on the ground.", "7": "I will recount the Lord's faithful acts; I will sing the Lord's praises, because of all the Lord did for us, for God's great favor toward the house of Israel. God treated them compassionately and with deep affection.", "8": "God said, \u201cTruly, they are my people, children who won't do what is wrong.\u201d God became their savior.", "9": "During all their distress, God also was distressed, so a messenger who served him saved them.

You, Lord, are our father; your reputation since long ago is that of our redeemer.", "17": "Why do you lead us astray, Lord, from your ways? Why do you harden our heart so we don't fear you? Return for the sake of your servants the tribes that are your heritage!", "18": "Why did the wicked bring down your holy place?[e] Why did our enemies trample your sanctuary?", "19": "For too long we have been like those you don't rule, like those not known by your name."}

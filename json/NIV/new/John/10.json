He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.", "4": "When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.", "5": "But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice.\u201d", "6": "Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.", "7": "Therefore Jesus said again, \u201cVery truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.", "8": "All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.", "9": "I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.[a] They will come in and go out, and find pasture.", "10": "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.", "11": "\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.", "12": "The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away.

There he stayed,", "41": "and many people came to him. They said, \u201cThough John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true.\u201d", "42": "And in that place many believed in Jesus."}

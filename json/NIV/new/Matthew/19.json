They asked, \u201cIs it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?\u201d", "4": "\u201cHaven't you read,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,'[a]", "5": "and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'[b]?", "6": "So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\u201d", "7": "\u201cWhy then,\u201d they asked, \u201cdid Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\u201d", "8": "Jesus replied, \u201cMoses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard.

You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.[a]", "4": "A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Jesus then left them and went away.", "5": "When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.", "6": "\u201cBe careful,\u201d Jesus said to them. \u201cBe on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d", "7": "They discussed this among themselves and said, \u201cIt is because we didn't bring any bread.\u201d", "8": "Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, \u201cYou of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?", "9": "Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?", "10": "Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?", "11": "How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d", "12": "Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.", "13": "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d", "14": "They replied, \u201cSome say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\u201d", "15": "\u201cBut what about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho do you say I am?\u201d", "16": "Simon Peter answered, \u201cYou are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\u201d", "17": "Jesus replied, \u201cBlessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.", "18": "And I tell you that you are Peter,[b] and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades[c] will not overcome it.", "19": "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be[d] bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be[e] loosed in heaven.\u201d", "20": "Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.", "21": "From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.", "22": "Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \u201cNever, Lord!\u201d he said. \u201cThis shall never happen to you!\u201d", "23": "Jesus turned and said to Peter, \u201cGet behind me, Satan!

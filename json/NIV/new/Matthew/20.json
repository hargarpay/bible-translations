He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'", "7": "\u201c'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. \u201cHe said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'", "8": "\u201cWhen evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'", "9": "\u201cThe workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.", "10": "So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more.

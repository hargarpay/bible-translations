{"1": "Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: \u201cA man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.", "2": "At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.", "3": "But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.", "4": "Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.", "5": "He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.", "6": "\u201cHe had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'", "7": "\u201cBut the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'", "8": "So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.", "9": "\u201cWhat then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.", "10": "Haven't you read this passage of Scripture: \u201c'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;", "11": "the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'[a]?\u201d", "12": "Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.", "13": "Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.", "14": "They came to him and said, \u201cTeacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax[b] to Caesar or not?", "15": "Should we pay or shouldn't we?\u201d But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. \u201cWhy are you trying to trap me?\u201d he asked. \u201cBring me a denarius and let me look at it.\u201d", "16": "They brought the coin, and he asked them, \u201cWhose image is this? And whose inscription?\u201d \u201cCaesar's,\u201d they replied.", "17": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cGive back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\u201d And they were amazed at him.", "18": "Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.", "19": "\u201cTeacher,\u201d they said, \u201cMoses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.", "20": "Now there were seven brothers.

Last of all, the woman died too.", "23": "At the resurrection[c] whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\u201d", "24": "Jesus replied, \u201cAre you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?", "25": "When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.", "26": "Now about the dead rising\u2014have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'[d]?", "27": "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

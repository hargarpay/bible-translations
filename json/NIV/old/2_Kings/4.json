{"1": "The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, \u201cYour servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves.\u201d", "2": "Elisha replied to her, \u201cHow can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?\u201d \u201cYour servant has nothing there at all,\u201d she said, \u201cexcept a small jar of olive oil.\u201d", "3": "Elisha said, \u201cGo around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few.", "4": "Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.\u201d", "5": "She left him and shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.", "6": "When all the jars were full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another one.\u201d But he replied, \u201cThere is not a jar left.\u201d Then the oil stopped flowing.", "7": "She went and told the man of God, and he said, \u201cGo, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.", "9": "She said to her husband, \u201cI know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.", "10": "Let's make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.\u201d", "11": "One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.", "12": "He said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cCall the Shunammite.\u201d So he called her, and she stood before him.", "13": "Elisha said to him, \u201cTell her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?'\u201d She replied, \u201cI have a home among my own people.\u201d", "14": "\u201cWhat can be done for her?\u201d Elisha asked. Gehazi said, \u201cShe has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "Then Elisha said, \u201cCall her.\u201d So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.", "16": "\u201cAbout this time next year,\u201d Elisha said, \u201cyou will hold a son in your arms.\u201d \u201cNo, my lord!\u201d she objected. \u201cPlease, man of God, don't mislead your servant!\u201d", "17": "But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.", "18": "The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.", "19": "He said to his father, \u201cMy head! My head!\u201d His father told a servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d", "20": "After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.", "21": "She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.", "22": "She called her husband and said, \u201cPlease send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.\u201d", "23": "\u201cWhy go to him today?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt's not the New Moon or the Sabbath.\u201d \u201cThat's all right,\u201d she said.", "24": "She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \u201cLead on; don't slow down for me unless I tell you.\u201d", "25": "So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook! There's the Shunammite!", "26": "Run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?'\u201d \u201cEverything is all right,\u201d she said.", "27": "When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why.\u201d", "28": "\u201cDid I ask you for a son, my lord?\u201d she said. \u201cDidn't I tell you, 'Don't raise my hopes'?\u201d", "29": "Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cTuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. Don't greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face.\u201d", "30": "But the child's mother said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d So he got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, \u201cThe boy has not awakened.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.", "33": "He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord.", "34": "Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out on him, the boy's body grew warm.", "35": "Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out on him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.", "36": "Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite.\u201d And he did. When she came, he said, \u201cTake your son.\u201d", "37": "She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.", "38": "Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, \u201cPut on the large pot and cook some stew for these prophets.\u201d", "39": "One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine and picked as many of its gourds as his garment could hold. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.", "40": "The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, \u201cMan of God, there is death in the pot!\u201d And they could not eat it.", "41": "Elisha said, \u201cGet some flour.\u201d He put it into the pot and said, \u201cServe it to the people to eat.\u201d And there was nothing harmful in the pot.", "42": "A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. \u201cGive it to the people to eat,\u201d Elisha said.", "43": "\u201cHow can I set this before a hundred men?\u201d his servant asked. But Elisha answered, \u201cGive it to the people to eat. For this is what the Lord says: 'They will eat and have some left over.'\u201d", "44": "Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord."}

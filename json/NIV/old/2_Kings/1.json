So he sent messengers, saying to them, \u201cGo and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.\u201d", "3": "But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, \u201cGo up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'", "4": "Therefore this is what the Lord says: 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'\u201d So Elijah went.", "5": "When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, \u201cWhy have you come back?\u201d", "6": "\u201cA man came to meet us,\u201d they replied. \u201cAnd he said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, \u201cThis is what the Lord says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on.

The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, \u201cMan of God, the king says, 'Come down!'\u201d", "10": "Elijah answered the captain, \u201cIf I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!\u201d Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.", "11": "At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men.

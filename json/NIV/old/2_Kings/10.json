He said,", "2": "\u201cYou have your master's sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you,", "3": "choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne. Then fight for your master's house.\u201d", "4": "But they were terrified and said, \u201cIf two kings could not resist him, how can we?\u201d", "5": "So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: \u201cWe are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.\u201d", "6": "Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, \u201cIf you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.\u201d Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.", "7": "When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them.

Jehu said to the servants of Baal, \u201cLook around and see that no one who serves the Lord is here with you\u2014only servants of Baal.\u201d", "24": "So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: \u201cIf one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.\u201d", "25": "As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: \u201cGo in and kill them; let no one escape.\u201d So they cut them down with the sword.

He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.", "32": "In those days the Lord began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory", "33": "east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.", "34": "As for the other events of Jehu's reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?", "35": "Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria.

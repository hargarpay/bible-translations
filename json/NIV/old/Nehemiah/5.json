{"1": "Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews.", "2": "Some were saying, \u201cWe and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.\u201d", "3": "Others were saying, \u201cWe are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.\u201d", "4": "Still others were saying, \u201cWe have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.", "5": "Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.\u201d", "6": "When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.", "7": "I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, \u201cYou are charging your own people interest!\u201d So I called together a large meeting to deal with them", "8": "and said: \u201cAs far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!\u201d They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.", "9": "So I continued, \u201cWhat you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?", "10": "I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest!", "11": "Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest you are charging them\u2014one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil.\u201d", "12": "\u201cWe will give it back,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.\u201d Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.", "13": "I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, \u201cIn this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!\u201d At this the whole assembly said, \u201cAmen,\u201d and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.", "14": "Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year\u2014twelve years\u2014neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.", "15": "But the earlier governors\u2014those preceding me\u2014placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels[a] of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.", "16": "Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we[b] did not acquire any land.", "17": "Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.", "18": "Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.", "19": "Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people."}

I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.\u201d", "32": "So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.", "33": "Then food was set before him, but he said, \u201cI will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.\u201d \u201cThen tell us,\u201d Laban said.", "34": "So he said, \u201cI am Abraham's servant.", "35": "The Lord has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy.

If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, \u201cPlease let me drink a little water from your jar,\u201d", "44": "and if she says to me, \u201cDrink, and I'll draw water for your camels too,\u201d let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my master's son.'", "45": "\u201cBefore I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'", "46": "\u201cShe quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.", "47": "\u201cI asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' \u201cShe said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.' \u201cThen I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,", "48": "and I bowed down and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son.", "49": "Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.\u201d", "50": "Laban and Bethuel answered, \u201cThis is from the Lord; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.", "51": "Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the Lord has directed.\u201d", "52": "When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord.", "53": "Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.", "54": "Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, \u201cSend me on my way to my master.\u201d", "55": "But her brother and her mother replied, \u201cLet the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you[e] may go.\u201d", "56": "But he said to them, \u201cDo not detain me, now that the Lord has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.\u201d", "57": "Then they said, \u201cLet's call the young woman and ask her about it.\u201d", "58": "So they called Rebekah and asked her, \u201cWill you go with this man?\u201d \u201cI will go,\u201d she said.", "59": "So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.", "60": "And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, \u201cOur sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies.\u201d", "61": "Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.", "62": "Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.", "63": "He went out to the field one evening to meditate,[f] and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.", "64": "Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel", "65": "and asked the servant, \u201cWho is that man in the field coming to meet us?\u201d \u201cHe is my master,\u201d the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.", "66": "Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.", "67": "Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."}

So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.", "19": "After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again.", "20": "Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.", "21": "He asked the men who lived there, \u201cWhere is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?\u201d \u201cThere hasn't been any shrine prostitute here,\u201d they said.", "22": "So he went back to Judah and said, \u201cI didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'\u201d", "23": "Then Judah said, \u201cLet her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock.

And she added, \u201cSee if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.\u201d", "26": "Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah.\u201d And he did not sleep with her again.", "27": "When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.", "28": "As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, \u201cThis one came out first.\u201d", "29": "But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, \u201cSo this is how you have broken out!\u201d And he was named Perez.[a]", "30": "Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out.

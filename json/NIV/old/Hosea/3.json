Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.\u201d", "2": "So I bought her for fifteen shekels[a] of silver and about a homer and a lethek[b] of barley.", "3": "Then I told her, \u201cYou are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.\u201d", "4": "For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods.", "5": "Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the last days."}

{"1": "Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz.", "2": "And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, \u201cLet me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.\u201d Naomi said to her, \u201cGo ahead, my daughter.\u201d", "3": "So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.", "4": "Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, \u201cThe Lord be with you!\u201d \u201cThe Lord bless you!\u201d they answered.", "5": "Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, \u201cWho does that young woman belong to?\u201d", "6": "The overseer replied, \u201cShe is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi.", "7": "She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.\u201d", "8": "So Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cMy daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me.", "9": "Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.\u201d", "10": "At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, \u201cWhy have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me\u2014a foreigner?\u201d", "11": "Boaz replied, \u201cI've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband\u2014how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.", "12": "May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.\u201d", "13": "\u201cMay I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant\u2014though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.\u201d", "14": "At mealtime Boaz said to her, \u201cCome over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.\u201d When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.", "15": "As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, \u201cLet her gather among the sheaves and don't reprimand her.", "16": "Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her.\u201d", "17": "So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.[a]", "18": "She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.", "19": "Her mother-in-law asked her, \u201cWhere did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!\u201d Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. \u201cThe name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,\u201d she said.", "20": "\u201cThe Lord bless him!\u201d Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. \u201cHe has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.\u201d She added, \u201cThat man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers.[b]\u201d", "21": "Then Ruth the Moabite said, \u201cHe even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'\u201d", "22": "Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, \u201cIt will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else's field you might be harmed.\u201d", "23": "So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law."}

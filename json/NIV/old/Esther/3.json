Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.", "5": "When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.", "6": "Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.", "7": "In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day and month.

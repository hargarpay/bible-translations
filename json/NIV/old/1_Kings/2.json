He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.", "6": "Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.", "7": "\u201cBut show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.", "8": "\u201cAnd remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.'", "9": "But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him.

All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the Lord.", "16": "Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.\u201d \u201cYou may make it,\u201d she said.", "17": "So he continued, \u201cPlease ask King Solomon\u2014he will not refuse you\u2014to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.\u201d", "18": "\u201cVery well,\u201d Bathsheba replied, \u201cI will speak to the king for you.\u201d", "19": "When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne.

You might as well request the kingdom for him\u2014after all, he is my older brother\u2014yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!\u201d", "23": "Then King Solomon swore by the Lord: \u201cMay God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!", "24": "And now, as surely as the Lord lives\u2014he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised\u2014Adonijah shall be put to death today!\u201d", "25": "So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.", "26": "To Abiathar the priest the king said, \u201cGo back to your fields in Anathoth.

At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.'", "43": "Why then did you not keep your oath to the Lord and obey the command I gave you?\u201d", "44": "The king also said to Shimei, \u201cYou know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the Lord will repay you for your wrongdoing.", "45": "But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the Lord forever.\u201d", "46": "Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died.

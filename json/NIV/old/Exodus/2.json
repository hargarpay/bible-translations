When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.", "3": "But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket[a] for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.", "4": "His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.", "5": "Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.", "6": "She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. \u201cThis is one of the Hebrew babies,\u201d she said.", "7": "Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, \u201cShall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?\u201d", "8": "\u201cYes, go,\u201d she answered. So the girl went and got the baby's mother.", "9": "Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \u201cTake this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.\u201d So the woman took the baby and nursed him.", "10": "When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses,[b] saying, \u201cI drew him out of the water.\u201d", "11": "One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor.

Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?\u201d Then Moses was afraid and thought, \u201cWhat I did must have become known.\u201d", "15": "When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.", "16": "Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.", "17": "Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.", "18": "When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, \u201cWhy have you returned so early today?\u201d", "19": "They answered, \u201cAn Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds.

Let my people go, so that they may worship me.", "4": "If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.", "5": "They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.", "6": "They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians\u2014something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'\u201d Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.", "7": "Pharaoh's officials said to him, \u201cHow long will this man be a snare to us?

Clearly you are bent on evil.[a]", "11": "No! Have only the men go and worship the Lord, since that's what you have been asking for.\u201d Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.", "12": "And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cStretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.\u201d", "13": "So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the Lord made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;", "14": "they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.", "15": "They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail\u2014everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.", "16": "Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord your God and against you.", "17": "Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away from me.\u201d", "18": "Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord.", "19": "And the Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea.[b] Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.", "20": "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.", "21": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cStretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt\u2014darkness that can be felt.\u201d", "22": "So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.", "23": "No one could see anyone else or move about for three days.

We have to use some of them in worshiping the Lord our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the Lord.\u201d", "27": "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.", "28": "Pharaoh said to Moses, \u201cGet out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.\u201d", "29": "\u201cJust as you say,\u201d Moses replied. \u201cI will never appear before you again.\u201d"}

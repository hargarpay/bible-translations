{"1": "Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, \u201cI'm going to my wife's room.\u201d But her father would not let him go in.", "2": "\u201cI was so sure you hated her,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I gave her to your companion. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead.\u201d", "3": "Samson said to them, \u201cThis time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them.\u201d", "4": "So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,", "5": "lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.", "6": "When the Philistines asked, \u201cWho did this?\u201d they were told, \u201cSamson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his companion.\u201d So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.", "7": "Samson said to them, \u201cSince you've acted like this, I swear that I won't stop until I get my revenge on you.\u201d", "8": "He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.", "9": "The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.", "10": "The people of Judah asked, \u201cWhy have you come to fight us?\u201d \u201cWe have come to take Samson prisoner,\u201d they answered, \u201cto do to him as he did to us.\u201d", "11": "Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, \u201cDon't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?\u201d He answered, \u201cI merely did to them what they did to me.\u201d", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWe've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.\u201d Samson said, \u201cSwear to me that you won't kill me yourselves.\u201d", "13": "\u201cAgreed,\u201d they answered. \u201cWe will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.\u201d So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.", "14": "As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.", "15": "Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.", "16": "Then Samson said, \u201cWith a donkey's jawbone I have made donkeys of them.[a] With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a thousand men.\u201d", "17": "When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.[b]", "18": "Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the Lord, \u201cYou have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?\u201d", "19": "Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore,[c] and it is still there in Lehi.", "20": "Samson led[d] Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines."}

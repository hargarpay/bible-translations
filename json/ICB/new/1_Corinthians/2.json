{"1": "Dear brothers, when I came to you, I did not come as a proud man. I preached God's truth, but not with fancy words or a show of great learning. ", "2": "I decided that while I was with you I would forget about everything except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross. ", "3": "When I came to you, I was weak and shook with fear. ", "4": "My teaching and my speaking were not with wise words that persuade people. But the proof of my teaching was the power that the Spirit gives. ", "5": "I did this so that your faith would be in God's power, not in the wisdom of a man.", "6": "Yet I speak wisdom to those who are mature. But this wisdom is not from this world or of the rulers of this world. (These rulers are losing their power.) ", "7": "But I speak God's secret wisdom, which he has kept hidden. God planned this wisdom for our glory, before the world began. ", "8": "None of the rulers of this world understood it. If they had, they would not have killed the Lord of glory on a cross.

No one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.\u201d Isaiah 64:4", "10": "But God has shown us these things through the Spirit. The Spirit knows all things, even the deep secrets of God. ", "11": "It is like this: No one knows the thoughts that another person has. Only a person's spirit that lives in him knows his thoughts.

He cannot understand the Spirit's gifts, because they can only be judged spiritually. ", "15": "But the spiritual person is able to judge all things. Yet no one can judge him. The Scripture says:", "16": "\u201cWho has known the mind of the Lord? Who has been able to teach him?\u201d Isaiah 40:13 But we have the mind of Christ."}

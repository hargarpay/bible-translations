You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols\u2014things that have no life. ", "3": "So I tell you that no one who is speaking with the help of God's Spirit says, \u201cJesus be cursed.\u201d And no one can say, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d without the help of the Holy Spirit.", "4": "There are different kinds of gifts; but they are all from the same Spirit.

God works in us all in everything we do. ", "7": "Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person, to help everyone. ", "8": "The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom. And the same Spirit gives another the ability to speak with knowledge. ", "9": "The same Spirit gives faith to one person. And that one Spirit gives another gifts of healing. ", "10": "The Spirit gives to another person the power to do miracles, to another the ability to prophesy. And he gives to another the ability to know the difference between good and evil spirits.

The Spirit decides what to give each person.", "12": "A person's body is one thing, but it has many parts. Yes, there are many parts to a body, but all those parts make only one body. Christ is like that too. ", "13": "Some of us are Jews, and some of us are Greeks. Some of us are slaves, and some of us are free. But we were all baptized into one body through one Spirit.

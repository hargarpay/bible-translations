", "7": "So you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again. ", "8": "Jesus will keep you strong until the end. He will keep you strong, so that there will be no wrong in you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. ", "9": "God is faithful. He is the One who has called you to share life with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.", "10": "I beg you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I beg that all of you agree with each other, so that you will not be divided into groups. I beg that you be completely joined together by having the same kind of thinking and the same purpose.

", "15": "I am thankful, because now no one can say that you were baptized in my name. ", "16": "(I also baptized the family of Stephanas. But I do not remember that I myself baptized any others.) ", "17": "Christ did not give me the work of baptizing people. He gave me the work of preaching the Good News, and he sent me to preach the Good News without using words of worldly wisdom.

But to us who are being saved it is the power of God. ", "19": "It is written in the Scriptures: \u201cI will cause the wise men to lose their wisdom.

Not many of you had great influence. Not many of you came from important families. ", "27": "But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. ", "28": "And he chose what the world thinks is not important. He chose what the world hates and thinks is nothing. He chose these to destroy what the world thinks is important. ", "29": "God did this so that no man can brag before him. ", "30": "It is God who has made you part of Christ Jesus. Christ has become wisdom for us from God. Christ is the reason we are right with God and have freedom from sin; Christ is the reason we are holy.

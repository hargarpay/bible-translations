{"1": "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.", "2": "I praise you because you remember me in everything. You follow closely the teachings that I gave you. ", "3": "But I want you to understand this: The head of every man is Christ. And the head of a woman is the man.[a] And the head of Christ is God. ", "4": "Every man who prophesies or prays with his head covered brings shame to his head. ", "5": "But every woman who prays or prophesies should have her head covered. If her head is not covered, she brings shame to her head. She is the same as a woman who has her head shaved. ", "6": "If a woman does not cover her head, it is the same as cutting off all her hair. But it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or to shave her head. So she should cover her head. ", "7": "But a man should not cover his head, because he is made like God and is God's glory. But woman is man's glory. ", "8": "Man did not come from woman, but woman came from man. ", "9": "And man was not made for woman. Woman was made for man. ", "10": "So that is why a woman should have her head covered with something to show that she is under authority. And also she should do this because of the angels.", "11": "But in the Lord the woman is important to the man, and the man is important to the woman. ", "12": "This is true because woman came from man, but also man is born from woman. Really, everything comes from God. ", "13": "Decide this for yourselves: Is it right for a woman to pray to God without something on her head? ", "14": "Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man. ", "15": "But wearing long hair is a woman's honor. Long hair is given to the woman to cover her head. ", "16": "Some people may still want to argue about this. But I would add that neither we nor the churches of God accept any other practice.", "17": "In the things I tell you now I do not praise you. Your meetings hurt you more than they help you. ", "18": "First, I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided. And I believe some of this. ", "19": "(It is necessary for there to be differences among you. That is the way to make it clear which of you are really doing right.) ", "20": "When you all come together, you are not really eating the Lord's Supper.[b] ", "21": "This is because when you eat, each person eats without waiting for the others. Some people do not get enough to eat, while others have too much to drink. ", "22": "You can eat and drink in your own homes! It seems that you think God's church is not important. You embarrass those who are poor. What should I tell you? Should I praise you for doing this? I do not praise you.", "23": "The teaching that I gave you is the same teaching that I received from the Lord: On the night when Jesus was handed over to be killed, he took bread ", "24": "and gave thanks for it. Then he broke the bread and said, \u201cThis is my body; it is[c] for you. Do this to remember me.\u201d ", "25": "In the same way, after they ate, Jesus took the cup. He said, \u201cThis cup shows the new agreement from God to his people. This new agreement begins with the blood of my death. When you drink this, do it to remember me.\u201d ", "26": "Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show others about the Lord's death until he comes.", "27": "So a person should not eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that is not worthy of it. If he does he is sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord. ", "28": "Everyone should look into his own heart before he eats the bread and drinks the cup. ", "29": "If someone eats the bread and drinks the cup without recognizing the body, then he is judged guilty by eating and drinking. ", "30": "That is why many in your group are sick and weak. And some of you have died. ", "31": "But if we judged ourselves in the right way, then God would not judge us. ", "32": "But when the Lord judges us, he disciplines us to show us the right way. He does this so that we will not be destroyed along with the world.", "33": "So my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. ", "34": "If anyone is too hungry, he should eat at home. Do this so that your meeting together will not bring God's judgment on you. I will tell you what to do about the other things when I come."}

She had an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. The woman opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus' head.", "4": "Some of those who were there saw this and became angry. They complained to each other, saying, \u201cWhy waste that perfume? ", "5": "It was worth a full year's work. It could be sold, and the money could be given to the poor.\u201d They spoke to the woman sharply.", "6": "Jesus said, \u201cDon't bother the woman. Why are you troubling her? She did a beautiful thing for me. ", "7": "You will always have the poor with you. You can help them anytime you want. But you will not always have me. ", "8": "This woman did the only thing she could do for me. She poured perfume on my body. She did this before I die to prepare me for burial. ", "9": "I tell you the truth. The Good News will be told to people in all the world. And in every place it is preached, what this woman has done will be told. And people will remember her.\u201d", "10": "One of the 12 followers, Judas Iscariot, went to talk to the leading priests. Judas offered to give Jesus to them.

Where do you want to eat the feast?\u201d", "13": "Jesus sent two of his followers and said to them, \u201cGo into the city. A man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.

But I will not.\u201d", "30": "Jesus answered, \u201cI tell you the truth. Tonight you will say you don't know me. You will say this three times before the rooster crows twice.\u201d", "31": "But Peter answered strongly, \u201cI will never say that I don't know you! I will even die with you!\u201d And all the other followers said the same thing.", "32": "Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his followers, \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ", "33": "Jesus told Peter, James, and John to come with him. Then Jesus began to be very sad and troubled.

Let me not have this cup[d] of suffering. But do what you want, not what I want.\u201d", "37": "Then Jesus went back to his followers. He found them asleep. He said to Peter, \u201cSimon, why are you sleeping? You could not stay awake with me for one hour? ", "38": "Stay awake and pray that you will not be tempted. Your spirit wants to do what is right, but your body is weak.\u201d", "39": "Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing. ", "40": "Then he went back to the followers. Again he found them asleep because their eyes were very heavy. And they did not know what to say to Jesus.", "41": "After Jesus prayed a third time, he went back to his followers. He said to them, \u201cYou are still sleeping and resting? That's enough! The time has come for the Son of Man to be given to sinful people. ", "42": "Get up! We must go. Here comes the man who has turned against me.\u201d", "43": "While Jesus was still speaking, Judas came up. Judas was 1 of the 12 followers. He had many people with him. They were sent from the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish elders. Those with Judas had swords and clubs.", "44": "Judas had planned a signal for them. He had said, \u201cThe man I kiss is Jesus. Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away.\u201d ", "45": "So Judas went to Jesus and said, \u201cTeacher!\u201d and kissed him.

", "49": "Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple. You did not arrest me there. But all these things have happened to make the Scriptures come true.\u201d ", "50": "Then all of Jesus' followers left him and ran away.", "51": "A young man, wearing only a linen cloth, was following Jesus. The people also grabbed him. ", "52": "But the cloth he was wearing came off, and he ran away naked.", "53": "The people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest.

But the council could find no proof against him. ", "56": "Many people came and told false things about him. But all said different things\u2014none of them agreed.", "57": "Then some men stood up and lied about Jesus. They said, ", "58": "\u201cWe heard this man say, 'I will destroy this Temple that men made. And three days later, I will build another Temple\u2014a Temple not made by men.'\u201d ", "59": "But even the things these men said did not agree.", "60": "Then the high priest stood before them and said to Jesus, \u201cAren't you going to answer the charges these men bring against you?\u201d ", "61": "But Jesus said nothing. He did not answer. The high priest asked Jesus another question: \u201cAre you the Christ, the Son of the blessed God?\u201d", "62": "Jesus answered, \u201cI am. And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of the Powerful One. And you will see the Son of Man coming on clouds in the sky.\u201d", "63": "When the high priest heard this, he was very angry. He tore his clothes and said, \u201cWe don't need any more witnesses! ", "64": "You all heard him say these things against God. What do you think?\u201d They all said that Jesus was guilty and should be killed. ", "65": "Some of the people there spit at Jesus. They covered his eyes and hit him with their fists. They said, \u201cProve that you are a prophet!\u201d Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him.", "66": "Peter was still in the courtyard when a servant girl of the high priest came there.

He said, \u201cI don't know or understand what you are talking about.\u201d Then Peter left and went toward the entrance of the courtyard.[e]", "69": "The servant girl saw Peter there. Again she said to the people who were standing there, \u201cThis man is one of those who followed Jesus.\u201d ", "70": "Again Peter said that it was not true. A short time later, some people were standing near Peter. They said, \u201cWe know you are one of those who followed Jesus. You are from Galilee, too.\u201d", "71": "Then Peter began to curse. He said, \u201cI swear that I don't know this man you're talking about!\u201d", "72": "As soon as Peter said this, the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don't know me.\u201d Then Peter was very sad and began to cry."}

", "6": "John wore clothes made from camel's hair and had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. ", "7": "This is what John preached to the people: \u201cThere is one coming later who is greater than I. I am not good enough even to kneel down and untie his sandals. ", "8": "I baptize you with water. But the one who is coming will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\u201d", "9": "At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the place where John was.

", "11": "A voice came from heaven and said: \u201cYou are my Son and I love you. I am very pleased with you.\u201d", "12": "Then the Spirit sent Jesus into the desert alone.

I will make you fishermen for men.\u201d ", "18": "So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him.", "19": "Jesus continued walking by Lake Galilee. He saw two more brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in their boat, preparing their nets to catch fish. ", "20": "Their father Zebedee and the men who worked for him were in the boat with the brothers. When Jesus saw the brothers, he called them to come with him. They left their father and followed Jesus.", "21": "Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. On the Sabbath day Jesus went to the synagogue and began to teach. ", "22": "The people there were amazed at his teaching. He did not teach like their teachers of the law. He taught like a person who had authority.

He even gives commands to evil spirits, and they obey him.\u201d ", "28": "And the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of Galilee.", "29": "Jesus and his followers left the synagogue. They all went at once with James and John to the home of Simon[c] and Andrew. ", "30": "Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever. The people there told Jesus about her. ", "31": "So Jesus went to her bed, took her hand, and helped her up. Immediately the fever left her, and she was healed. Then she began serving them.", "32": "That night, after the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick. They also brought those who had demons in them. ", "33": "The whole town gathered at the door of the house. ", "34": "Jesus healed many who had different kinds of sicknesses. He also forced many demons to leave people. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.", "35": "Early the next morning, Jesus woke and left the house while it was still dark. He went to a place to be alone and pray. ", "36": "Later, Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus. ", "37": "They found him and said, \u201cEveryone is looking for you!\u201d", "38": "Jesus answered, \u201cWe should go somewhere else, to other towns around here. Then I can preach there too. That is the reason I came.\u201d ", "39": "So he traveled everywhere in Galilee. He preached in the synagogues and forced demons to leave people.", "40": "A man who had a harmful skin disease came to Jesus. The man fell to his knees and begged Jesus, \u201cI know that you can heal me if you will.\u201d", "41": "Jesus felt sorry for the man. So he touched him and said, \u201cI want to heal you. Be healed!\u201d ", "42": "At once the disease left the man, and he was healed.", "43": "Jesus told the man to go at once. But Jesus warned him strongly, ", "44": "\u201cDon't tell anyone about what I did for you. But go and show yourself to the priest. And offer a gift to God because you have been healed. Offer the gift that Moses commanded.[d] This will show the people that you are healed.\u201d ", "45": "The man left there, but he told everyone he saw that Jesus had healed him. So the news about Jesus spread. That is the reason Jesus could not enter a town if people saw him. He stayed in places where nobody lived. But people came from all the towns to wherever he was."}

Is it right to save a life or to destroy one?\u201d But they said nothing to answer him.", "5": "Jesus was angry as he looked at the people. But he felt very sad because they were stubborn. Then he said to the man, \u201cLet me see your hand.\u201d The man put his hand out for Jesus, and it was healed. ", "6": "Then the Pharisees left and began making plans with the Herodians[a] about a way to kill Jesus.", "7": "Jesus left with his followers for the lake. A large crowd from Galilee followed him. ", "8": "Also many people came from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumea, from the lands across the Jordan River, and from the area of Tyre and Sidon. They came because they had heard about all the things Jesus was doing. ", "9": "Jesus saw the crowds. So he told his followers to get a boat ready for him. He wanted the boat so that the many people would not crowd themselves against him. ", "10": "He had healed many people. So all the sick were pushing toward him to touch him.

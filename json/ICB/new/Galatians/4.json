{"1": "I want to tell you this: While the one who will inherit his father's property is still a child, he is no different from a slave. It does not matter that the child owns everything. ", "2": "While he is a child, he must obey those who are chosen to care for him. But when the child reaches the age set by his father, he is free. ", "3": "It is the same for us. We were once like children. We were slaves to the useless rules of this world. ", "4": "But when the right time came, God sent his Son. His Son was born of a woman and lived under the law. ", "5": "God did this so that he could buy freedom for those who were under the law. His purpose was to make us his children.", "6": "And you are God's children. That is why God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts. The Spirit cries out, \u201cFather, dear Father.\u201d[a] ", "7": "So now you are not a slave; you are God's child, and God will give you what he promised, because you are his child.", "8": "In the past you did not know God. You were slaves to gods that were not real. ", "9": "But now you know the true God. Really, it is God who knows you. So why do you turn back to those weak and useless rules you followed before? Do you want to be slaves to those things again? ", "10": "You still follow teachings about special days, months, seasons, and years. ", "11": "I am afraid for you. I fear that my work for you has been wasted.", "12": "Brothers, I was like you; so I beg you to become like me. You were very good to me before. ", "13": "You remember that I came to you the first time because I was sick. That was when I preached the Good News to you. ", "14": "Though my sickness was a trouble for you, you did not hate me or make me leave. But you welcomed me as an angel from God, as if I were Jesus Christ himself! ", "15": "You were very happy then. Where is that joy now? I remember that you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me if that were possible. ", "16": "Now am I your enemy because I tell you the truth?", "17": "Those people[b] are working hard to persuade you. But this is not good for you. They want to persuade you to turn against us. They want you to follow only them. ", "18": "It is good for people to show interest in you, but only if their purpose is good. This is always true. It is true when I am with you and when I am away. ", "19": "My little children, again I feel pain for you as a mother feels when she gives birth. I will feel this until you truly become like Christ. ", "20": "I wish I could be with you now. Then maybe I could change the way I am talking to you. Now I do not know what to do about you.", "21": "Some of you people still want to be under the law of Moses. Tell me, do you know what the law says? ", "22": "The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one son was a slave woman. The mother of the other son was a free woman. ", "23": "Abraham's son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way. But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham.", "24": "This makes a picture for us. The two women are like the two agreements between God and men. One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai.[c] The people who are under this agreement are like slaves. The mother named Hagar is like that agreement. ", "25": "She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and is a picture of the earthly Jewish city of Jerusalem. This city is a slave, and all its people are slaves to the law. ", "26": "But the heavenly Jerusalem which is above is like the free woman. She is our mother. ", "27": "It is written in the Scriptures: \u201cBe happy, Jerusalem. You are like a woman who never gave birth to children. Start singing and shout for joy. You never felt the pain of giving birth to children. But you will have more children than the woman who has a husband.\u201d Isaiah 54:1", "28": "My brothers, you are God's children because of his promise, as Isaac was then. ", "29": "The son who was born in the normal way treated the other son badly. It is the same today. ", "30": "But what does the Scripture say? \u201cThrow out the slave woman and her son! The son of the free woman will receive everything his father has. But the son of the slave woman will receive nothing.\u201d[d] ", "31": "So, my brothers, we are not children of the slave woman. We are children of the free woman."}

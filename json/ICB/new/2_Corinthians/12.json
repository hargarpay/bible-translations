{"1": "I must continue to brag. It will do no good, but I will talk now about visions and revelations[a] from the Lord. ", "2": "I know a man in Christ who was taken up to the third heaven. This happened 14 years ago. I do not know whether the man was in his body or out of his body. But God knows. ", "3-4": "And I know that this man was taken up to paradise.[b] I don't know if he was in his body or away from his body. But he heard things he is not able to explain. He heard things that no man is allowed to tell. ", "5": "I will brag about a man like that. But I will not brag about myself, except about my weaknesses. ", "6": "But if I wanted to brag about myself, I would not be a fool. I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I will not brag about myself. I do not want people to think more of me than what they see me do or hear me say.", "7": "But I must not become too proud of the wonderful things that were shown to me. So a painful problem[c] was given to me. This problem is a messenger from Satan. It is sent to beat me and keep me from being too proud.

", "10": "So I am happy when I have weaknesses, insults, hard times, sufferings, and all kinds of troubles. All these things are for Christ. And I am happy, because when I am weak, then I am truly strong.", "11": "I have been talking like a fool. But you made me do it. You are the ones who should say good things about me. I am worth nothing, but those \u201cgreat apostles\u201d are not worth any more than I am! ", "12": "When I was with you, I did what proves that I am an apostle\u2014signs, wonders, and miracles. And I did these things with much patience. ", "13": "So you received everything that the other churches have received. Only one thing was different: I was not a burden to you. Forgive me for this!", "14": "I am now ready to visit you the third time. And I will not be a burden to you. I want nothing from you, I only want you.

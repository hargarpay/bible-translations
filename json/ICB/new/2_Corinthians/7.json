We should try to become perfect in the way we live, because we respect God.", "2": "Open your hearts to us. We have not done wrong to anyone. We have not ruined the faith of any person, and we have cheated no one. ", "3": "I do not say this to blame you. I told you before that we love you so much that we would live or die with you. ", "4": "I feel very sure of you. I am very proud of you. You give me much comfort. And in all of our troubles I have great joy.", "5": "When we came into Macedonia, we had no rest. We found trouble all around us. We had fighting on the outside and fear on the inside. ", "6": "But God comforts those who are troubled. And God comforted us when Titus came. ", "7": "We were comforted by his coming and also by the comfort that you gave him. Titus told us about your wish to see me. He told us that you are very sorry for what you did. And he told me about your great care for me. When I heard this, I was much happier.", "8": "Even if the letter I wrote you made you sad, I am not sorry I wrote it. I know it made you sad, and I was sorry for that. But it made you sad only for a short time. ", "9": "Now I am happy, but not because you were made sad. I am happy because your sorrow made you change your hearts. You became sad in the way God wanted you to. So you were not hurt by us in any way.

It made you angry and afraid. It made you want to see me. It made you care. It made you want the right thing to be done. You proved that you were not guilty in any part of the problem. ", "12": "I wrote that letter, but not because of the one who did the wrong. And it was not written because of the person who was hurt. But I wrote the letter so that you could see, before God, the great care that you have for us. ", "13": "That is why we were comforted. We were very comforted. And we were even happier to see that Titus was so happy. All of you made him feel much better. ", "14": "I bragged to Titus about you. And you showed that I was right. Everything that we said to you was true. And you have proved that what we bragged about to Titus is true. ", "15": "And his love for you is stronger when he remembers that you were all ready to obey. You welcomed him with respect and fear. ", "16": "I am very happy that I can trust you fully."}

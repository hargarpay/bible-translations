", "2": "I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for the Jewish people. ", "3": "I wish I could help my Jewish brothers, my people. I would even wish that I were cursed and cut off from Christ if that would help them. ", "4": "They are the people of Israel. They were God's chosen children. They have the glory of God and the agreements that God made between himself and his people. God gave them the law of Moses and the right way of worship. And God gave his promises to them. ", "5": "They are the descendants of our great ancestors, and they are the earthly family of Christ. Christ is God over all. Praise him forever![a] Amen.", "6": "I do not mean that God failed to keep his promise to them. But only some of the people of Israel are truly God's people.[b] ", "7": "And only some of Abraham's[c] descendants are true children of Abraham. But God said to Abraham: \u201cThe descendants I promised you will be from Isaac.\u201d[d] ", "8": "This means that not all of Abraham's descendants are God's true children. Abraham's true children are those who become God's children because of the promise God made to Abraham. ", "9": "God's promise to Abraham was this: \u201cAt the right time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d[e] ", "10": "And that is not all. Rebekah also had sons. And those sons had the same father, our father Isaac. ", "11-12": "But before the two boys were born, God told Rebekah, \u201cThe older will serve the younger.\u201d[f] This was before the boys had done anything good or bad. God said this before they were born so that the one chosen would be chosen because of God's own plan. He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call, not because of anything he did.

I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy.\u201d[h] ", "16": "So God will choose the one he decides to show mercy to. And his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do.

In this way my name will be talked about in all the earth.\u201d[i] ", "18": "So God shows mercy where he wants to show mercy. And he makes stubborn the people he wants to make stubborn.", "19": "So one of you will ask me: \u201cIf God controls the things we do, then why does he blame us for our sins? Who can fight his will?\u201d ", "20": "Do not ask that. You are only human. And human beings have no right to question God. An object cannot tell the person who made it, \u201cWhy did you make me like this?\u201d ", "21": "The man who makes a jar can make anything he wants to make. He can use the same clay to make different things. He can make one thing for special use and another thing for daily use.", "22": "It is the same way with what God has done. God wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power. But God patiently stayed with those people he was angry with\u2014people who were ready to be destroyed.

He has prepared these people to have his glory, and ", "24": "we are those people whom God called. He called us from the Jews and from the non-Jews. ", "25": "As the Scripture says in Hosea: \u201cI will say, 'You are my people' to those I had called 'not my people.'

They are like the grains of sand by the sea. But only a few of them will be saved.", "28": "For the Lord will quickly and completely punish the people on the earth.\u201d Isaiah 10:22-23", "29": "It is as Isaiah said: \u201cThe Lord of heaven's armies allowed a few of our descendants to live. Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.\u201d[j] Isaiah 1:9", "30": "So what does all this mean? It means this: the non-Jews were not trying to make themselves right with God. But they were made right with God because of their faith.

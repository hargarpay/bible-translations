So why am I judged a sinner?\u201d ", "8": "It would be the same to say, \u201cWe should do evil so that good will come.\u201d Some people find fault with us and say that we teach this. Those who say such things about us are wrong, and they should be punished.", "9": "So are we Jews better than others? No! We have already said that Jews and non-Jews are the same.

", "29": "Is God only the God of the Jews? Is he not also the God of the non-Jews? ", "30": "Of course he is, for there is only one God. He will make Jews right with him by their faith. And he will also make non-Jews right with him through their faith. ", "31": "So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith? No! Faith causes us to be what the law truly wants."}

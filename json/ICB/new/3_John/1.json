{"1": "From the Elder.[a] To my dear friend Gaius whom I love in the truth:[b]", "2": "My dear friend, I know your soul is doing well. I pray that you are doing fine in every way and that your health is good. ", "3": "Some brothers in Christ came and told me about the truth in your life. They said that you are following the way of truth. This made me very happy. ", "4": "It always gives me the greatest joy when I hear that my children are following the way of truth.", "5": "My dear friend, it is good that you continue to help the brothers. You are helping those that you do not even know! ", "6": "These brothers told the church about the love you have. Please help them to continue their trip. Help them in a way that will please God. ", "7": "They started out on their trip to serve Christ. They did not accept any help from those who are not believers. ", "8": "So we should help these brothers. And when we do, we share in their work for the truth.", "9": "I wrote a letter to the church. But Diotrephes will not listen to what we say. He always wants to be their leader. ", "10": "When I come, I will talk about what Diotrephes is doing. He lies and says evil things about us. But that is not all he does. He refuses to help those who are working to serve Christ. He also stops those who want to help the brothers and puts them out of the church.", "11": "My dear friend, do not follow what is bad; follow what is good. He who does what is good is from God. But he who does evil has never known God.", "12": "Everyone says good things about Demetrius. And the truth agrees with what they say. Also, we say good about him. And you know that what we say is true.", "13": "I have many things I want to tell you, but I do not want to use pen and ink. ", "14": "I hope to visit you soon. Then we can be together and talk. ", "15": "Peace to you. The friends here with me send their love. Please give our love to each one of the friends there."}

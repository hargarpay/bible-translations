{"1": "All who are slaves should show full respect to their masters. Then no one will speak against God's name and our teaching. ", "2": "Some slaves have masters who are believers. This means they are all brothers. But the slaves should not show their masters any less respect. They should serve their masters even better, because they are helping believers they love. You must teach and preach these things. ", "3": "If anyone has a different teaching, he does not accept the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. And that teaching shows him the true way to serve God. ", "4": "The person who teaches falsely is full of pride and understands nothing. He is sick with a love for arguing and fighting about words. And that brings jealousy, making trouble, insults, and evil mistrust. ", "5": "And that also brings arguments from men who have evil minds. They have lost the truth. They think that serving God is a way to get rich.", "6": "It is true that serving God makes a person very rich, if he is satisfied with what he has. ", "7": "When we came into the world, we brought nothing. And when we die, we can take nothing out. ", "8": "So, if we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with that. ", "9": "Those who want to become rich bring temptation to themselves. They are caught in a trap. They begin to want many foolish things that will hurt them, things that ruin and destroy people. ", "10": "The love of money causes all kinds of evil. Some people have left the true faith because they want to get more and more money. But they have caused themselves much sorrow.", "11": "But you are a man of God. So you should stay away from all those things. Try to live in the right way, serve God, have faith, love, patience, and gentleness. ", "12": "Keeping your faith is like running a race. Try as hard as you can to win. Be sure you receive the life that continues forever. You were called to have that life. And you confessed the great truth about Christ in a way that many people heard. ", "13": "Before God and Christ Jesus I give you a command. Christ Jesus confessed that same great truth when he stood before Pontius Pilate. And God gives life to everything. Now I tell you: ", "14": "Do the things you were commanded to do. Do them without wrong or blame until the time when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. ", "15": "God will make that happen at the right time. He is the blessed and only Ruler. He is the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords. ", "16": "God is the only One who never dies. He lives in light so bright that men cannot go near it. No one has ever seen God, or can see him. May honor and power belong to God forever. Amen.", "17": "Give this command to those who are rich with things of this world. Tell them not to be proud. Tell them to hope in God, not their money. Money cannot be trusted, but God takes care of us richly. He gives us everything to enjoy. ", "18": "Tell the rich people to do good and to be rich in doing good deeds. Tell them to be happy to give and ready to share. ", "19": "By doing that, they will be saving a treasure for themselves in heaven. That treasure will be a strong foundation. Their future life can be built on that treasure. Then they will be able to have the life that is true life.", "20": "Timothy, God has trusted you with many things. Keep those things safe. Stay away from people who say foolish things that are not from God. Stay away from those who argue against the truth. They use something they call \u201cknowledge,\u201d but it is really not knowledge. ", "21": "They say that they have that \u201cknowledge,\u201d but they have left the true faith. God's grace be with you."}

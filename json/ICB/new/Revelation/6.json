Then I heard the third living thing say, \u201cCome!\u201d I looked, and there before me was a black horse. Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. ", "6": "Then I heard something that sounded like a voice. It came from where the four living things were. The voice said, \u201cA quart of wheat for a day's pay. And three quarts of barley for a day's pay. And do not damage the olive oil and wine!\u201d", "7": "The Lamb opened the fourth seal. Then I heard the voice of the fourth living thing say, \u201cCome!\u201d ", "8": "I looked, and there before me was a pale horse. Its rider was named death. Hades[a] was following close behind him.

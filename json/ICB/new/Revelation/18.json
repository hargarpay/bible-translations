She has become a city for every evil spirit, a city for every unclean and hated bird.", "3": "All the peoples of the earth have drunk the strong wine of her sexual immorality. The kings of the earth have sinned sexually with her, and the businessmen of the world have grown rich from the great wealth of her luxury.\u201d", "4": "Then I heard another voice from heaven say: \u201cCome out of that city, my people, so that you will not share in her sins. Then you will not receive the terrible things that will happen to her.", "5": "The city's sins are piled up as high as the sky.

They sell all kinds of citron wood and all kinds of things made from ivory, expensive wood, bronze, iron, and marble. ", "13": "They also sell cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, and olive oil; fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, and carriages.

You will never have them again.\u201d", "15": "The businessmen will be afraid of her suffering and stand far away from her. These are the men who became rich from selling those things to her. The men will cry and be sad. ", "16": "They will say: \u201cTerrible! How terrible for the great city! She was dressed in fine linen, purple and red cloth. She was shining with gold, jewels, and pearls!", "17": "All these riches have been destroyed in one hour!\u201d Every sea captain, all those who travel on ships, the sailors, and all the people who earn money from the sea stood far away from Babylon.

The city will never be found again.", "22": "The music of people playing harps and other instruments, flutes and trumpets, will never be heard in you again. No workman doing any job will ever be found in you again. The sound of grinding grain will never be heard in you again.", "23": "The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your businessmen were the world's great men. All the nations were tricked by your magic.", "24": "She is guilty of the death of the prophets and God's holy people and of all who have been killed on earth.\u201d"}

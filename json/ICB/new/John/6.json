But that is not enough for so many people.\u201d", "10": "Jesus said, \u201cTell the people to sit down.\u201d This was a very grassy place. There were about 5,000 men who sat down there. ", "11": "Then Jesus took the loaves of bread. He thanked God for the bread and gave it to the people who were sitting there. He did the same with the fish. He gave them as much as they wanted.", "12": "They all had enough to eat. When they had finished, Jesus said to his followers, \u201cGather the pieces of fish and bread that were not eaten.

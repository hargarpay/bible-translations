{"1": "Later, Jesus showed himself to his followers by Lake Galilee.[a] This is how it happened: ", "2": "Some of the followers were together. They were Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other followers. ", "3": "Simon Peter said, \u201cI am going out to fish.\u201d The other followers said, \u201cWe will go with you.\u201d So they went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing.", "4": "Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore. But the followers did not know that it was Jesus. ", "5": "Then he said to them, \u201cFriends, have you caught any fish?\u201d They answered, \u201cNo.\u201d", "6": "He said, \u201cThrow your net into the water on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.\u201d So they did this. They caught so many fish that they could not pull the net back into the boat.", "7": "The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d When Peter heard him say this, he wrapped his coat around himself. (Peter had taken his clothes off.) Then he jumped into the water. ", "8": "The other followers went to shore in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about 100 yards. ", "9": "When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore, they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire, and there was bread.", "10": "Then Jesus said, \u201cBring some of the fish that you caught.\u201d", "11": "Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish. There were 153. Even though there were so many, the net did not tear. ", "12": "Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and eat.\u201d None of the followers dared ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord. ", "13": "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them. He also gave them the fish.", "14": "This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from death.", "15": "When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John do you love me more than these?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cTake care of my lambs.\u201d", "16": "Again Jesus said, \u201cSimon son of John do you love me?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cTake care of my sheep.\u201d", "17": "A third time he said, \u201cSimon son of John do you love me?\u201d Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d Peter said, \u201cLord, you know everything. You know that I love you!\u201d He said to him, \u201cTake care of my sheep. ", "18": "I tell you the truth. When you were younger, you tied your own belt and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands and someone else will tie them. They will take you where you don't want to go.\u201d ", "19": "(Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then Jesus said to Peter, \u201cFollow me!\u201d", "20": "Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said, \u201cLord, who will turn against you?\u201d) ", "21": "When Peter saw him behind them he asked Jesus, \u201cLord, what about him?\u201d", "22": "Jesus answered, \u201cPerhaps I want him to live until I come back. That should not be important to you. You follow me!\u201d", "23": "So a story spread among the brothers that this follower would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die. He only said, \u201cPerhaps I want him to live until I come back. That should not be important to you.\u201d", "24": "That follower is the one who is telling these things. He is the one who has now written them down. We know that what he says is true.", "25": "There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I think the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written."}

Then they put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus' mouth. ", "30": "Jesus tasted the vinegar. Then he said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d He bowed his head and died.", "31": "This day was Preparation Day. The next day was a special Sabbath day. The Jews did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day. So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken[d] and the bodies be taken away.

{"1": "When Jesus finished praying, he left with his followers. They went across the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden of olive trees. Jesus and his followers went there.", "2": "Judas knew where this place was, because Jesus met there often with his followers. Judas was the one who turned against Jesus. ", "3": "So Judas led a group of soldiers to the garden. Judas also brought some guards from the leading priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons.", "4": "Jesus knew everything that would happen to him. Jesus went out and asked, \u201cWho is it you are looking for?\u201d", "5": "The men answered, \u201cJesus from Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cI am Jesus.\u201d (Judas, the one who turned against Jesus, was standing there with them.) ", "6": "When Jesus said, \u201cI am Jesus,\u201d the men moved back and fell to the ground.", "7": "Jesus asked them again, \u201cWho is it you are looking for?\u201d They said, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d", "8": "Jesus said, \u201cI told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, then let these other men go.\u201d ", "9": "This happened so that the words Jesus said before might come true: \u201cI have not lost any of the men you gave me.\u201d", "10": "Simon Peter had a sword. He took out the sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) ", "11": "Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut your sword back. Shall I not drink of the cup[a] the Father has given me?\u201d", "12": "Then the soldiers with their commander and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus. They tied him ", "13": "and led him first to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. ", "14": "Caiaphas was the one who had told the Jews that it would be better if one man died for all the people.", "15": "Simon Peter and another one of Jesus' followers went along after Jesus. This follower knew the high priest. So he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard. ", "16": "But Peter waited outside near the door. The follower who knew the high priest came back outside. He spoke to the girl at the door and brought Peter inside. ", "17": "The girl at the door said to Peter, \u201cAren't you also one of that man's followers?\u201d Peter answered, \u201cNo, I am not!\u201d", "18": "It was cold, so the servants and guards had built a fire. They were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter was standing with them, warming himself.", "19": "The high priest asked Jesus questions about his followers and his teaching. ", "20": "Jesus answered, \u201cI have spoken openly to everyone. I have always taught in synagogues and in the Temple, where all the Jews come together. I never said anything in secret. ", "21": "So why do you question me? Ask the people who heard my teaching. They know what I said.\u201d", "22": "When Jesus said this, one of the guards standing there hit him. The guard said, \u201cIs that the way you answer the high priest?\u201d", "23": "Jesus answered him, \u201cIf I said something wrong, then say what was wrong. But if what I said is true, why do you hit me?\u201d", "24": "Then Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas, the high priest. Jesus was still tied.", "25": "Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, \u201cAren't you one of that man's followers?\u201d Peter denied it and said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d", "26": "One of the servants of the high priest was there. This servant was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off. The servant said, \u201cDidn't I see you with him in the garden?\u201d", "27": "Again Peter said it wasn't true. Just then a rooster crowed.", "28": "Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas' house to the Roman governor's palace. It was early in the morning. The Jews would not go inside the palace. They did not want to make themselves unclean,[b] because they wanted to eat the Passover meal. ", "29": "So Pilate went outside to them. He asked, \u201cWhat charges do you bring against this man?\u201d", "30": "They answered, \u201cHe is a criminal. That is why we brought him to you.\u201d", "31": "Pilate said to them, \u201cTake him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\u201d They answered, \u201cBut we are not allowed to put anyone to death.\u201d ", "32": "(This happened so that what Jesus had said about how he would die would come true.)", "33": "Then Pilate went back inside the palace. He called Jesus to him and asked, \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d", "34": "Jesus said, \u201cIs that your own question, or did others tell you about me?\u201d", "35": "Pilate answered, \u201cI am not a Jew. It was your own people and their leading priests who brought you before me. What have you done wrong?\u201d", "36": "Jesus said, \u201cMy kingdom does not belong to this world. If it belonged to this world, my servants would have fought to keep me from being given over to the Jewish leaders. But my kingdom is from another place.\u201d", "37": "Pilate said, \u201cSo you are a king!\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou say that I am a king. That is true. I was born for this: to tell people about the truth. That is why I came into the world. And everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me.\u201d", "38": "Pilate said, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d After he said this, he went out to the Jews again. He said to them, \u201cI can find nothing to charge against this man. ", "39": "But it is your custom that I free one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to free this 'king of the Jews'?\u201d", "40": "They shouted back, \u201cNo, not him! Let Barabbas go free!\u201d (Barabbas was a robber.)"}

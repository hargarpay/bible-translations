{"1": "Brothers, we have something to say about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to talk to you about that time when we will meet together with him. ", "2": "Do not become easily upset in your thinking or afraid if you hear that the day of the Lord has already come. Someone may have said this in a prophecy or in a message. Or you may read it in a letter that someone tells you came from us. ", "3": "Do not let any person fool you in any way. That day of the Lord will not come until the turning away from God happens. And that day will not come until the Man of Evil[a] appears. He belongs to hell. ", "4": "He is against any so-called god or anything that people worship. And the Man of Evil puts himself above anything called God or anything that people worship. And that Man of Evil even goes into God's Temple and sits there. Then he says that he is God.", "5": "I told you when I was with you that all this would happen. Do you not remember? ", "6": "And you know what is stopping that Man of Evil now. He is being stopped now so that he will appear at the right time. ", "7": "The secret power of evil is already working in the world now. But there is one who is stopping that power. And he will continue to stop it until he is taken out of the way. ", "8": "Then that Man of Evil will appear. And the Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath that comes from his mouth and will destroy him with the glory of his coming. ", "9": "The Man of Evil will come by the power of Satan. He will have great power, and he will do many different false miracles, signs, and wonders. ", "10": "He will use every kind of evil to trick those who are lost. They are lost because they refused to love the truth. (If they loved the truth, they would be saved.) ", "11": "But they refused to love the truth; so God sends them something powerful that leads them away from the truth. He sends them that power so they will believe something that is not true. ", "12": "So all those who do not believe the truth will be judged guilty. They did not believe the truth, and they enjoyed doing evil.", "13": "Brothers, the Lord loves you. God chose you from the beginning[b] to be saved. So we must always thank God for you. You are saved by the Spirit that makes you holy and by your faith in the truth. ", "14": "God used the Good News that we preached to call you to be saved. He called you so that you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. ", "15": "So, brothers, stand strong and continue to believe the teachings we gave you. We taught you those things in our speaking and in our letter to you.", "16-17": "We pray that the Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father will comfort you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say. God loved us. Through his grace he gave us a good hope and comfort that continues forever."}

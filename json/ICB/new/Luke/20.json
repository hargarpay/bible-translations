Tell me: ", "4": "When John baptized people, did that come from God or from man?\u201d", "5": "The priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish leaders all talked about this. They said to each other, \u201cIf we answer, 'John's baptism was from God,' then Jesus will say, 'Then why did you not believe John?'

They are children of God, because they have been raised from death. ", "37": "Moses clearly showed that the dead are raised to life.

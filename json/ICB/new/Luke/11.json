And do not cause us to be tested.'\u201d[a]", "5-6": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cSuppose one of you went to your friend's house at midnight and said to him, 'A friend of mine has come into town to visit me.

I cannot get up and give you the bread now.' ", "8": "I tell you, maybe friendship is not enough to make him get up to give you the bread.

The same One who made what is outside also made what is inside. ", "41": "So give what is in your cups and dishes to the poor. Then you will be fully clean.

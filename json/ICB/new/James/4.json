So you are ready to kill and are jealous of other people. But you still cannot get what you want. So you argue and fight. You do not get what you want because you do not ask God. ", "3": "Or when you ask, you do not receive because the reason you ask is wrong. You want things only so that you can use them for your own pleasures.", "4": "So, you people are not loyal to God!

It says, \u201cThe Spirit that God made to live in us wants us for himself alone.\u201d[a] ", "6": "But God gives us even more grace, as the Scripture says, \u201cGod is against the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.\u201d Proverbs 3:34", "7": "So give yourselves to God.

He is the only One who can save and destroy. So it is not right for you to judge your neighbor.", "13": "Some of you say, \u201cToday or tomorrow we will go to some city. We will stay there a year, do business, and make money.\u201d ", "14": "But you do not know what will happen tomorrow! Your life is like a mist. You can see it for a short time, but then it goes away. ", "15": "So you should say, \u201cIf the Lord wants, we will live and do this or that.\u201d ", "16": "But now you are proud and you brag.

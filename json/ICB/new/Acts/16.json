His father was a Greek.", "2": "The brothers in Lystra and Iconium respected Timothy and said good things about him. ", "3": "Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him. But all the Jews living in that area knew that Timothy's father was Greek. So Paul circumcised Timothy to please the Jews. ", "4": "Paul and the men with him traveled from town to town. They gave the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. ", "5": "So the churches became stronger in the faith and grew larger every day.", "6": "Paul and the men with him went through the areas of Phrygia and Galatia. The Holy Spirit did not let them preach the Good News in Asia. ", "7": "When they came near the country of Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit of Jesus did not let them. ", "8": "So they passed by Mysia and went to Troas. ", "9": "That night Paul had a vision. In the vision, a man from Macedonia came to him. The man stood there and begged, \u201cCome over to Macedonia. Help us!\u201d ", "10": "After Paul had seen the vision, we immediately prepared to leave for Macedonia. We understood that God had called us to tell the Good News to those people.", "11": "We left Troas in a ship, and we sailed straight to the island of Samothrace. The next day we sailed to Neapolis.[a] ", "12": "Then we went by land to Philippi, the leading city in that part of Macedonia. It is also a Roman colony.[b] We stayed there for several days.", "13": "On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the river. There we thought we would find a special place for prayer.

The Lord opened her mind to pay attention to what Paul was saying. ", "15": "She and all the people in her house were baptized. Then Lydia invited us to her home. She said, \u201cIf you think I am truly a believer in the Lord, then come stay in my house.\u201d And she persuaded us to stay with her.", "16": "Once, while we were going to the place for prayer, a servant girl met us. She had a special spirit[c] in her. She earned a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes. ", "17": "This girl followed Paul and us. She said loudly, \u201cThese men are servants of the Most High God! They are telling you how you can be saved!\u201d", "18": "She kept this up for many days. This bothered Paul, so he turned and said to the spirit, \u201cBy the power of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!\u201d Immediately, the spirit came out.", "19": "The owners of the servant girl saw this. These men knew that now they could not use her to make money. So they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the city rulers in the marketplace. ", "20": "Here they brought Paul and Silas to the Roman rulers and said, \u201cThese men are Jews and are making trouble in our city. ", "21": "They are teaching things that are not right for us as Romans to do.\u201d", "22": "The crowd joined the attack against them.

", "27": "The jailer woke up and saw that the jail doors were open. He thought that the prisoners had already escaped. So he got his sword and was about to kill himself.[d] ", "28": "But Paul shouted, \u201cDon't hurt yourself! We are all here!\u201d", "29": "The jailer told someone to bring a light. Then he ran inside. Shaking with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas. ", "30": "Then he brought them outside and said, \u201cMen, what must I do to be saved?\u201d", "31": "They said to him, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved\u2014you and all the people in your house.\u201d ", "32": "So Paul and Silas told the message of the Lord to the jailer and all the people in his house. ", "33": "At that hour of the night the jailer took Paul and Silas and washed their wounds. Then he and all his people were baptized immediately. ", "34": "After this the jailer took Paul and Silas home and gave them food. He and his family were very happy because they now believed in God.", "35": "The next morning, the Roman officers sent the police to tell the jailer, \u201cLet these men go free!\u201d", "36": "The jailer said to Paul, \u201cThe officers have sent an order to let you go free. You can leave now. Go in peace.\u201d", "37": "But Paul said to the police, \u201cThey beat us in public without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens.[e] And they threw us in jail. Now they want to make us go away quietly. No! Let them come themselves and bring us out!\u201d", "38": "The police told the Roman officers what Paul said. When the officers heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid. ", "39": "So they came and told Paul and Silas they were sorry. They took Paul and Silas out of jail and asked them to leave the city. ", "40": "So when they came out of the jail, they went to Lydia's house. There they saw some of the believers and encouraged them. Then they left."}

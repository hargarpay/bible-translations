", "20": "Get up and go downstairs. Go with them and don't ask questions. I have sent them to you.\u201d", "21": "So Peter went down to the men. He said, \u201cI am the man you are looking for. Why did you come here?\u201d", "22": "They said, \u201cA holy angel spoke to Cornelius, an army officer. He is a good man; he worships God. All the Jewish people respect him. The angel told Cornelius to ask you to his house so that he can hear what you have to say.\u201d ", "23": "Peter asked the men to come in and spend the night.

", "28": "He said, \u201cYou people understand that it is against our Jewish law for a Jew to associate with or visit anyone who is not a Jew. But God has shown me that I should not call any person 'unholy' or 'unclean.' ", "29": "That is why I did not argue when I was asked to come here. Now, please tell me why you sent for me.\u201d", "30": "Cornelius said, \u201cFour days ago, I was praying in my house. It was at this same time\u2014three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly, there was a man standing before me wearing shining clothes. ", "31": "He said, 'Cornelius! God has heard your prayer. He has seen what you give to the poor. And God remembers you. ", "32": "So send some men to Joppa and ask Simon Peter to come. Peter is staying in the house of a man, also named Simon, who is a leatherworker. His house is beside the sea.' ", "33": "So I sent for you immediately, and it was very good of you to come. Now we are all here before God to hear everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\u201d", "34": "Peter began to speak: \u201cI really understand now that to God every person is the same. ", "35": "God accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right. It is not important what country a person comes from. ", "36": "You know that God has sent his message to the people of Israel. That message is the Good News that peace has come through Jesus Christ. Jesus is the Lord of all people! ", "37": "You know what has happened all over Judea.

", "42": "He told us to preach to the people and to tell them that he is the one whom God chose to be the judge of the living and the dead. ", "43": "Everyone who believes in Jesus will be forgiven. God will forgive his sins through Jesus. All the prophets say this is true.\u201d", "44": "While Peter was still saying this, the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening. ", "45": "The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been given even to the non-Jewish people. ", "46": "These Jewish believers heard them speaking in different languages and praising God. Then Peter said, ", "47": "\u201cCan anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we did!\u201d ", "48": "So Peter ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days."}

{"1": "Later, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. ", "2": "Here he met a Jew named Aquila. Aquila was born in the country of Pontus. But Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, had recently moved to Corinth from Italy. They left Italy because Claudius[a] commanded that all Jews must leave Rome. Paul went to visit Aquila and Priscilla. ", "3": "They were tentmakers, just as he was. He stayed with them and worked with them. ", "4": "Every Sabbath day he talked with the Jews and Greeks in the synagogue. Paul tried to persuade these people to believe in Jesus.", "5": "Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia and joined Paul in Corinth. After this, Paul used all his time telling people the Good News. He showed the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. ", "6": "But they would not accept Paul's teaching and said some evil things. So he shook off the dust from his clothes.[b] He said to them, \u201cIf you are not saved, it will be your own fault! I have done all I can do! After this, I will go to non-Jewish people!\u201d ", "7": "Paul left the synagogue and moved into the home of Titius Justus. It was next to the synagogue. This man worshiped the true God. ", "8": "Crispus was the leader of that synagogue. He and all the people living in his house believed in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also listened to Paul. They too believed and were baptized.", "9": "During the night, Paul had a vision. The Lord said to him, \u201cDon't be afraid! Continue talking to people and don't be quiet! ", "10": "I am with you. No one will hurt you because many of my people are in this city.\u201d ", "11": "Paul stayed there for a year and a half, teaching God's word to the people.", "12": "Gallio became the governor of the country of Southern Greece. At that time, some of the Jews came together against Paul and took him to the court. ", "13": "They said to Gallio, \u201cThis man is teaching people to worship God in a way that is against our law!\u201d", "14": "Paul was about to say something, but Gallio spoke to the Jews. Gallio said, \u201cI would listen to you Jews if you were complaining about a crime or some wrong. ", "15": "But the things you are saying are only questions about words and names\u2014arguments about your own law. So you must solve this problem yourselves. I don't want to be a judge of these things!\u201d ", "16": "Then Gallio made them leave the court.", "17": "Then they all grabbed Sosthenes. (Sosthenes was now the leader of the synagogue.) They beat him there before the court. But this did not bother Gallio.", "18": "Paul stayed with the believers for many more days. Then he left and sailed for Syria. Priscilla and Aquila went with him. At Cenchrea, Paul cut off his hair.[c] This showed that he had made a promise to God. ", "19": "Then they went to Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. While Paul was there, he went into the synagogue and talked with the Jews. ", "20": "When they asked him to stay with them longer, he refused.

He traveled from town to town in these countries, giving strength to all the followers.", "24": "A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was born in the city of Alexandria. He was an educated man who knew the Scriptures well. ", "25": "He had been taught about the Lord. He was always very excited when he spoke and taught the truth about Jesus. But the only baptism that Apollos knew about was the baptism that John[d] taught. ", "26": "Apollos began to speak very boldly in the synagogue, and Priscilla and Aquila heard him. So they took him to their home and helped him better understand the way of God. ", "27": "Now Apollos wanted to go to the country of Southern Greece, so the believers helped him. They wrote a letter to the followers there, asking them to accept him. These followers had believed in Jesus because of God's grace. When Apollos went there, he helped them very much. ", "28": "He argued very strongly with the Jews before all the people. Apollos clearly proved that the Jews were wrong. Using the Scriptures, he proved that Jesus is the Christ."}

The worshipers would be made clean, and they would no longer feel guilty for their sins. ", "3": "These sacrifices remind them of their sins every year, ", "4": "because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.", "5": "So when Christ came into the world, he said: \u201cYou do not want sacrifices and offerings.

And because of this, we are made holy through the sacrifice of his body. Christ made this sacrifice only once, and for all time.", "11": "Every day the priests stand and do their religious service. Again and again they offer the same sacrifices. But those sacrifices can never take away sins. ", "12": "But Christ offered one sacrifice for sins, and it is good forever.

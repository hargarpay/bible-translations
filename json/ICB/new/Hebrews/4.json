", "2": "The Good News was preached to us just as it was to them. But the teaching they heard did not help them. They heard it but did not accept it with faith.[a] ", "3": "We who have believed are able to enter and have God's rest. As God has said, \u201cSo I was angry and made a promise. 'They will never enter my land of rest.'\u201d Psalm 95:11 But God's work was finished from the time he made the world. ", "4": "Somewhere in the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week: \u201cAnd on the seventh day God rested from all his work.\u201d[b] ", "5": "And again in the Scripture God said, \u201cThey will never enter my land of rest.\u201d", "6": "It is still true that some people will enter and have God's rest. But those who first heard the way to be saved did not enter. They did not enter because they did not obey. ", "7": "So God planned another day, called \u201ctoday.\u201d He spoke about that day through David a long time later. It is the same Scripture used before: \u201cToday listen to what he says. Do not be stubborn.\u201d Psalm 95:7-8", "8": "We know that Joshua[c] did not lead the people into that rest. We know this because God spoke later about another day.

Here there is grace. And we can receive mercy and grace to help us when we need it."}

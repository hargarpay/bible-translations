And anyone who did not follow it or obey it received the punishment he earned. ", "3": "The salvation that was given to us is very great. So surely we also will be punished if we live as if this salvation were not important. It was the Lord himself who first told about this salvation. And those who heard him proved to us that this salvation is true. ", "4": "God also proved it by using wonders, great signs, and many kinds of miracles. And he proved it by giving people gifts through the Holy Spirit, just as he wanted.", "5": "God did not choose angels to be the rulers of the new world that was coming. It is that future world we have been talking about. ", "6": "It is written somewhere in the Scriptures, \u201cWhy is man important to you? Why do you take care of the son of man?[a]", "7": "For a short time you made him lower than the angels. But you crowned him with glory and honor.", "8": "You put all things under his control.\u201d Psalm 8:4-6 If God put everything under his control, there was nothing left that he did not rule. But we do not yet see him ruling over everything. ", "9": "But we see Jesus! For a short time he was made lower than the angels. But now we see him wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died. Because of God's grace, he died for everyone.", "10": "God is the One who made all things.

I will praise you when your people meet to worship you.\u201d Psalm 22:22", "13": "He also says, \u201cI will trust in God.\u201d Isaiah 8:17 And he also says, \u201cI am here. And with me are the children that God has given me.\u201d Isaiah 8:18", "14": "These children are people with physical bodies.

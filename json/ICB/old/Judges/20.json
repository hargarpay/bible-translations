They had set it up near Gibeah. ", "37": "The men in hiding rushed into Gibeah. They spread out and killed everyone in the city with their swords. ", "38": "Now the men of Israel had made a plan with the men in hiding. The men in the surprise attack were to send up a signal. It was to be a big cloud of smoke from the city.

They were saying, \u201cWe are winning, as in the first battle!\u201d ", "40": "But then the big cloud of smoke began to rise from the city. The Benjaminites turned around and saw it. The whole city was full of smoke that went up into the sky. ", "41": "Then the Israelites turned and began to fight. The Benjaminites were terrified. Now they knew that disaster was coming to them.

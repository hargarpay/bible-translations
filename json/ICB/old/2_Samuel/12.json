{"1": "The Lord sent Nathan to David. When Nathan came to David, Nathan said, \u201cThere were two men in a city. One man was rich, but the other was poor. ", "2": "The rich man had very many sheep and cattle. ", "3": "But the poor man had nothing except one little female lamb he had bought. The poor man fed the lamb. It grew up with him and his children. It shared his food and drank from his cup. It slept in his arms. The lamb was like a daughter to him.", "4": "\u201cThen a traveler stopped to visit the rich man. The rich man wanted to give food to the traveler. But he didn't want to take one of his own sheep or cattle to feed the traveler. Instead, he took the lamb from the poor man. The rich man killed the lamb and cooked it for his visitor.\u201d", "5": "David became very angry at the rich man. He said to Nathan, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this should die! ", "6": "He must pay for the lamb four times for doing such a thing. He had no mercy!\u201d", "7": "Then Nathan said to David, \u201cYou are the man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I appointed you king of Israel. I saved you from Saul. ", "8": "I gave you his kingdom and his wives. And I made you king of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you even more. ", "9": "So why did you ignore the Lord's command? Why did you do what he says is wrong? You killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites! And you took his wife to become your wife! ", "10": "So there will always be people in your family who will be killed by a sword. This is because you showed that you did not respect me! And you took the wife of Uriah the Hittite!'", "11": "\u201cThis is what the Lord says: 'I am bringing trouble to you from your own family. While you watch, I will take your wives from you. And I will give them to someone who is very close to you. He will have physical relations with your wives, and everyone will know it. ", "12": "You had physical relations with Bathsheba in secret. But I will do this so all the people of Israel can see it.'\u201d", "13": "Then David said to Nathan, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord.\u201d Nathan answered, \u201cThe Lord has taken away your sin. You will not die. ", "14": "But what you did caused the Lord's enemies to lose all respect for him. For this reason the son who was born to you will die.\u201d", "15": "Then Nathan went home. And the Lord caused the son of David and Bathsheba, Uriah's widow, to become very sick. ", "16": "David prayed to God for the baby. David refused to eat or drink. He went into his house and stayed there. He lay on the ground all night. ", "17": "The elders of David's family came to him. They tried to pull him up from the ground. But he refused to get up. And he refused to eat food with them.", "18": "On the seventh day the baby died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the baby was dead. They said, \u201cLook, we tried to talk to David while the baby was alive. But he refused to listen to us. If we tell him the baby is dead, he may harm himself.\u201d", "19": "But David saw his servants whispering. Then he understood that the baby was dead. So he asked them, \u201cIs the baby dead?\u201d They answered, \u201cYes, he is dead.\u201d", "20": "Then David got up from the floor. He washed himself, put lotions on himself and changed his clothes. Then he went into the Lord's house to worship. After that, he went home and asked for something to eat. His servants gave him some food, and he ate.", "21": "David's servants said to him, \u201cWhy are you doing this? When the baby was still alive, you refused to eat. You cried. But when the baby died, you got up and ate food.\u201d", "22": "David said, \u201cWhile the baby was still alive, I refused to eat, and I cried. I thought, 'Who knows? Maybe the Lord will feel sorry for me and let the baby live.' ", "23": "But now the baby is dead. So why should I go without food? I can't bring him back to life. Some day I will go to him. But he cannot come back to me.\u201d", "24": "Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife. He slept with her and had intimate relations with her. She became pregnant again and had another son. David named the boy Solomon. The Lord loved Solomon. ", "25": "The Lord sent word through Nathan the prophet to name the baby Jedidiah.[a] This was because the Lord loved the child.", "26": "Now Joab fought against Rabbah, a city of the Ammonites. And he was about to capture the royal city. ", "27": "Joab sent messengers to David and said, \u201cI have fought against Rabbah. I have captured its water supply. ", "28": "Now bring the other soldiers together and attack this city. Capture it before I capture it myself. If I capture this city, it will be called by my name!\u201d", "29": "So David gathered all the army and went to Rabbah. He fought against Rabbah and captured it. ", "30": "David took the crown off their king's head. It was gold and weighed about 75 pounds. It also had gems in it. They put the crown on David's head. And David took many valuable things out of the city. ", "31": "He also brought out the people of the city. He made them work with saws, iron picks and axes. He also forced them to build with bricks. David did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his army went back to Jerusalem."}

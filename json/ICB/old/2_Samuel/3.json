Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, \u201cWhy did you have physical relations with my father's slave woman?\u201d", "8": "Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said. Abner said, \u201cI have been loyal to Saul and his family and friends! I didn't hand you over to David. I am not a traitor working for Judah! But now you are saying I did something wrong with this woman! ", "9": "May God punish me terribly if I don't help David. I will make sure that what God promised does happen!

I will make an agreement with you. But I ask you one thing. I will not meet with you unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal to me.\u201d ", "14": "Then David sent messengers to Saul's son Ish-Bosheth. David said, \u201cGive me my wife Michal. She was promised to me. I killed 100 Philistines to get her.\u201d", "15": "So Ish-Bosheth sent men to take Michal from her husband. He was Paltiel son of Laish.

", "27": "When Abner arrived at Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway. Joab acted as though he wanted to talk with him in private. But Joab stabbed Abner in the stomach, and Abner died. Abner had killed Joab's brother Asahel. So Joab killed Abner to pay him back.", "28": "Later David heard the news. He said, \u201cMy kingdom and I are innocent forever. We did not kill Abner son of Ner. The Lord knows this. ", "29": "Joab and his family are responsible for this. I hope many troubles will come to his family. May his family always have someone with sores or with a harmful skin disease. May they always have someone who must lean on a crutch. May some of his family be killed in war. May they always have someone without food to eat.\u201d", "30": "(Joab and his brother Abishai had killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel.

David and all the people cried at Abner's grave.", "33": "King David sang this funeral song for Abner. \u201cDid Abner die like a foolish man?", "34": "His hands were not tied. His feet were not in chains. He fell as a person falls before evil men.\u201d Then all the people cried again for Abner. ", "35": "They came to encourage David to eat while it was still day. But he made a promise. He said, \u201cMay God punish me terribly if I eat bread or any other food before the sun sets!\u201d", "36": "All the people saw what happened. They agreed with what the king was doing. ", "37": "That day all the people of Judah and all the Israelites understood. They knew it was not David who had killed Abner son of Ner.", "38": "David said to his officers, \u201cYou know that a very important leader died today in Israel. ", "39": "Even though I am the appointed king, I am weak today. These sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the Lord give them the punishment they should have.\u201d"}

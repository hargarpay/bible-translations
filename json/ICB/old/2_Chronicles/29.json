{"1": "Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king. And he ruled 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. ", "2": "Hezekiah did what the Lord said was right. He did just as his ancestor David had done.", "3": "Hezekiah opened the doors of the Temple of the Lord and repaired them. He did this in the first month of the first year he was king. ", "4": "Hezekiah brought the priests and Levites together in a group. He met with them in the courtyard on the east side of the Temple. ", "5": "Hezekiah said, \u201cListen to me, Levites! Make yourselves ready for the Lord's service. And make the Temple of the Lord holy. He is the God your ancestors obeyed. Remove from the Temple the things that make it impure. ", "6": "Our ancestors were unfaithful to God. They did what the Lord said was wrong. They left the Lord. They stopped worshiping at the Temple where he lives. They rejected him. ", "7": "They shut the doors of the porch of the Temple. They let the fire go out in the lamps. They stopped burning incense and offering burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. ", "8": "So the Lord became very angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem. And he punished them. Other peoples are frightened and shocked by what the Lord did to Judah and Jerusalem. They insult the people of Judah. You know these things are true. ", "9": "That is why our ancestors were killed in battle. That is why our sons, daughters and wives were taken prisoner. ", "10": "So now I, Hezekiah, have decided to make an agreement with the Lord, the God of Israel. Then he will not be angry with us anymore. ", "11": "My sons, don't waste any more time. The Lord chose you to serve him. You should serve him and burn incense to him.\u201d", "12": "These are the Levites who started to work. From the Kohathite family there were Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah. From the Merarite family there were Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel. From the Gershonite family there were Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah. ", "13": "From Elizaphan's family there were Shimri and Jeiel. From Asaph's family there were Zechariah and Mattaniah. ", "14": "From Heman's family there were Jehiel and Shimei. From Jeduthun's family there were Shemaiah and Uzziel.", "15": "These Levites gathered their brothers together. Then they made themselves holy for service in the Temple. They obeyed the king's command that had come from the Lord. They went into the Temple of the Lord to purify it. ", "16": "The priests went into the Temple of the Lord to purify it. They took out all the unclean things they found in the Temple of the Lord. And they put them in the Temple courtyard. Then the Levites took these things out to the Kidron Valley. ", "17": "They made the Temple holy for the Lord's service. They began on the first day of the first month. On the eighth day of the month, they came to the porch of the Temple. For eight more days they made the Temple of the Lord holy. They finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.", "18": "Then they went to King Hezekiah. They said to him, \u201cWe have purified all the Temple of the Lord. We have purified the altar for burnt offerings and its things. We have purified the table for the holy bread and all its things. ", "19": "When Ahaz was king, he was unfaithful to God. He removed some things from the Temple. But we have put them back and made them holy for the Lord. They are now in front of the Lord's altar.\u201d", "20": "Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the leaders of the city. They went up to the Temple of the Lord. ", "21": "They brought seven bulls, seven male sheep, seven male lambs and seven male goats. These animals were an offering to remove the sin of the people and the kingdom of Judah. And this offering made the Temple ready for service to God. King Hezekiah commanded the priests to offer these animals on the Lord's altar. The priests were from the family of Aaron. ", "22": "So the priests killed the bulls. Then they sprinkled the bulls' blood on the altar. They killed the male sheep and sprinkled their blood on the altar. Then they killed the lambs. And they sprinkled the lambs' blood on the altar. ", "23": "Then the priests brought the male goats before the king and the people there. The goats were for the sin offering. The king and the people put their hands on the goats. ", "24": "Then the priests killed the goats. They made a sin offering with the goats' blood on the altar. They did this to remove the sins of the Israelites so they would belong to the Lord. The king had said that the burnt offering and sin offering should be made for all Israel.", "25": "King Hezekiah put the Levites in the Temple of the Lord with cymbals, harps and lyres. He did this as David, Gad and Nathan had commanded. (Gad was the king's seer, and Nathan was a prophet.) This command came from the Lord through his prophets. ", "26": "So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments of music. And the priests stood ready with their trumpets.", "27": "Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the singing to the Lord also began. The trumpets were blown. And the musical instruments of David king of Israel were played. ", "28": "All the people worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpet players blew their trumpets. They did this until the burnt offering was finished.", "29": "When the sacrifices were finished, King Hezekiah and everyone with him bowed down and worshiped. ", "30": "King Hezekiah and his officers ordered the Levites to praise the Lord. They were to use the words David and Asaph the seer used. They praised God with joy. And they bowed down and worshiped.", "31": "Then Hezekiah said, \u201cNow you people of Judah have given yourselves to the Lord. Come near to the Temple of the Lord. Bring sacrifices and offerings to show thanks to the Lord.\u201d So the people brought sacrifices and offerings to show thanks to the Lord. Anyone who wanted to also brought burnt offerings. ", "32": "For burnt offerings they brought a total of 70 bulls, 100 male sheep and 200 lambs. All these animals were sacrificed as burnt offerings to the Lord. ", "33": "The offerings made holy for the Lord totaled 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep and goats. ", "34": "There were not enough priests to skin all the animals for the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them. They helped until the work was finished and other priests could be made holy for the Lord's service. The Levites had been more careful to make themselves holy for the Lord's service than the priests. ", "35": "There were many burnt offerings. With them were the fat of fellowship offerings and drink offerings. So the service in the Temple of the Lord began again. ", "36": "And Hezekiah and the people were very happy. They were happy that God had made it happen so quickly for his people."}

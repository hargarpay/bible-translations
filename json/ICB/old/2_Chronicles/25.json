Each person must die for his own sins.\u201d[a]", "5": "Amaziah gathered the people of Judah together. He grouped all the people of Judah and Benjamin by families.

It walked on and crushed the thornbush. ", "19": "You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom. You are proud, and you brag. But you stay at home! Don't ask for trouble by fighting me. If you do, you and Judah will be defeated.\u201d", "20": "But Amaziah would not listen. God caused this to happen. He planned to let Jehoash of Israel defeat Judah.

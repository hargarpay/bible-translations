{"1": "The wife of a man from a group of the prophets came to Elisha. She said, \u201cYour servant, my husband, is dead! You know he honored the Lord. But now the man he owes money to is coming to take my two boys. He will make them his slaves!\u201d", "2": "Elisha answered, \u201cHow can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?\u201d The woman said, \u201cI don't have anything there except a pot of oil.\u201d", "3": "Then Elisha said, \u201cGo and get empty jars from all your neighbors. Don't ask for just a few. ", "4": "Then you must go into your house and close the door. Only you and your sons will be there. Then pour oil into all the jars. Set the full ones to one side.\u201d", "5": "She left Elisha and shut the door. Only she and her sons were in the house. As they brought the jars to her, she poured the oil. ", "6": "When the jars were all full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another jar.\u201d But he said, \u201cThere are no more jars.\u201d Then the oil stopped flowing.", "7": "She went and told Elisha. Elisha said to her, \u201cGo. Sell the oil and pay what you owe. You and your sons can live on what is left.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha went to Shunem. An important woman lived there. She begged Elisha to stay and eat. So every time Elisha passed by, he stopped there to eat. ", "9": "The woman said to her husband, \u201cI know that Elisha is a holy man of God. He passes by our house all the time. ", "10": "Let's make a small room on the roof.[a] Let's put a bed in the room for Elisha. And we can put a table, a chair and a lampstand there. Then when he comes by, he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "One day Elisha came to the woman's house. He went to his room and rested. ", "12": "He said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cCall the Shunammite.\u201d When the servant called her, she stood in front of him. ", "13": "Elisha told his servant, \u201cNow say to her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak to the king or the commander of the army for you?'\u201d The woman answered, \u201cI live among my own people.\u201d", "14": "Elisha said, \u201cBut what can we do for her?\u201d Gehazi answered, \u201cShe has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "Then Elisha said, \u201cCall her.\u201d So he called her, and she stood in the doorway. ", "16": "Then Elisha said, \u201cAbout this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.\u201d The woman said, \u201cNo, master, man of God. Don't lie to me!\u201d", "17": "But the woman became pregnant. And she gave birth to a son at that time the next year as Elisha had told her.", "18": "The child grew. One day he went out to his father, who was with the men harvesting grain. ", "19": "The boy said to his father, \u201cMy head! My head!\u201d The father said to his servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother!\u201d ", "20": "The servant took him to his mother. He lay on his mother's lap until noon. Then he died. ", "21": "She took him up and laid him on Elisha's bed. Then she shut the door and went out.", "22": "She called to her husband. She said, \u201cSend me one of the servants and one of the donkeys. Then I can go quickly to the man of God and come back.\u201d", "23": "The woman's husband said, \u201cWhy do you want to go to him today? It isn't the New Moon or the Sabbath day.\u201d She said, \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d", "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \u201cLead on. Don't slow down for me unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "So she went to Elisha at Mount Carmel. He saw her coming from far away. So he said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook, there's the Shunammite woman! ", "26": "Run to meet her! Say to her, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?'\u201d She answered, \u201cEverything is all right.\u201d", "27": "Then she came to Elisha at the hill. She caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to pull her away. But Elisha said to him, \u201cLet her alone. She's very upset, and the Lord has not told me about it. He has hidden it from me.\u201d", "28": "She said, \u201cMaster, I didn't tell you I wanted a son. I told you, 'Don't fool me.'\u201d", "29": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cGet ready. Take my walking stick in your hand and go quickly. If you meet anyone, don't greet him. If anyone greets you, don't answer him. Lay my walking stick on the face of the boy.\u201d", "30": "But the child's mother said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I won't leave you!\u201d So he got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi went on ahead. He laid the walking stick on the child's face. But the child did not talk or move. Then Gehazi went back to meet Elisha. He told Elisha, \u201cThe child has not awakened.\u201d", "32": "Elisha came into the house. There was the child, lying dead on his bed. ", "33": "When Elisha entered the room, he shut the door. Only he and the child were in the room. Then Elisha prayed to the Lord. ", "34": "He went to the bed and lay on the child. He put his mouth on the child's mouth. He put his eyes on the child's eyes and his hands on the child's hands. He stretched himself out on top of the child. Then the child's skin became warm. ", "35": "Elisha turned away and walked around the room. Then he went back and put himself on the child again. Then the child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.", "36": "Elisha called Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite!\u201d And he did. When she came, Elisha said, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came in and fell at Elisha's feet. She bowed facedown to the floor. Then she picked up her son and went out.", "38": "Elisha came to Gilgal again. There was a time of hunger in the land. A group of prophets was sitting in front of him. He said to his servant, \u201cPut the large pot on the fire. Boil some stew for these men.\u201d", "39": "One of them went out into the field to gather plants. He found a wild vine. He picked fruit from the vine and filled his robe with it. Then he came and cut up the fruit into the pot. But they did not know what kind of fruit it was. ", "40": "Then they poured out the stew for the men to eat. But when they began to eat it, they shouted out, \u201cMan of God! There's death in the pot!\u201d They could not eat it.", "41": "Elisha told them to bring some flour. Then he threw it into the pot. He said, \u201cPour it out for the people to eat.\u201d And there was nothing harmful in the pot.", "42": "A man from Baal Shalishah came to Elisha. He brought 20 loaves of barley bread from the first harvest to Elisha. He also brought fresh grain in his sack. Then Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people to eat.\u201d", "43": "Elisha's servant said, \u201cHow can I feed 100 men with so little?\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cGive the bread to the people to eat. This is what the Lord says: 'They will eat and will have food left over.'\u201d ", "44": "Then he gave it to them. The people ate and had food left over, as the Lord had said."}

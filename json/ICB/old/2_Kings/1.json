He sent messengers and told them, \u201cGo. Ask Baal-Zebub god of Ekron if I will get well from my injuries.\u201d", "3": "But the Lord's angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, \u201cGet up. Go meet the messengers sent by the king of Samaria. Say to them, 'Why are you going to ask questions of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel?' ", "4": "So this is what the Lord says: 'You will not get up from the bed you are lying on. You will die.'\u201d Then Elijah left.", "5": "The messengers came back to Ahaziah. He asked them, \u201cWhy have you come back?\u201d", "6": "They said, \u201cA man came to meet us. He said, 'Go back to the king who sent you. Tell him what the Lord says: \u201cWhy do you send men to ask questions of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel? This is why you will not get up from your bed. You will die.\u201d'\u201d", "7": "Ahaziah asked them, \u201cWhat did the man look like who met you and told you this?\u201d", "8": "They answered, \u201cHe wore a hairy coat and a leather belt around his waist.\u201d Ahaziah said, \u201cIt was Elijah the Tishbite.\u201d", "9": "Then he sent a captain with his 50 men to Elijah. The captain went to Elijah, who was sitting on top of the hill. He said to Elijah, \u201cMan of God, the king says, 'Come down!'\u201d", "10": "Elijah answered the captain, \u201cI am a man of God. So let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your 50 men.\u201d Then fire came down from heaven. It burned up the captain and his 50 men.", "11": "Ahaziah sent another captain and 50 men to Elijah. The captain said to him, \u201cMan of God, this is what the king says: 'Come down quickly!'\u201d", "12": "Elijah answered, \u201cI am a man of God. So let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your 50 men!\u201d Then fire came down from heaven.

You will die.'\u201d ", "17": "So he died, just as the Lord, through Elijah, had said he would. Joram became king in Ahaziah's place.

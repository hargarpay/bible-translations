But he was not like his father and mother. He removed the stone pillars his father had made for Baal. ", "3": "But he continued to do the same sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had caused the people of Israel to sin. And Joram did not stop doing these same sins.", "4": "Mesha king of Moab raised sheep. He had to give 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 male sheep to the king of Israel. ", "5": "But when Ahab died, the king of Moab turned against the king of Israel.

Will you go with me against Moab in battle?\u201d Jehoshaphat said, \u201cI will go with you. I am ready to join you. My soldiers and my horses are ready to join with your army.\u201d", "8": "Jehoshaphat asked, \u201cWhich way should we go to attack?\u201d Joram answered, \u201cThrough the Desert of Edom.\u201d", "9": "So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They marched seven days. There was no more water for the army or for their animals that were with them. ", "10": "The king of Israel said, \u201cHow terrible this is!

Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother!\u201d The king of Israel said to Elisha, \u201cNo. The Lord has called us three kings together to let the Moabites defeat us.\u201d", "14": "Elisha said, \u201cI serve the Lord of heaven's armies. As surely as he lives, I tell you the truth. I wouldn't even look at you or notice you if Jehoshaphat king of Judah were not here. I respect him!

It came from the direction of Edom and filled the valley.", "21": "All the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. They gathered everyone old enough to put on armor. And they waited at the border. ", "22": "But when the Moabites got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. They saw the water across from them. It looked as red as blood.

The Israelites went on into the land to fight the Moabites. ", "25": "They tore down the cities. They threw rocks on every good field and filled it. They stopped up all the springs of water. And they cut down all the good trees. Kir Hareseth was the only city with its stones still in place.

So he took 700 men with swords to break through to the king of Edom. But they could not break through. ", "27": "Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have become king after him. And he offered his son as a burnt offering on the wall. So there was great anger against the Israelites. They left and went back to their own land."}

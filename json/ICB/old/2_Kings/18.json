And he ruled 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. ", "3": "Hezekiah did what the Lord said was right. He did just as his ancestor David had done. ", "4": "He removed the places where false gods were worshiped. He broke the stone pillars they worshiped. He cut down the Asherah idols. Also the Israelites had been burning incense to the bronze snake made by Moses. (It was called Nehushtan.) But Hezekiah broke it into pieces.", "5": "Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah. There was no king like him, before him or after him. ", "6": "Hezekiah was loyal to the Lord. He did not stop following the Lord. He obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses. ", "7": "And the Lord was with Hezekiah. He had success in everything he did. He turned against the king of Assyria and stopped serving him.

And it was Hoshea's ninth year as king of Israel. ", "11": "The king of Assyria took the Israelites away to Assyria. He put them in Halah and in Gozan on the Habor River. He also put them in the cities of the Medes. ", "12": "This happened because they did not obey the Lord their God. They broke his agreement. They did not obey all that Moses, the Lord's servant, had commanded. They would not listen to the commands or do them.", "13": "During Hezekiah's fourteenth year as king, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked Judah. He attacked all the strong, walled cities of Judah and defeated them. ", "14": "Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish. He said, \u201cI have done wrong. Leave me alone. Then I will pay anything you demand of me.\u201d So the king of Assyria told Hezekiah how much to pay. It was about 22,000 pounds of silver and 2,000 pounds of gold.

", "20": "You say you have battle plans and power for war. But your words mean nothing. Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me? ", "21": "Look, you are depending on Egypt to help you. Egypt is like a splintered walking stick. If you lean on it for help, it will stab you and hurt you. The king of Egypt will hurt those who depend on him. ", "22": "You might say, \u201cWe are depending on the Lord our God.\u201d But Hezekiah destroyed the Lord's altars and the places of worship.

The Lord himself told me to come to this country and destroy it.'\u201d", "26": "Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna and Joah spoke to the field commander. They said, \u201cPlease speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew because the people on the city wall can hear you.\u201d", "27": "But the commander said, \u201cNo. My master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king. My master sent me to tell them also to those people sitting on the wall. They will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you.\u201d", "28": "Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language. He said, \u201cListen to the word from the great king, the king of Assyria! ", "29": "The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you. Hezekiah can't save you from my power.

Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? They did not save Samaria from my power. ", "35": "Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me. Then the Lord cannot save Jerusalem from my power.\u201d", "36": "The people were silent. They didn't answer the commander at all.

(Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager. Shebna was the royal assistant. And Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said."}

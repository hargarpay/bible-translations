{"1": "Elisha called a man from the group of the prophets. Elisha said, \u201cTighten your clothes around you. And take this small bottle of olive oil in your hand. Go to Ramoth in Gilead. ", "2": "When you arrive, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat is the son of Nimshi. Go in and make Jehu get up from among his brothers. Take him to an inner room. ", "3": "Take the bottle and pour the oil on Jehu's head. Say, 'This is what the Lord says: I have appointed you king over Israel.' Then open the door and run away. Don't wait!\u201d", "4": "So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth in Gilead. ", "5": "When he arrived, he saw the officers of the army sitting together. He said, \u201cCommander, I have a message for you.\u201d Jehu asked, \u201cFor which one of us?\u201d The young man said, \u201cFor you, commander.\u201d", "6": "Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head. He said to Jehu, \u201cThis is what the Lord of Israel says: 'I have appointed you king over the Lord's people, Israel. ", "7": "You must destroy the family of Ahab your master. I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants the prophets. And I will punish her for all the Lord's servants who were murdered. ", "8": "So all Ahab's family will die. I will not let any male child in Ahab's family live in Israel. It does not matter if he is a slave or a free person. ", "9": "I will make Ahab's family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat. They will be like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah. ", "10": "The dogs will eat Jezebel in the portion of land at Jezreel. And no one will bury her.'\u201d Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away.", "11": "Jehu went back to his master's officers. One of them said to Jehu, \u201cIs everything all right? Why did this crazy man come to you?\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cYou know the man and how he talks.\u201d", "12": "They answered, \u201cThat's not true! Tell us.\u201d Jehu said, \u201cHe said, 'This is what the Lord says: I have appointed you to be king over Israel.'\u201d", "13": "Then the officers hurried. Each man took off his own coat. They put them on the stairs for Jehu. Then they blew the trumpet. They said, \u201cJehu is king!\u201d", "14": "So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat made plans against Joram. (Jehoshaphat was the son of Nimshi.) Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth in Gilead from Hazael king of Aram. ", "15": "But King Joram had to return to Israel to heal from the injuries the Arameans had given him. He received these injuries when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, \u201cIf you agree with this, don't let anyone leave the city. They might tell the news in Jezreel.\u201d ", "16": "Then he got into his chariot and set out for Jezreel. Joram was resting there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.", "17": "The lookout was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu's troops coming. He said, \u201cI see some soldiers!\u201d Joram said, \u201cTake a horseman and send him to meet them. Tell him to ask, 'Do you bring good news?'\u201d", "18": "So the horseman rode out to meet Jehu. The horseman said, \u201cThis is what the king says: 'Do you bring good news?'\u201d Jehu said, \u201cThat's none of your business! Come along behind me.\u201d The lookout reported, \u201cThe messenger reached them. But he is not coming back.\u201d", "19": "So Joram sent out a second horseman. This rider came to Jehu's group and said, \u201cThis is what the king says: 'Do you bring good news?'\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cThat's none of your business! Come along behind me.\u201d", "20": "The lookout reported, \u201cThe second man reached them. But he is not coming back. The man in the chariot is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi. He drives as if he were crazy!\u201d", "21": "Joram said, \u201cGet my chariot ready.\u201d Then the servant got Joram's chariot ready. Joram and Ahaziah king of Judah went out. Each king went in his own chariot to meet Jehu. And they met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.", "22": "When Joram saw Jehu, he said, \u201cDo you bring good news, Jehu?\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cThere will never be any good news as long as your mother Jezebel worships idols and uses witchcraft.\u201d", "23": "Joram turned the horses to run away. He yelled to Ahaziah, \u201cIt's a trick, Ahaziah!\u201d", "24": "Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow went through Joram's heart. And he fell down in his chariot.", "25": "Jehu ordered Bidkar, his chariot officer, \u201cPick up Joram's body. Throw it into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I rode together with Joram's father Ahab. The Lord made this prophecy against him: ", "26": "'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons, says the Lord. So I will punish Ahab in his field, says the Lord.' So take Joram's body and throw it into the field, as the Lord has said.\u201d", "27": "When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he ran away toward Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, saying, \u201cShoot Ahaziah, too!\u201d Ahaziah was wounded in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam. Ahaziah got as far as Megiddo but died there. ", "28": "His servants carried his body in a chariot to Jerusalem. They buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in Jerusalem. ", "29": "(Ahaziah had become king over Judah in Joram's eleventh year as king. Joram was the son of Ahab.)", "30": "When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it. She put paint on her eyes and fixed her hair. Then she looked out the window. ", "31": "Jehu entered the city gate. And Jezebel said, \u201cHave you come in peace, you Zimri,[a] you who killed your master?\u201d", "32": "Jehu looked up at the window. He said, \u201cWho is on my side? Who?\u201d Two or three eunuchs looked out from the window at Jehu. ", "33": "Jehu said to them, \u201cThrow her down!\u201d So they threw Jezebel down. And the horses ran over her body. Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses.", "34": "Jehu went into the house and ate and drank. Then he said, \u201cNow see about this cursed woman. Bury her, because she is a king's daughter.\u201d", "35": "The men went to bury Jezebel. But they could not find her body. They could only find the skull, feet and palms of her hands. ", "36": "So they came back and told Jehu. Then Jehu said, \u201cThe Lord said this through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: 'The dogs will eat the body of Jezebel in the portion of land at Jezreel. ", "37": "Her body will be like manure on the field in the land at Jezreel. Then people cannot say that the body is Jezebel.'\u201d"}

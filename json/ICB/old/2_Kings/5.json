{"1": "Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man to his master. He had much honor because the Lord had used him to give victory to Aram. He was a mighty and brave man. But he had a harmful skin disease.", "2": "The Arameans had gone out to steal from the Israelites. And they had taken a little girl as a captive from Israel. This little girl served Naaman's wife. ", "3": "She said to her mistress, \u201cI wish that my master would meet the prophet who lives in Samaria. He would heal Naaman of his disease.\u201d", "4": "Naaman went to the king. He told him what the girl from Israel had said. ", "5": "The king of Aram said, \u201cGo now. And I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\u201d So Naaman left and took about 750 pounds of silver. He also took about 150 pounds of gold and ten changes of clothes with him. ", "6": "He brought the letter to the king of Israel. It read, \u201cI am sending my servant Naaman to you. I'm sending him so you can heal him of his skin disease.\u201d", "7": "The king of Israel read the letter. Then he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. He said, \u201cI'm not God! I can't kill and make alive again! Why does this man send someone with a harmful skin disease for me to heal? You can see that the king of Aram is trying to start trouble with me!\u201d", "8": "Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes. So he sent a message to the king. It said, \u201cWhy have you become so upset that you tore your clothes? Let Naaman come to me. Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel!\u201d ", "9": "So Naaman went with his horses and chariots to Elisha's house. And he stood outside the door.", "10": "Elisha sent a messenger to Naaman. The messenger said, \u201cGo and wash in the Jordan River seven times. Then your skin will be healed, and you will be clean.\u201d", "11": "Naaman became angry and left. He said, \u201cI thought Elisha would surely come out and stand before me. I thought he would call on the name of the Lord his God. I thought he would wave his hand over the place and heal the disease! ", "12": "Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, are better than all the waters of Israel! Why can't I wash in them and become clean?\u201d So Naaman went away very angry.", "13": "But Naaman's servants came near and talked to him. They said, \u201cMy father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? Doesn't it make more sense just to do it? After all, he only told you, 'Wash, and you will be clean.'\u201d ", "14": "So Naaman went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times. He did just as Elisha had said. Then Naaman's skin became new again. It was like the skin of a little boy. And Naaman was clean!", "15": "Naaman and all his group came back to Elisha. He stood before Elisha and said, \u201cLook. I now know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel! Now please accept a gift from me.\u201d", "16": "But Elisha said, \u201cI serve the Lord. As surely as the Lord lives, I won't accept anything.\u201d Naaman urged him to take the gift, but he refused.", "17": "Then Naaman said, \u201cIf you won't take the gift, then please give me some dirt. Give me as much as two of my mules can carry. From now on I'll not offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other gods. I'll only offer sacrifices to the Lord. ", "18": "But let the Lord pardon me for this: My master goes into the temple of Rimmon[a] to worship. When he goes, he will lean on my arm. Then I must bow in that temple. May the Lord pardon me when I do that.\u201d", "19": "Elisha said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d Naaman left Elisha and went a short way. ", "20": "Gehazi was the servant of Elisha the man of God. Gehazi thought, \u201cMy master has not accepted what Naaman the Aramean brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I'll run after him. I'll get something from him.\u201d ", "21": "So he went after him. Naaman saw someone running after him. So he got off the chariot to meet Gehazi. He said, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d", "22": "Gehazi said, \u201cEverything is all right. My master has sent me. He said, 'Two young men just came to me. They are from the group of the prophets in the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two changes of clothes.'\u201d", "23": "Naaman said, \u201cPlease take 150 pounds.\u201d He urged Gehazi to take it. He tied 150 pounds of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes. Then he gave them to two of his servants. They carried them for Gehazi. ", "24": "When they came to the hill, Gehazi took these things from Naaman's servants. And he put them in the house. He let Naaman's servants go, and they left.", "25": "Then he came in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, \u201cWhere have you been, Gehazi?\u201d Gehazi said, \u201cI didn't go anywhere.\u201d", "26": "But Elisha said to him, \u201cMy spirit was with you. I knew when the man turned from his chariot to meet you. This isn't a time to receive money, clothes, olives and grapes. It isn't a time to receive sheep, oxen, male servants and female servants. ", "27": "Naaman's skin disease will come on you and your children forever.\u201d When Gehazi left Elisha, he had the disease. He was as white as snow."}

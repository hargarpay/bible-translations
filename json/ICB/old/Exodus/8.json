The frogs will enter the houses of your officers and your people. They will enter your ovens and your baking pans. ", "4": "The frogs will jump up all over you, your people and your officers.'\u201d", "5": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cTell Aaron to hold his walking stick in his hand over the rivers, canals and ponds. Make frogs come up out of the water onto the land of Egypt.\u201d", "6": "So Aaron held his hand over all the waters of Egypt. The frogs came up out of the water and covered the land of Egypt.

He said, \u201cPray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people. I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.\u201d", "9": "Moses said to the king, \u201cPlease set the time that I should pray for you, your people and your officers.

Now go and pray for me.\u201d", "29": "Moses said, \u201cI will leave and pray to the Lord. He will take the flies away from you, your officers and your people tomorrow. But do not try to trick us again. Do not stop the people from going to offer sacrifices to the Lord.\u201d", "30": "So Moses left the king and prayed to the Lord.

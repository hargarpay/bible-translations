{"1": "The Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to the king of Egypt. I have made him and his officers stubborn. I did this so I could show them my powerful miracles. ", "2": "I also did this so you could tell your children and your grandchildren. Tell them how I made fools of the Egyptians. Tell them about the miracles I did among them. Then all of you will know that I am the Lord.\u201d", "3": "So Moses and Aaron went to the king. They told him, \u201cThis is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to be sorry for what you have done? Let my people go to worship me. ", "4": "If you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country. ", "5": "They will cover the land, and no one will be able to see the ground. They will eat anything that was left from the hailstorm. They will eat the leaves from every tree growing in the field. ", "6": "They will fill your palaces and all your officers' houses. They will fill the houses of all the Egyptian people. There will be more locusts than your fathers or ancestors have ever seen. There will be more locusts than there have been since people began living in Egypt.'\u201d Then Moses turned and walked away from the king.", "7": "The king's officers asked him, \u201cHow long will this man make trouble for us? Let the Israelite men go to worship the Lord their God. Don't you know that Egypt is ruined?\u201d", "8": "So Moses and Aaron were brought back to the king. He said to them, \u201cGo and worship the Lord your God. But tell me, just who is going?\u201d", "9": "Moses answered, \u201cWe will go with our young and our old people, our sons and daughters and sheep and cattle. This is because we are going to have a feast to honor the Lord.\u201d", "10": "The king said to them, \u201cThe Lord really will have to be with you if ever I let you and all of your children leave Egypt. See, you are planning something evil. ", "11": "No! Only the men may go and worship the Lord. That is what you have been asking for.\u201d Then the king forced Moses and Aaron out of his palace.", "12": "The Lord told Moses, \u201cRaise your hand over the land of Egypt, and the locusts will come. They will spread all over the land of Egypt. They will eat all the plants that the hail did not destroy.\u201d", "13": "So Moses raised his walking stick over the land of Egypt. And the Lord caused a strong wind to blow from the east. It blew across the land all that day and night. When morning came, the east wind had brought the locusts. ", "14": "Swarms of locusts covered all the land of Egypt and settled everywhere. There were more locusts than ever before or after. ", "15": "The locusts covered the whole land so that it was black. They ate everything that was left after the hail. They ate every plant in the field and all the fruit on the trees. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt.", "16": "The king quickly called for Moses and Aaron. He said, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord your God and against you. ", "17": "Now forgive my sin this time. Pray to the Lord your God. Ask him to stop this punishment that kills.\u201d", "18": "Moses left the king and prayed to the Lord. ", "19": "So the Lord changed the wind. He made a very strong wind to blow from the west. It blew the locusts away into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt. ", "20": "But the Lord caused the king to be stubborn again. And he did not let the people of Israel go.", "21": "Then the Lord told Moses, \u201cRaise your hand toward the sky, and darkness will cover the land of Egypt. It will be so dark you will be able to feel it.\u201d ", "22": "So Moses raised his hand toward the sky. Then total darkness was everywhere in Egypt for three days. ", "23": "No one could see anyone else. And no one could go anywhere for three days. But the Israelites had light where they lived.", "24": "Again the king of Egypt called for Moses. He said, \u201cAll of you may go and worship the Lord. You may take your women and children with you. But you must leave your sheep and cattle here.\u201d", "25": "Moses said, \u201cYou must let us have animals to use as sacrifices and burnt offerings. We have to offer them to the Lord our God. ", "26": "So we must take our animals with us. Not a hoof will be left behind. We have to use some of the animals to worship the Lord our God. We do not yet know exactly what we will need to worship the Lord. We will know when we get there.\u201d", "27": "But the Lord made the king stubborn again. So he refused to let them go. ", "28": "Then he told Moses, \u201cGet out of here! Don't come here again! The next time you see me, you will die.\u201d", "29": "Then Moses told the king, \u201cI'll do what you say. I will not come to see you again.\u201d"}

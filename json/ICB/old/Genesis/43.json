The governor of that country warned us. He said we would not see him if we didn't bring Benjamin with us.\u201d", "6": "Jacob, also called Israel, said, \u201cWhy did you tell the man you had another brother? You have caused me a lot of trouble.\u201d", "7": "The brothers answered, \u201cHe questioned us carefully about ourselves and our family. He asked us, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' We just answered his questions. How could we know he would ask us to bring our other brother to him?\u201d", "8": "Then Judah said to his father Jacob, \u201cSend Benjamin with me. Then we will go at once.

He had to hold back the tears when he saw his brother Benjamin. So Joseph went into his room and cried there. ", "31": "Then he washed his face and came out. He controlled himself and said, \u201cServe the meal.\u201d", "32": "So they served Joseph at one table. They served his brothers at another table.

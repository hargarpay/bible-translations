", "4": "The seven thin and ugly cows ate the seven beautiful fat cows. Then the king woke up. ", "5": "The king slept again and dreamed a second time. In his dream he saw seven full and good heads of grain growing on one stalk. ", "6": "After that, seven more heads of grain sprang up. But they were thin and burned by the hot east wind. ", "7": "The thin heads of grain ate the seven full and good heads. Then the king woke up again. And he realized it was only a dream.

But no one could explain their meaning to him.", "9": "Then the chief officer who served wine to the king said to him, \u201cI remember something I promised to do. But I had forgotten about it.

God will do this for the king.\u201d", "17": "Then the king said to Joseph, \u201cIn my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile River. ", "18": "I saw seven fat and beautiful cows. They came up out of the river and ate the grass. ", "19": "Then I saw seven more cows come out of the river. They were thin and lean and ugly. They were the worst looking cows I have seen in all the land of Egypt. ", "20": "And these thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows. ", "21": "But after they had eaten the seven cows, no one could tell they had eaten them. They just looked as thin and ugly as they did in the beginning.

", "35": "They should gather all the food that is produced during the good years that are coming. Under the king's authority they should store the grain in the cities and guard it. ", "36": "That food should be saved for later. It will be used during the seven years of hunger that will come on the land of Egypt. Then the people in Egypt will not die during the seven years of hunger.\u201d", "37": "This seemed like a very good idea to the king. All his officers agreed. ", "38": "And the king asked them, \u201cCan we find a better man than Joseph to take this job? God's spirit is truly in him!\u201d", "39": "So the king said to Joseph, \u201cGod has shown you all this. There is no one as wise and understanding as you are.

Men walked ahead of his chariot calling, \u201cBow down!\u201d By doing these things, the king put Joseph in charge of all of Egypt.", "44": "The king said to him, \u201cI am the king. And I say that no one in all the land of Egypt may lift a hand or a foot unless you say he may.\u201d ", "45": "The king gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave Joseph a wife named Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. So Joseph traveled through all the land of Egypt.", "46": "Joseph was 30 years old when he began serving the king of Egypt. And he left the king's court and traveled through all the land of Egypt. ", "47": "During the seven good years, the crops in the land grew well. ", "48": "And Joseph gathered all the food produced in Egypt during those seven years of good crops. He stored the food in the cities. In every city he stored grain that had been grown in the fields around that city. ", "49": "Joseph stored much grain, as much as the sand of the seashore. He stored so much grain that he could not measure it.", "50": "Joseph's wife was Asenath daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. Before the years of hunger came, Joseph and Asenath had two sons.

Do whatever he tells you to do.\u201d", "56": "The hunger was everywhere in that part of the world. And Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the people of Egypt. This was because the time of hunger became terrible in Egypt. ", "57": "And all the people in that part of the world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain. This was because the hunger was terrible everywhere in that part of the world."}

He said, \u201cDid God really say that you must not eat fruit from any tree in the garden?\u201d", "2": "The woman answered the snake, \u201cWe may eat fruit from the trees in the garden. ", "3": "But God told us, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not even touch it, or you will die.'\u201d", "4": "But the snake said to the woman, \u201cYou will not die. ", "5": "God knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree, you will learn about good and evil. Then you will be like God!\u201d", "6": "The woman saw that the tree was beautiful. She saw that its fruit was good to eat and that it would make her wise. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some of the fruit to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.", "7": "Then, it was as if the man's and the woman's eyes were opened. They realized they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made something to cover themselves.", "8": "Then they heard the Lord God walking in the garden. This was during the cool part of the day. And the man and his wife hid from the Lord God among the trees in the garden. ", "9": "But the Lord God called to the man. The Lord said, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d", "10": "The man answered, \u201cI heard you walking in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked. So I hid.\u201d", "11": "God said to the man, \u201cWho told you that you were naked? Did you eat fruit from that tree?

So I ate the fruit.\u201d", "14": "The Lord God said to the snake, \u201cBecause you did this, a curse will be put on you. You will be cursed more than any tame animal or wild animal. You will crawl on your stomach, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.", "15": "I will make you and the woman enemies to each other. Your descendants and her descendants will be enemies. Her child will crush your head. And you will bite his heel.\u201d", "16": "Then God said to the woman, \u201cI will cause you to have much trouble when you are pregnant. And when you give birth to children, you will have great pain. You will greatly desire your husband, but he will rule over you.\u201d", "17": "Then God said to the man, \u201cYou listened to what your wife said.

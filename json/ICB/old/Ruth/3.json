{"1": "Then Naomi, Ruth's mother-in-law, said to her, \u201cMy daughter, I must find a suitable home for you. That would be good for you. ", "2": "Now Boaz is our close relative.[a] You worked with his women servants. Tonight he will be working at the threshing floor. ", "3": "Go wash yourself and put on perfume. Change your clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But don't let him see you until he has finished eating and drinking. ", "4": "Then he will lie down. Watch him so you will know the place where he lies down. Go there and lift the cover off his feet[b] and lie down. He will tell you what you should do.\u201d", "5": "Then Ruth answered, \u201cI will do everything you say.\u201d", "6": "So Ruth went down to the threshing floor. She did all her mother-in-law told her to do. ", "7": "After eating and drinking, Boaz was feeling good. He went to lie down beside the pile of grain. Then Ruth went to him quietly. She lifted the cover from his feet and lay down.", "8": "About midnight Boaz woke up suddenly and rolled over. He was startled! There was a woman lying near his feet! ", "9": "Boaz asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d She said, \u201cI am Ruth, your servant girl. Spread your cover over me because you are the one who is to take care of me.\u201d", "10": "Then Boaz said, \u201cThe Lord bless you, my daughter. Your kindness to me is greater than the kindness you showed to Naomi in the beginning. You didn't look for a young man to marry, either rich or poor. ", "11": "Now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do everything you ask. All the people in our town know you are a very good woman. ", "12": "And it is true, I am a relative who is to take care of you. But there is a man who is a closer relative to you than I. ", "13": "But stay here tonight. In the morning we will see if he will take care of you. If he decides to take care of you, that is fine. If he refuses to take care of you, I myself will marry you. Then I will buy back Elimelech's land for you. As surely as the Lord lives, I promise to do this. So lie here until morning.\u201d", "14": "So Ruth lay near his feet until the morning. She rose while it was still too dark to be recognized. Boaz said to his servants, \u201cDon't tell anyone that the woman came here to the threshing floor.\u201d ", "15": "Then Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cBring me your shawl. Now, hold it open.\u201d So Ruth held her shawl open, and Boaz poured six portions of barley into it. Boaz then put it on her back, and she went to the city.", "16": "Ruth went to the home of her mother-in-law. And Naomi asked, \u201cHow did you do, my daughter?\u201d So Ruth told Naomi everything that Boaz did for her. ", "17": "She said, \u201cBoaz gave me these six portions of barley. He said, 'You must not go home without a gift for your mother-in-law.'\u201d", "18": "Naomi answered, \u201cRuth, my daughter, wait until you hear what happens. Boaz will not rest until he has finished doing what he should do this day.\u201d"}

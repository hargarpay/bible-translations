", "6": "You are not being sent to many nations whose speech you can't understand. The language of Israel is not difficult. You are not being sent to people whose words you cannot understand. If I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. ", "7": "But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you. This is because they are not willing to listen to me.

", "15": "I came to the captives from Judah. They lived by the Kebar River at Tel Abib. I sat there seven days where these people lived. I was shocked.", "16": "After seven days the Lord spoke his word to me again. He said, ", "17": "\u201cHuman being, I have made you a watchman for Israel. Any time you hear a word from my mouth, warn them for me. ", "18": "When I say to an evil person, 'You will surely die,' you must warn him. If you don't speak out to warn the evil person to leave his evil way, he will die in his sin. But I will hold you responsible for his death. ", "19": "You must warn the evil person. Then if he does not turn from his wickedness or his evil ways, he will die because of his sin.

Bring your weapon in your hand.\u201d ", "2": "Then six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each had his powerful weapon in his hand. Among them was a man dressed in linen. At his side he had things to write with. The men went in and stood by the bronze altar.", "3": "Then the glory of the God of Israel went up. It had been above the creatures with wings. It moved to the place in the Temple where the door opened. Then the Lord called the man dressed in linen. He had the things to write with at his side. ", "4": "The Lord said to him, \u201cGo through Jerusalem. Put a mark on the foreheads of the people who groan and cry about all the terrible things being done among them.\u201d", "5": "As I listened, the Lord spoke to the other men. He said, \u201cGo through the city behind the man dressed in linen and kill. Don't pity anyone. Don't show mercy. ", "6": "Kill and destroy old men, young men and women, little children and older women. But don't touch anyone who has the mark on him.

The land is filled with people who murder. And the city is full of people who are not fair. The people say, 'The Lord has left the land. And the Lord does not see.' ", "10": "But I will have no pity.

He said, \u201cI have done just as you have commanded me.\u201d"}

Prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Lord God says: How terrible it will be for the shepherds of Israel who feed only themselves! Why don't the shepherds feed the flock? ", "3": "You eat the milk curds from the sheep. You clothe yourselves with the wool from the sheep. You kill the fat sheep. But you do not feed the flock. ", "4": "You have not made the weak strong. You have not healed the sick. You have not put bandages on those that were hurt. You have not brought back those who strayed away. You have not searched for the lost. You ruled the sheep with cruel force. ", "5": "The sheep were scattered because there was no shepherd. Then they became food for every wild animal. ", "6": "My flock wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over all the face of the earth. And no one searched or looked for them.", "7": "\u201c'So, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says: ", "8": "As surely as I live, my flock has been caught. It has become food for all the wild animals. This is because the flock has no shepherd. The shepherds did not search for my flock. No, they fed themselves instead of my flock.

I will do this on a cloudy and dark day. ", "13": "I will bring them out from the nations. I will gather them from the countries. I will bring them to their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains and in the ravines of Israel. And I will feed them in all the places where people live in the land. ", "14": "I will feed them in a good pasture. They will eat grass on the high mountains of Israel. They will lie down on good ground where they eat grass. They will eat in rich grassland on the mountains of Israel.

I will judge between the male sheep and the male goats. ", "18": "Is it not enough for you to eat grass in the good land? Must you crush the rest of the grass with your feet?

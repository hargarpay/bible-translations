", "38": "They have also done this to me: They made my Temple unclean at the same time they dishonored my Sabbaths. ", "39": "They offered their children to their idols. Then they entered my Temple at that very time to dishonor it. That is what they did inside my Temple.", "40": "\u201cThey even sent for men from far away. A messenger was sent to them, and they came. The two sisters bathed themselves for them, painted their eyes and put on jewelry. ", "41": "They sat on a fine bed with a table set before it.

He said: ", "2": "\u201cHuman being, look toward the king of Egypt. And prophesy against him and all Egypt. ", "3": "Say: 'This is what the Lord God says: I am against you, king of Egypt. You are like a great crocodile that lies in the Nile River. You say, \u201cThe Nile is mine. I made it for myself.\u201d", "4": "But I will put hooks in your jaws. I will make the fish of the Nile stick to your sides. I will pull you up out of your rivers, with all the fish sticking to your sides.", "5": "I will leave you in the desert. I will leave you and all the fish from your rivers. You will fall on the open field. You will not be picked up or buried. I have given you to the wild animals. And I have given you to the birds of the sky for food.", "6": "Then all the people who live in Egypt will know that I am the Lord. \u201c'Israel tried to lean on you for help. But you were like a crutch made out of a weak stalk of grass. ", "7": "When their hands grabbed you, you splintered and tore open their shoulders.

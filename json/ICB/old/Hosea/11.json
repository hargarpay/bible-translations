{"1": "\u201cWhen Israel was a child, I loved him. And I called my son out of Egypt.", "2": "But the more I called to the people of Israel, the further they went from me. They offered sacrifices to the Baals. They burned incense to the idols.", "3": "But it was I who taught Israel to walk. I took them by the arms. But they did not understand that I had healed them.", "4": "I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. I lifted the yoke from their neck. I bent down and fed them.", "5": "\u201cThe Israelites will become captives again, as they were in Egypt. The king of Assyria will become their king. This is because they refuse to turn to God.", "6": "War will sweep through their cities. It will destroy them, because of their wicked plans.", "7": "My people have made up their minds to turn away from me. The prophets call them to turn to me. But none of them honors me at all.", "8": "\u201cIsrael, I don't want to give you up. I don't want to go away and leave you. I don't want to make you like Admah. I don't want to treat you like Zeboiim.[a] My heart beats for you. My love for you stirs up my pity.", "9": "I won't punish you in my anger. I won't destroy Israel again. I am God and not man. I am the Holy One, and I am among you. I will not come against you in anger.", "10": "I will call for my people like a lion calling for its young. My children will come and follow me. They will hurry to me from the west.", "11": "They will come swiftly like birds from a captivity like Egypt was, and like doves from Assyria. I will settle them again in their homes,\u201d says the Lord.", "12": "Israel has surrounded me with lies. The people of Israel have made their secret plans. And Judah turns against God, the faithful Holy One."}

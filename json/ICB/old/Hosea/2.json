And I am not treated like her husband. Tell her to stop acting like a prostitute. Tell her to stop behaving like an unfaithful wife.", "3": "If she refuses, I will strip her naked. I will leave her bare like the day she was born. I will make her dry like a desert. I will make her like a land without water. I will kill her with thirst.", "4": "I will not take pity on her children. They are the children of an unfaithful wife.", "5": "Their mother has acted like a prostitute. The one who became pregnant with them has acted disgracefully. She said, 'I will chase after my lovers.[b] They give me food and water. They give me wool and linen. They give me wine and olive oil.'", "6": "So I will block her road with thornbushes. I will build a wall around her so she cannot find her way.", "7": "She will run after her lovers.

I will stop all of her special feasts.", "12": "I will destroy her vines and fig trees. She said they were her pay from her lovers. I will turn them into a forest. Wild animals will eat those plants.", "13": "I will punish her for all the times she burned incense to the Baals. She put on her rings and jewelry. Then she went chasing after her lovers. But she has forgotten me!\u201d says the Lord.", "14": "\u201cSo I am going to attract her. I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her.", "15": "Then I will give her back her vineyards. And I will make the Valley of Achor[d] a door of hope.

Then my people will live in safety.", "19": "And I will make you my promised bride forever. I will be good and fair.

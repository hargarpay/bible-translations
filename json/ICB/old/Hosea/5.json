You have been like a net spread out at Mount Tabor.", "2": "You have done many bad things. So I will punish you all.", "3": "I know all about Israel. What they have done is not hidden from me. They all act like prostitutes. Israel has made itself unclean.", "4": "\u201cAnd those bad things they have done keep them from returning to their God. They are determined to be unfaithful to me.

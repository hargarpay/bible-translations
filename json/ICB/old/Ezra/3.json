That's where they offered burnt offerings just as it is written in the Teachings of Moses. Moses was the man of God. ", "3": "They were afraid of the people living around them. But they still built the altar where it had been before. They offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord morning and evening.

But the foundation of the Lord's Temple had not yet been laid.", "7": "Then they gave money to the stoneworkers and carpenters. They also gave food, wine and oil to the cities of Sidon and Tyre.

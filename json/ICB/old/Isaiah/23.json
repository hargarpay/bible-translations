{"1": "The message about Tyre: You ships of Tarshish, cry! The houses and harbor of Tyre are destroyed. This news came to the ships from the land of Cyprus.", "2": "Be silent, you who live on the island of Tyre. You merchants of Sidon, be silent. Seamen have made you rich.", "3": "They traveled the sea to bring grain from Egypt. The men of Tyre brought grain from the Nile Valley and sold it to other nations.", "4": "Sidon, be ashamed. Strong city of the sea, be ashamed. The sea says: \u201cI have not felt the pain of giving birth. I have not reared young men or women.\u201d", "5": "Egypt will hear the news about Tyre. And it will make Egypt hurt with sorrow.", "6": "You ships should return to Tarshish. You people living near the sea should be sad.", "7": "Look at your once happy city! Look at your old, old city! People from that city have traveled far away to live.", "8": "Who planned Tyre's destruction? Tyre made others rich. Her merchants were treated like princes. Her traders were greatly respected.", "9": "It was the Lord of heaven's armies who planned this! He decided to make these proud men unimportant. He decided to disgrace those who were greatly respected.", "10": "Go through your land, Tarshish, like the Nile goes through Egypt. There is no harbor for you now!", "11": "The Lord has stretched his hand over the sea. He makes its kingdoms tremble. He commands that Canaan's places of safety be destroyed.", "12": "The Lord said, \u201cSidon, you will not rejoice any longer. You are destroyed. Even if you cross the sea to Cyprus, you will not find a place to rest.\u201d", "13": "Look at the land of the Babylonians. Babylonia is not a country now. Assyria has made it a place for wild animals. Assyria built towers to attack it. The soldiers took all the treasures from its cities. They turned it into ruins.", "14": "So be sad, you trading ships. Your place of safety is destroyed.", "15": "At that time people will forget about Tyre for 70 years. That is the length of a king's life. After 70 years, Tyre will be like the prostitute in this song:", "16": "\u201cOh woman, you are forgotten. Take your harp and walk through the city. Play your harp well. Sing your song often. Then people will remember you.\u201d", "17": "After 70 years the Lord will deal with Tyre. Tyre will again have trade. It will be like a prostitute for all the nations of the earth. ", "18": "The profits will be saved for the Lord. Tyre will not keep the money she earns. It will give them to the people who serve the Lord. So they will have plenty of food and nice clothes."}

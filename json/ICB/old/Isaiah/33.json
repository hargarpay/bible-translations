Lord, give us strength every morning. Save us when we are in trouble.", "3": "Your powerful voice makes people run away in fear. Your greatness causes the nations to run away.", "4": "Like locusts, your enemies will take away the things you stole in war.

The trees of Bashan and Carmel are dying.", "10": "The Lord says, \u201cNow, I will stand up and show my greatness. Now, I will become important to the people.", "11": "You people do useless things. These things are like hay and straw. A destructive wind will burn you like fire.", "12": "People will be burned until their bones become like lime. They will burn quickly like dry thornbushes.\u201d", "13": "You people in faraway lands, hear what I have done. You people who are near me, learn about my power.", "14": "The sinners in Jerusalem are afraid. The people who are separated from God shake with fear. They say, \u201cCan any of us live through this fire that destroys? Who can live near this fire that burns on and on?\u201d", "15": "A person might do what is right. He might speak what is right.

Where is the officer in charge of our defense towers?\u201d", "19": "You will not see those proud people from other countries anymore. No more will you hear their strange language that you couldn't understand.", "20": "Look at Jerusalem, the city of our festivals. Look at Jerusalem, that beautiful place of rest. It is like a tent that will never be moved. The pegs that hold her in place will never be moved. Her ropes will never be broken.", "21": "There the Lord will be our Mighty One.

They rejoice and are glad to do my will.", "4": "Listen to the loud noise in the mountains. It sounds like many people. Listen to the noise among the kingdoms. Nations are gathering together. The Lord of heaven's armies is calling his army together for battle.", "5": "This army is coming from a faraway land. It is coming from the edge of the horizon.

God All-Powerful is sending destruction.", "7": "People will be weak with fear. Their courage will melt away.", "8": "Everyone will be afraid. Pain and hurt will grab them.

Wild goats will leap about in the houses.", "22": "Wolves will howl within the strong walls. Wild dogs will bark in the beautiful buildings. The end of Babylon is near. Its time is almost over.\u201d"}

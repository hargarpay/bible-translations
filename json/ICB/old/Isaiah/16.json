They are like little birds that have fallen from their nest.", "3": "They say: \u201cHelp us. Tell us what to do. Protect us from our enemies as shade protects us from the noon sun. Hide us because we are running for safety! Don't give us to our enemies.", "4": "Let those of us who were forced out of Moab live in your land. Hide us from our enemies.\u201d The robbing of Moab will stop. The enemy will be defeated. The men who hurt others will disappear from the land.", "5": "Then a new loyal king will come.

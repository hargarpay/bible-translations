So I will be kind to Hanun son of Nahash.\u201d Then David sent a group to comfort Hanun about the death of his father. David's men went to comfort Hanun in the country of Ammon. ", "3": "But the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, \u201cDon't be fooled. David didn't send these men to comfort you. They are not here to honor your dead father. David sent his men to spy on you and your land. He wants to destroy your country.\u201d ", "4": "So Hanun arrested David's men. To shame them he cut off their beards and cut off their clothes at the hips. Then he sent them away.", "5": "David's men were too ashamed to go home. Some people came to David and told him what had happened to his men. So he sent messengers to meet them. He said, \u201cStay in Jericho until your beards have grown back.

So he sent out Joab and the whole army of Israel. ", "9": "The Ammonites came out and got ready for battle. They were near the city gate. The kings who had come to help stayed out in the fields by themselves.", "10": "Joab saw that there were enemy troops in front of him and behind him. So Joab chose some of the best soldiers of Israel. And he sent them out to fight the Arameans. ", "11": "Joab put the rest of the army of Israel under the command of Abishai, his brother. Then they went out to fight the Ammonites. ", "12": "Joab said to Abishai, \u201cThe Arameans may be too strong for me. If they are, then you must help me. Or, the Ammonites may be too strong for you. If they are, then I will help you. ", "13": "Let's be strong. We must fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God.

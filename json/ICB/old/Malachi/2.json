I have already cursed them because you don't pay attention to what I say.", "3": "\u201cI will punish your descendants. I will smear your faces with the garbage from your feasts. And you will be thrown away with it. ", "4": "Then you will know why I am giving you this command. It is so that my agreement with Levi will continue,\u201d says the Lord of heaven's armies. ", "5": "\u201cMy agreement for priests was with the tribe of Levi. I promised them life and peace. And I gave these to them so they would honor me. They did honor me and fear me. ", "6": "They taught the true teachings. They spoke no lies. With peace and honesty they did what I said they should do. They kept many people from sinning.", "7": "\u201cA priest should teach what he knows. People should learn the teachings from him because he is the messenger of the Lord of heaven's armies.

Tell them: 'This is what the Lord has commanded: ", "3": "An Israelite might sacrifice an ox, a lamb or a goat. He might kill it inside the camp or outside it. ", "4": "But he should have brought the animal to the entrance to the Meeting Tent. He should have given the animal as a gift to the Lord. If he didn't, he is guilty of killing. He must be separated from his people. ", "5": "This rule is so people will bring their sacrifices to the Lord. They have been sacrificing in the open fields. But they must bring those animals to the Lord at the entrance of the Meeting Tent. They must bring them to the priest and offer them as fellowship offerings. ", "6": "Then the priest will sprinkle the blood from those animals on the Lord's altar. It is near the entrance to the Meeting Tent. And the priest will burn the fat from those animals on the altar. This smell will be pleasing to the Lord. ", "7": "They must not offer any more sacrifices to their goat idols. They have chased after those other gods. In that way they have acted like prostitutes. These rules will continue for people from now on.'", "8": "\u201cTell the people this: 'Someone might offer a burnt offering or sacrifice. He might be a citizen of Israel.

We are like a passing shadow that does not last.", "3": "Lord, do you need to watch someone like this? Do you need to bring him before you to be judged?", "4": "I wish something clean could come from something unclean. But it never can!", "5": "Our time is limited. You have given us only so many months to live. You have set limits we cannot go beyond.", "6": "So look away from us and leave us alone. Leave us alone until we put in our time like a hired man.", "7": "\u201cThere is hope for a tree. If you cut it down, it will grow again.

It will put out new shoots like a plant.", "10": "But we die, and our bodies are laid in the ground. We take our last breath and are gone.", "11": "Water disappears from a lake.

And rushing waters wash away the dirt. In the same way, you destroy hope.", "20": "You defeat man forever, and he is gone. You change his appearance and send him away.", "21": "His sons are honored, but he does not know it. His sons are disgraced, but he does not see it.", "22": "He only feels the pain of his body.

I have been seriously hurt, even though I have not sinned.'", "7": "There is no other man like Job. He takes insults as if he were drinking water.", "8": "He is around people who do evil. He spends time with wicked men.", "9": "This is because he says, 'It does not help a man to try and please God.'", "10": "\u201cSo listen to me, you who can understand.

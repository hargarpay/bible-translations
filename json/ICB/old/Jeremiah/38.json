{"1": "Some of the officers heard what Jeremiah was prophesying. They were Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Pashhur son of Malkijah. Jeremiah was telling all the people this message: ", "2": "\u201cThis is what the Lord says: 'Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die in war. Or he will die of hunger or terrible diseases. But everyone who surrenders to the Babylonian army will live. They will escape with their lives and live.' ", "3": "And this is what the Lord says: 'This city of Jerusalem will surely be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon. He will capture this city!'\u201d", "4": "Then the officers said to the king, \u201cJeremiah must be put to death! He is making the soldiers who are still in the city become discouraged. He is discouraging everyone by the things he is saying. He does not want good to happen to us. He wants to ruin the people of Jerusalem.\u201d", "5": "King Zedekiah said to them, \u201cJeremiah is in your control. I cannot do anything to stop you!\u201d", "6": "So the officers took Jeremiah and put him into the well of Malkijah, the king's son. That well was in the courtyard of the guards. The officers used ropes to lower Jeremiah into the well. It did not have any water in it, only mud. And Jeremiah sank down into the mud.", "7": "But Ebed-Melech heard that the officers had put Jeremiah into the well. Ebed-Melech was a Cushite, and he was a eunuch in the palace. King Zedekiah was sitting at the Benjamin Gate. ", "8": "So Ebed-Melech left the palace and went to the king. Ebed-Melech said, ", "9": "\u201cMy master and king, the rulers have acted in an evil way. They have treated Jeremiah the prophet badly! They have thrown him into a well! They have left him there to die! When there is no more bread in the city, he will starve.\u201d", "10": "Then King Zedekiah commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite: \u201cEbed-Melech, take 30 men from the palace with you. Go and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the well before he dies.\u201d", "11": "So Ebed-Melech took the men with him. And he went to a room under the storeroom in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from that room. Then he let those rags down with some ropes to Jeremiah in the well. ", "12": "Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, \u201cPut these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms. They will be pads for the ropes.\u201d So Jeremiah did as Ebed-Melech said. ", "13": "The men pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the well. And Jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard.", "14": "Then King Zedekiah sent someone to get Jeremiah the prophet. He had Jeremiah brought to the third entrance to the Temple of the Lord. Then the king said to Jeremiah, \u201cI am going to ask you something. Do not hide anything from me. But tell me everything honestly.\u201d", "15": "Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, \u201cIf I give you an answer, you will probably kill me. And even if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.\u201d", "16": "But King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah. He said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives who has given us breath and life, I will not kill you. And I promise not to give you to the officers who want to kill you.\u201d", "17": "Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, \u201cThis is what the Lord God of heaven's armies, the God of Israel, says: 'You must surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon. Then your life will be saved. And Jerusalem will not be burned down. And you and your family will live. ", "18": "You must not refuse to surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon. If you do, Jerusalem will be given to the Babylonian army. They will burn Jerusalem down. And you will not escape from them.'\u201d", "19": "Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, \u201cI'm afraid of some of the Jews. They have already gone over to the side of the Babylonian army. I'm afraid the Babylonians may hand me over to them. And they will treat me badly.\u201d", "20": "But Jeremiah answered, \u201cThe Babylonians will not hand you over to the Jews. Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you. Then things will go well for you. And your life will be saved.

They will be taken to the important officers of the king of Babylon. Your women will make fun of you with this song: 'Your good friends led you the wrong way and were stronger than you. Those were friends that you trusted. Your feet are stuck in the mud. Your friends have left you.'", "23": "\u201cAll your wives and children will be brought out. They will be given to the Babylonian army. You yourself will not even escape from them. You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylon. And Jerusalem will be burned down.\u201d", "24": "Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, \u201cDo not tell anyone that I have been talking to you. If you do, you will die. ", "25": "Those officers might find out that I talked to you. Then they will come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to King Zedekiah. And tell us what King Zedekiah said to you. Don't keep any secrets from us. If you don't tell us everything, we will kill you.' ", "26": "If they ask you, tell them this: 'I was begging the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house to die.'\u201d", "27": "The officers did come to question Jeremiah. So he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. Then the officers said no more to Jeremiah. This was because no one had heard what Jeremiah and the king had discussed.", "28": "So Jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured."}

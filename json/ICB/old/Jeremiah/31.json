I have come to give rest to Israel.\u201d", "3": "And from far away the Lord appeared to his people. He said, \u201cI love you people with a love that will last forever. I became your friend because of my love and kindness.", "4": "People of Israel, I will build you up again, and you will be rebuilt. You will pick up your tambourines again. You will dance with those who are joyful.", "5": "You will plant vineyards again on the hills around Samaria. The farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit.", "6": "There will be a time when watchmen in the mountains of Ephraim shout this message: 'Come, let's go up to Jerusalem to worship the Lord our God!'\u201d", "7": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cBe happy and sing for the people of Jacob. Shout for Israel, the greatest of the nations. Sing your praises and shout this: 'Lord, save your people! Save those who are left alive from the nation of Israel!'", "8": "Look, I will bring Israel from the country in the north. I will gather them from the faraway places on earth. Some of the people are blind and crippled. Some of the women will be pregnant and ready to give birth. A great many people will come back.", "9": "Those people will be crying as they come back. But they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead those people by streams of water. I will lead them on an even road where they will not stumble. This is because I am Israel's father. And Israel is my firstborn son.", "10": "\u201cNations, listen to the message from the Lord. Tell this message in the faraway lands by the sea: 'The one who scattered the people of Israel will bring them back together.

The Lord will buy them back from people stronger than they were.", "12": "The people of Israel will come to the high points of Jerusalem. There they will shout for joy. Their faces will shine with happiness about all the good things from the Lord: the grain, new wine, oil, young sheep and cows. They will be like a garden that has plenty of water. And the people of Israel will not be troubled anymore.", "13": "Then young women of Israel will be happy and dance. The young men and old men will also dance.

You will be rewarded for your work!\u201d says the Lord. \u201cThe people will come back from their enemy's land.", "17": "So there is hope for you!\u201d says the Lord. \u201cYour children will come back to their own land.", "18": "\u201cI have heard Israel moaning: 'Lord, you punished me, and I have learned my lesson.

Once I understood, I beat my breast with sorrow. I am ashamed and disgraced because of the foolish things I did when I was young.'", "20": "\u201cYou know that Israel is my dear son. I love that child. Yes, I often speak against Israel, but I still remember him. I love him very much. And I want to comfort him,\u201d says the Lord.", "21": "\u201cPeople of Israel, fix the road signs. Put up the signs that show you the way home. Watch the road. Pay attention to the road on which you travel. People of Israel, come home. Come back to your towns.", "22": "You are an unfaithful daughter. How long will you wander before you come home?

My sleep had been very pleasant.", "27": "The Lord says, \u201cThe days are coming when I will help the families of Israel and Judah to grow. I will help their children and animals to grow, too. It will be like planting and caring for a plant. ", "28": "In the past I watched over Israel and Judah, but I watched for the time to pull them up. I tore them down. I destroyed them.

And I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.", "34": "People will no longer have to teach their neighbors and relatives to know the Lord. This is because all people will know me, from the least to the most important,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cI will forgive them for the wicked things they did. I will not remember their sins anymore.\u201d", "35": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cThe Lord makes the sun shine in the day. And he makes the moon and stars shine at night.

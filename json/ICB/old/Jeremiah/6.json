Disaster is coming from the north. Terrible destruction is coming to you.", "2": "Jerusalem, I will destroy you. You are fragile and gentle.", "3": "Shepherds with their flocks will come against Jerusalem. They will set up their tents all around her. Each shepherd will take care of his own section.\u201d", "4": "They say, \u201cGet ready to fight against Jerusalem! Get up! We will attack at noon! But it is already getting late. The evening shadows are growing long.", "5": "So get up! We will attack at night. We will destroy the strong towers of Jerusalem!\u201d", "6": "This is what the Lord of heaven's armies says: \u201cCut down the trees around Jerusalem. Build an attack ramp to the top of Jerusalem's walls. This city must be punished! Inside this city is nothing but slavery.", "7": "Jerusalem pours out her evil as a well pours out its water. The sounds of violence and destruction are heard within her. I can see the sickness and hurts of Jerusalem.", "8": "Listen to this warning, Jerusalem. If you don't listen, I will turn my back on you. I will make your land an empty desert. No one will be able to live there!\u201d", "9": "This is what the Lord of heaven's armies says: \u201cGather the few people of Israel who are left alive.

I am tired of holding it in. \u201cPour out the Lord's anger on the children who play in the street. Pour it out on the young men gathered together. A husband and his wife will both be caught in his anger. The very old people will be caught in it.", "12": "Their houses will be turned over to others. Their fields and wives will be given away. I will raise my hand and punish the people of Judah,\u201d says the Lord.", "13": "\u201cEveryone, from the least important to the greatest, is greedy for money.

But really, it is not all right.", "15": "They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act. But they are not ashamed at all. They don't even know how to blush about their sins. So they will fall, along with everyone else. They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them,\u201d says the Lord.", "16": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cStand where the roads cross and look. Ask where the old way is.

They have not listened to my messages. They have rejected my teachings.", "20": "Why do you bring me offerings of incense from the land of Sheba? Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway land? Your burnt offerings will not be accepted.

You must observe their ways. And you must test them.", "28": "My people have turned against me and are stubborn. They go around telling lies about people. They are like bronze and iron, that became covered with rust.", "29": "The fire is fanned to make it hotter. But the lead does not melt. The pure silver does not come out. And the evil is not removed from my people.", "30": "My people will be called rejected silver. They will be given that name because the Lord has rejected them.\u201d"}

I made it with them when I brought them out of Egypt. Egypt was like a furnace for melting iron!' I told them, 'Obey me and do everything I command you. If you do this, you will be my people. And I will be your God. ", "5": "Then I will keep the promise I made to your ancestors. I promised to give them a land where much food grows.'

", "2": "The bones will be spread on the ground under the sun, moon and stars the people loved and served. They went after these gods, searched them out and worshiped them. No one will gather up the bones and bury them. So they will be like dung thrown on the ground. ", "3": "I will force the people of Judah to leave their homes and their land. Those of this evil family who are not dead will wish they were dead, says the Lord.'", "4": "\u201cSay to the people of Judah: 'This is what the Lord says: When a man falls down, doesn't he get up again? And when a man goes the wrong way, doesn't he come back again?", "5": "Why, then, have the people of Judah gone the wrong way? And why do the people of Jerusalem not turn back? They believe their own lies. They refuse to turn around and come back.", "6": "I have listened to them very carefully. But they do not say what is right. They do not feel sorry about their wicked ways. The people don't think about the bad things they have done. Each person goes his own way. He is like a horse charging into a battle.", "7": "Even the birds in the sky know the right times to do things. The storks, doves, swifts and thrushes know when it is time to migrate.

Even the prophets and priests all tell lies.", "11": "They try to heal my people's serious injuries as if they were small wounds. They say, \u201cIt's all right, it's all right!\u201d But really, it is not all right.", "12": "They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act. But they are not ashamed at all. They don't even know how to blush about their sins. So they will fall, along with everyone else. They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them, says the Lord.", "13": "\u201c'I will take away their crops, says the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the fig tree. Even the leaves will dry up and die. I will take away what I gave them!'\u201d", "14": "\u201cWhy are we just sitting here? Let's get together! We have sinned against the Lord. So he has given us poisoned water to drink. Come, let's run to the strong, walled cities. The Lord our God has decided that we must die.

They are crying for help from a faraway land. They say, \u201cIs the Lord still in Jerusalem? Is Jerusalem's king still there?\u201d But God says, \u201cWhy did the people make me angry by worshiping idols? They worshiped their useless foreign idols.\u201d", "20": "And the people say, \u201cHarvest time is over. Summer has ended. And we have not been saved.\u201d", "21": "My people are crushed.

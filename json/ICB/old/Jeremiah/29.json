", "3": "Zedekiah king of Judah had sent Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah to King Nebuchadnezzar. So Jeremiah gave the letter to them to take to Babylon.

Plant gardens and eat the food you grow. ", "6": "Get married and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons. Let your daughters be married so they may also have sons and daughters. Have many children and grow in number in Babylon. Don't become fewer in number. ", "7": "Also do good things for the city where I sent you as captives. Pray to the Lord for the city where you are living. If there is peace in that city, you will have peace also.\u201d ", "8": "The Lord of heaven's armies, the God of Israel, says: \u201cDon't let your prophets and the people who do magic fool you. Don't listen to their dreams. ", "9": "They are prophesying lies. And they are saying that their message is from me. But I did not send them,\u201d says the Lord.", "10": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cBabylon will be powerful for 70 years. After that time I will come to you who are living in Babylon. I will keep my promise to bring you back to Jerusalem. ", "11": "I say this because I know what I have planned for you,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cI have good plans for you. I don't plan to hurt you.

And they said those lies were a message from me, the Lord. I did not tell them to do that. I know what they have done. I am a witness!\u201d says the Lord.", "24": "Also give a message to Shemaiah.

{"1": "This message is about the Ammonite people. This is what the Lord says: \u201cDo you think that Israel has no sons? Do you think there is no one to take the land when the parents die? Maybe that is why Molech took Gad's land. Maybe that is why Molech's people live in Gad's towns.\u201d", "2": "The Lord says, \u201cThe time will come when I will make the capital city of Rabbah Ammon hear the battle cry. It will be a hill covered with ruins. And the towns around it will be burned. Those people forced Israel out of that land. But now the people of Israel will force them out!\u201d says the Lord.", "3": "\u201cPeople in Heshbon, cry because the town of Ai is destroyed! Those who live in Rabbah Ammon, cry out! Put on your rough cloth to show your sadness, and cry loudly. Run here and there for safety inside the walls. This is because the enemy will take Molech away as a captive. They will also take away his priests and officers with him.", "4": "You brag about your valleys. You brag about the fruit in your valleys. You are like an unfaithful child.

Have they lost their wisdom?", "8": "You people living in Dedan, run away and hide in deep caves. This is because I will punish the people of Esau with disaster for what they did.", "9": "If workers came and picked the grapes from your vines, they would leave a few grapes behind. If robbers came at night, they would steal only enough for themselves.", "10": "But I will strip Esau bare. I will find all their hiding places. They will not be able to hide from me. The children, relatives and neighbors will die.", "11": "Leave the orphans, and I will take care of them. Your widows also can trust in me.\u201d", "12": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cSome people did not deserve to be punished. But they had to drink from the cup of suffering anyway.

None of their leaders can stand up against me.\u201d", "20": "So listen to what the Lord has planned to do against Edom. Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in Teman. The Lord will surely drag away the young ones of Edom. Edom's pastures will surely be destroyed because of them.", "21": "At the sound of Edom's fall, the earth will shake. Their cry will be heard all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba.", "22": "The Lord is like an eagle swooping down. He is like an eagle spreading its wings over the city of Bozrah.

He must speak the truth from his heart.", "3": "He must not tell lies about others. He must do no wrong to his neighbors. He must not gossip.", "4": "He must not respect hateful people. He must honor those who honor the Lord. He must keep his promises to his neighbor, even when it hurts.", "5": "He must not charge interest on money he lends. And he must not take money to hurt innocent people. Whoever does all these things will never be destroyed."}

{"1": "Look how the Lord in his anger has brought Jerusalem to shame. He has thrown down the greatness of Israel from the sky to the earth. He did not remember the Temple, his footstool, on the day of his anger.", "2": "The Lord swallowed up without mercy all the houses of the people of Jacob. In his anger he pulled down the strong places of Judah. He threw her kingdom and its rulers down to the ground in dishonor.", "3": "In his anger the Lord has removed all the strength of Israel. He took away his power from Israel when the enemy came. He burned against the people of Jacob like a flaming fire that burns up everything around it.", "4": "Like an enemy, the Lord prepared to shoot his bow. He took hold of his sword. Like an enemy, he killed all the good-looking people. He poured out his anger like fire on the tents of Jerusalem.", "5": "The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces. He has destroyed all her strong places. He has caused more moaning and groaning for Judah.", "6": "He has destroyed his Temple as if it were a garden tent.

The enemy shouted in the Lord's Temple as if it were a feast day.", "8": "The Lord planned to destroy the wall around Jerusalem. He marked the wall off with a measuring line. He did not stop himself from destroying it. He made the walls and defenses sad. Together they have fallen.", "9": "Jerusalem's gates have fallen to the ground.

The prophets have not had any visions from the Lord.", "10": "The elders of Jerusalem sit on the ground and are silent. They pour dust on their heads and put on rough cloth to show how sad they are. The young women of Jerusalem bow their heads to the ground in sorrow.", "11": "My eyes are weak from crying. I am troubled. I feel as if I have been poured out on the ground because my people have been destroyed. Children and babies are fainting in the streets of the city.", "12": "They say to their mothers, \u201cWhere is some bread and wine?\u201d They faint like wounded soldiers in the streets of the city. They die in their mothers' arms.", "13": "What can I say about you, Jerusalem? What can I compare you to? What can I say you are like? How can I comfort you, Jerusalem? Your ruin is as big as the sea. No one can heal you.", "14": "Your prophets saw visions about you. But they were false and worth nothing. They did not expose your sins. They did not keep you from being captured. The messages they preached to you were false. They fooled you.", "15": "All who pass by on the road clap their hands at you. They make fun and shake their heads at Jerusalem. They ask, \u201cIs this the city that people called the most beautiful city, the happiest city on earth?\u201d", "16": "All your enemies open their mouths to say things against you. They make fun and grind their teeth in anger. They say, \u201cWe have swallowed her up. This is the day we were waiting for. We have finally seen it happen.\u201d", "17": "The Lord has done what he planned. He has carried out the order that he commanded long ago. He has destroyed without mercy.

Pour out your heart like water in prayer to the Lord. Lift up your hands in prayer to him. Pray for the life of your children. They are fainting with hunger on every street corner.", "20": "Jerusalem says: \u201cLook, Lord, and see. You have never done this to anyone else. Women eat their own babies, the children they have cared for. Priests and prophets are killed in the Temple of the Lord.", "21": "\u201cYoung men and old men lie on the ground in the streets of the city. My young women and young men have been killed by the sword. You, Lord, killed them on the day of your anger. You killed them without mercy.", "22": "\u201cYou invited terrors to come against me on every side. It was as if you were inviting them to a feast. No one escaped or remained alive on the day of the Lord's anger. My enemy has killed those whom I gave birth to and brought up.\u201d"}

I'm dark like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.", "6": "Don't look at how dark I am, at how dark the sun has made me. My brothers were angry with me. They made me tend the vineyards.

Am I like a woman who wears a veil?[a]", "8": "You are the most beautiful of women. Surely you know to follow the sheep.

And the wood of our ceiling is juniper trees."}

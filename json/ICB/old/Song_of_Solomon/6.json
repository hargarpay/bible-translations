He feeds among the lilies.", "4": "My darling, you are as beautiful as the city of Tirzah. You are as lovely as the city of Jerusalem. You are as wonderful as an army flying flags.", "5": "Turn your eyes from me. They excite me too much!

None of them is alone.", "7": "Your cheeks behind your veil are like slices of a pomegranate.", "8": "There may be 60 queens and 80 slave women and so many girls you cannot count them.", "9": "But there is only one like my dove, my perfect one.

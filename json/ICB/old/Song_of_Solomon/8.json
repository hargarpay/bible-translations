{"1": "I wish you were like my brother who was fed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you. And no one would look down on me.", "2": "I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house. She is the one who has taught me. I would give you a drink of spiced wine from my pomegranates.", "3": "My lover's left hand is under my head. And his right arm holds me tight!", "4": "Women of Jerusalem, promise me. Promise not to wake love. Don't excite my feelings of love until I'm ready.", "5": "Who is this coming out of the desert, leaning on her lover? I woke you under the apple tree. It was there that you were born. There your mother gave birth to you.", "6": "Put me like a seal on your heart, like a seal on your arm. Love is as strong as death. Desire is as strong as the grave. Love bursts into flames. It burns like a very hot fire.", "7": "Even much water cannot put out the flame of love. Floods cannot drown love. If a man offered everything in his house for love, people would totally reject it.", "8": "We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What should we do for our sister on the day she becomes engaged?", "9": "If she is a wall, we will put silver towers on her. If she is a door, we will protect her with cedar boards.", "10": "I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. So I was to him, as one who brings happiness.", "11": "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He rented the vineyards for others to tend. Everyone who rented had to pay pounds of silver for the fruit.", "12": "But my own vineyard is mine to give. Solomon, the 25 pounds of silver are for you. And 5 pounds are for those who tend the fruit.", "13": "You who live in the gardens, my friends are listening for your voice. Let me hear it!", "14": "Hurry, my lover. Be like a gazelle or a young deer on the mountains where spices grow."}

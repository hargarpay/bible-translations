I cry out to you about violence, but you do not save us!", "3": "Why do you let me see wrong things? Why do you put up with evil? People are destroying things and hurting others while I am looking. They are arguing and fighting.", "4": "People are not forced to obey the teachings. No one receives a fair trial. Evil people gain while good people lose. The judges no longer make fair decisions.", "5": "\u201cYou and your people, look at the nations! Watch them and be amazed. I will do something in your lifetime that will amaze you. You won't believe it even when you are told about it.", "6": "I will use the Babylonian people to punish the evil people. The Babylonians are cruel and powerful fighters. They march across the earth.

So how can you put up with those evil people? How can you be quiet when wicked people defeat people who are better than they are?", "14": "You treat people like fish in the sea. You treat them like sea animals without a leader.", "15": "The enemy catches all of them with hooks. He catches them in his net. He drags them in.

And it will destroy the strong towers of the city of Kerioth. The people of Moab will die in a great noise. They will die in the middle of sounds of war and trumpets.", "3": "So I will bring an end to the king of Moab. And I will kill all its leaders with him,\u201d says the Lord.", "4": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cFor the many crimes Judah is doing, I will punish them.

It will destroy the strong towers of Jerusalem.\u201d", "6": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cFor the many crimes Israel is doing, I will punish them.

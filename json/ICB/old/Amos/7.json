The fire dried up the deep water and destroyed the land. ", "5": "Then I cried out, \u201cLord God, stop, I beg you! No one in Israel could live through this. Israel is too small already.\u201d", "6": "So the Lord felt sorry about this. \u201cThis will not happen either,\u201d said the Lord God.", "7": "This is what the Lord showed me: The Lord stood by a straight wall.

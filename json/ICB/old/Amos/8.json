Silence!\u201d", "4": "Listen to me you who walk on helpless people. You are trying to destroy the poor people of this country.", "5": "Your businessmen say, \u201cWhen will the New Moon Festival be over so we can sell grain? When will the Sabbath be over so we can bring out wheat to sell? We can charge them more and give them less. We can change the scales to cheat the people.", "6": "We will buy poor people for silver.

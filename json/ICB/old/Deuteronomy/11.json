{"1": "Love the Lord your God. Obey his orders, rules, laws and commands. ", "2": "Remember today it was not your children who saw and felt the correction of the Lord your God. They did not see his majesty, his power and his strength. ", "3": "They did not see his signs and the things he did in Egypt to the king and his whole country. ", "4": "They did not see what he did to the Egyptian army, its horses and chariots. He drowned them in the Red Sea when they were chasing you. The Lord ruined them forever. ", "5": "They did not see what he did for you in the desert until you arrived here. ", "6": "They did not see what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite. The ground opened up and swallowed them, their families and their tents. And it swallowed up everyone who stood with them in Israel. ", "7": "It was you who saw all these great things the Lord has done.", "8": "So obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will be strong.

It is a land where much food grows. ", "10": "The land you are going to take is not like Egypt, where you were. There you had to plant your seed. Then you had to water it, like a vegetable garden, by using your feet. ", "11": "But you will soon cross the Jordan River and take the land. It is a land of hills and valleys. It drinks rain from heaven. ", "12": "It is a land the Lord your God loves. His eyes are on it continually. He watches it from the beginning of the year to the end.", "13": "Carefully obey the commands I am giving you today. Love the Lord your God. Serve him with your whole being.

", "15": "He will put grass in the fields for your cattle. You will have plenty to eat.", "16": "Be careful. Don't be fooled. Don't turn away and serve other gods. Don't worship them. ", "17": "If you do, the Lord will become angry with you. He will shut the heavens so it will not rain. Then the land will not grow crops. And you will soon die in the good land the Lord is giving you. ", "18": "Remember my words in your hearts and souls. Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign. Tie them on your foreheads to remind you. ", "19": "Teach them well to your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and walk along the road. Talk about them when you lie down and when you get up. ", "20": "Write them on your doors and gates. ", "21": "Then both you and your children will live a long time in the land. This is the land the Lord promised your ancestors. You will live there for as long as the skies are above the earth.", "22": "Be careful to obey every command I am giving you to follow. Love the Lord your God. Do what he has told you to do. And be loyal to him. ", "23": "Then the Lord will force all those nations out of the land ahead of you. And you will take the land from nations that are bigger and stronger than you. ", "24": "Everywhere you step will be yours. Your land will go from the desert to Lebanon.

He will make the people afraid everywhere you go.", "26": "See, today I am letting you choose a blessing or a curse. ", "27": "You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God. I am giving them to you today. ", "28": "But you will be cursed if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God. So do not disobey the commands I am giving you today. Do not worship other gods you do not know. ", "29": "The Lord your God will bring you into the land you will own. Then you are to announce the blessings from Mount Gerizim. Announce the curses from Mount Ebal. ", "30": "These mountains are on the other side of the Jordan River. They are west, toward the sunset. They are near the great trees of Moreh. They are in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Jordan Valley opposite Gilgal. ", "31": "You will soon cross the Jordan River. You will enter and take the land the Lord your God is giving you. You will take it over and live there. ", "32": "Then be careful to obey all the commands and laws I am giving you today."}

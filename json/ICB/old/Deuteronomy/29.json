This agreement was in addition to the agreement he had made with them at Mount Sinai.", "2": "Moses called all the Israelites together. And he said to them: You have seen everything the Lord did to the king of Egypt. You saw what he did to the king's leaders and to the whole country. ", "3": "With your own eyes you saw the great troubles, signs and miracles. ", "4": "But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands. You don't really understand what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears. ", "5": "The Lord led you through the desert for 40 years. During that time neither your clothes nor sandals wore out. ", "6": "You ate no bread. You drank no wine or beer. This was so you would understand that he is the Lord your God.", "7": "You came to this place. Then Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight us. But we defeated them. ", "8": "We captured their land. And we gave it to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh to own.", "9": "You must carefully obey everything in this agreement. Then you will succeed in everything you do.

", "18": "Make sure no man, woman, family group or tribe among you leaves the Lord. Don't let them go and serve the gods of those nations. That would be like a plant that grows bitter, poisonous fruit.", "19": "That kind of person might hear these curses. But he blesses himself. And he thinks, \u201cI will be safe. I will continue doing what I want to do.\u201d That person might destroy all of your land, both wet and dry. ", "20": "The Lord will not forgive that person. His anger will be like a burning fire against that man. All the curses written in this book will come on him. And the Lord will destroy any memory of him on the earth.

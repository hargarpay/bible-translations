No rain or dew will fall during the next few years unless I command it.\u201d", "2": "Then the Lord spoke his word to Elijah: ", "3": "\u201cLeave this place. Go east and hide near Kerith Ravine. It is east of the Jordan River. ", "4": "You may drink from the brook. And I have commanded ravens to bring you food there.\u201d ", "5": "So Elijah did what the Lord told him to do. He went to Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and lived there. ", "6": "The birds brought Elijah bread and meat every morning and every evening. And he drank water from the brook.", "7": "After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain. ", "8": "Then the Lord spoke his word to Elijah, ", "9": "\u201cGo to Zarephath in Sidon. Live there. I have commanded a widow there to take care of you.\u201d", "10": "So Elijah went to Zarephath. When he reached the town gate, he saw a widow there. She was gathering wood for a fire. Elijah asked her, \u201cWould you bring me a little water in a cup?

I have no bread. I have only a handful of flour in a jar. And I have only a little olive oil in a jug. I came here to gather some wood. I will take it home and cook our last meal. My son and I will eat it and then die from hunger.\u201d", "13": "Elijah said to her, \u201cDon't worry. Go home and cook your food as you have said.

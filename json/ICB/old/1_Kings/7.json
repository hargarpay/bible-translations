The room was covered with cedar from the floor to the ceiling. ", "8": "The palace where Solomon was to live was behind the Hall of Justice. And it was built like the Hall of Justice. Solomon also built the same kind of palace for his wife. She was the daughter of the king of Egypt.", "9": "All these buildings were made with blocks of carefully cut fine stone. Then they were trimmed with a saw in the front and back. These fine stones went from the foundations of the buildings to the top of the walls. Even the courtyard was made with blocks of stone.

", "31": "There was a frame on top of the bowls. It was 18 inches high above the bowls. The opening of the bowl was round, 27 inches deep. There were designs carved into the bronze on the frame. The frame was square, not round. ", "32": "The four wheels were under the frame. They were 27 inches high. The axles between the wheels were made as one piece with the stand.

Huram made everything King Solomon wanted. They were all made from polished bronze. ", "46": "The king ordered these things to be made near the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan. They were made by melting and pouring bronze into clay molds. ", "47": "Solomon never weighed the bronze used to make these things. There was too much to weigh. So the total weight of all the bronze was never known.", "48": "Solomon also commanded that many things be made of gold for the Temple: the golden altar; the golden table which held the bread that shows God's people are in his presence;", "49": "the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right side and five on the left side in front of the Most Holy Place); the gold flowers, lamps and tongs;", "50": "the pure gold bowls, wick trimmers, small bowls, pans and dishes used to carry coals; the hinges for the doors of the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple.", "51": "So the work King Solomon did for the Temple of the Lord was finished.

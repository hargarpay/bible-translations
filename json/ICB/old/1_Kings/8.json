This was during a festival in the month of Ethanim. That is the seventh month.", "3": "All of the elders of Israel arrived. Then the priests took up the Ark of the Covenant. ", "4": "They carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, the Meeting Tent and the holy things in it. The Levites helped the priests carry these things. ", "5": "King Solomon and all the people of Israel gathered before the Ark of the Covenant. They sacrificed so many sheep and cattle no one could count them all. ", "6": "Then the priests put the Ark of the Covenant with the Lord in its right place. This was inside the Most Holy Place in the Temple. The Ark of the Covenant was put under the wings of the golden creatures. ", "7": "The wings of the creatures were spread out over the place of the Ark of the Covenant. So they covered it and its carrying poles. ", "8": "The carrying poles were very long. Anyone standing in the Holy Place in front of the Most Holy Place could see the ends of the poles. But no one could see them from outside the Holy Place. The poles are still there today. ", "9": "The only things inside the Ark of the Covenant were two stone tablets.[a] Moses had put them in the Ark of the Covenant at Mount Sinai. That was where the Lord made his agreement with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.", "10": "When the priests left the Holy Place, the cloud filled the Temple of the Lord. ", "11": "The priests could not continue their work. This was because the Temple was filled with the glory of the Lord.", "12": "Then Solomon said, \u201cThe Lord said he would live in a dark cloud.

It will be your son, who comes from your own body. He is the one who will build my temple.'", "20": "\u201cSo the Lord has kept the promise that he gave. I am the king now in place of David my father. Now I rule Israel as the Lord promised. And I have built the Temple for worshiping the Lord, the God of Israel. ", "21": "I have made a place in the Temple for the Ark of the Covenant. Inside that Ark is the agreement the Lord made with our ancestors. He made that agreement when he brought them out of Egypt.\u201d", "22": "Then Solomon stood facing the Lord's altar. All of the people of Israel were standing behind him. He spread out his hands and looked toward the sky. ", "23": "He said: \u201cLord, God of Israel, there is no god like you. There is no god like you in heaven above or on the earth below.

And when you hear us, forgive us.", "31": "\u201cIf a person does something wrong against someone else, he will be brought to the altar in this Temple. If he swears an oath that he is not guilty, ", "32": "then hear in heaven. Judge the man. Punish the guilty person for what he has done. And declare that the innocent person is not guilty.", "33": "\u201cSometimes your people of Israel will sin against you. Because of this their enemies will defeat them. Then the people will come back to you and praise you. They will pray to you in this Temple. ", "34": "Please hear them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people Israel. Allow them to have their land again. This is the land you gave to their ancestors.", "35": "\u201cSometimes when they sin against you, you will stop the rain from falling on their land.

Hear it from your home in heaven. Then forgive the people and help them. Only you know what people are really thinking. So judge each person, and do to him what is right.

Listen to their prayers anytime they ask you for help. ", "53": "You chose them from all the nations on earth to be your very own people. This is what you promised through Moses your servant. You promised it when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, Lord God.\u201d", "54": "Solomon prayed this prayer to the Lord. He had been kneeling in front of the altar. And his arms had been raised toward heaven. When Solomon finished praying, he stood up. ", "55": "Then, in a loud voice, he blessed all the people of Israel. Solomon said: ", "56": "\u201cPraise the Lord! He promised he would give rest to his people Israel. And he has given us rest!

You must continue to obey in the future as you do now.\u201d", "62": "Then King Solomon and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to the Lord. ", "63": "Solomon killed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. These were fellowship offerings. In this way the king and the Israelites showed they had given the Temple to the Lord.", "64": "Also that day King Solomon made the courtyard before the Temple holy. He offered whole burnt sacrifices and grain offerings. He also offered the fat from the fellowship offerings. He had to make these offerings in the courtyard. This was because the bronze altar before the Lord was too small. It could not hold all the offerings.", "65": "So King Solomon and all the people of Israel also celebrated the other festival that came at that time. People came from as far away as Lebo Hamath in the north. And they came from as far as the brook of Egypt in the south. A great many people were there. They ate, drank and rejoiced before the Lord for a total of 14 days. ", "66": "On the following day Solomon sent the people home. So they blessed the king and went home. They were happy because of all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and for his people, Israel."}

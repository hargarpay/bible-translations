When Jeroboam heard about Rehoboam being made king, Jeroboam returned from Egypt. ", "3": "So the people sent for him. Then he and the people went to Rehoboam. They said to Rehoboam, ", "4": "\u201cYour father forced us to work very hard. Now, make it easier for us. Don't make us work as hard as your father did. Then we will serve you.\u201d", "5": "Rehoboam answered, \u201cCome back to me in three days. Then I will answer you.\u201d So the people left.", "6": "Some of the elders had helped Solomon make decisions during his lifetime. So King Rehoboam asked them what he should do. He said, \u201cHow do you think I should answer these people?\u201d", "7": "They answered, \u201cYou should be like a servant to them today. Serve them, and give them a kind answer. If you do, they will serve you always.\u201d", "8": "But Rehoboam did not listen to this advice. He asked the young men who had grown up with him. They advised him in making decisions.

What is your advice?\u201d", "10": "The young men answered, \u201cThose people came to you and said, 'Your father forced us to work very hard. Now make our work easier.'

He did this to keep the promise he had made to Jeroboam son of Nebat. He had made this promise through Ahijah, the prophet from Shiloh.", "16": "All the people of Israel saw that the new king refused to listen to them. So they said to the king, \u201cWe have no share in David! We have no part in the son of Jesse! People of Israel, let's go to our own homes! Let David's son rule his own people!\u201d So the Israelites went home.

The Lord said, ", "23": "\u201cTalk to Solomon's son Rehoboam, the king of Judah. Talk also to all the people of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people. ", "24": "Say to them, 'The Lord says you must not go to war against your brothers, the Israelites. Every one of you should go home. I made all these things happen!'\u201d So the men in Rehoboam's army obeyed the Lord's command. They all went home as the Lord had commanded.", "25": "Then Jeroboam made Shechem a very strong city. It is in the mountains of Ephraim. And Jeroboam lived there. He also went to the city of Peniel and made it stronger.", "26": "Jeroboam said to himself, \u201cThe kingdom will probably go back to David's family.

This was like the festival in Judah. During that time the king offered sacrifices on the altar. He offered sacrifices to the calves in Bethel he had made. He also chose priests in Bethel to serve at the places of worship he had made. ", "33": "So Jeroboam chose his own time for a festival for the Israelites. It was the fifteenth day of the eighth month. During that time he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built in Bethel. So he set up a festival for the Israelites. And he offered sacrifices on the altar."}

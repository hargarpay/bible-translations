Achish said to David, \u201cYou understand that you and your men must join with me in my army.\u201d", "2": "David answered, \u201cCertainly! Then you can see for yourself what I, your servant, can do!\u201d Achish said, \u201cFine, I'll make you my bodyguard for life.\u201d", "3": "Now Samuel was dead, and all the Israelites had shown their sadness for him. They had buried Samuel in his hometown of Ramah. And Saul had forced out the mediums and fortune-tellers from the land of Israel.", "4": "The Philistines came together and made camp at Shunem. Saul gathered all the Israelites and made camp at Gilboa. ", "5": "When he saw the Philistine army, he was afraid. His heart pounded with fear.

I'll go and ask her what will happen.\u201d His servants answered, \u201cThere is a medium in Endor.\u201d", "8": "Then Saul put on other clothes so no one would know who he was. At night Saul and two of his men went to see the woman. Saul said to her, \u201cTalk to a spirit for me. Call up the person I name.\u201d", "9": "But the woman said to him, \u201cSurely you know what Saul has done. He has forced the mediums and fortune-tellers out from the land of Israel. You are trying to trap me and kill me.\u201d", "10": "Saul made a promise to the woman in the name of the Lord.

What do you see?\u201d The woman said, \u201cI see a spirit coming up out of the ground.\u201d", "14": "Saul asked, \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d The woman answered, \u201cAn old man wearing a coat is coming up.\u201d Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed facedown on the ground.", "15": "Samuel asked Saul, \u201cWhy have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\u201d Saul said, \u201cI am greatly troubled. The Philistines are fighting against me. God has left me. He won't answer me anymore, either by prophets or in dreams. That's why I called you. I want you to tell me what to do.\u201d", "16": "Samuel said, \u201cThe Lord has left you. He has become your enemy. So why do you call on me? ", "17": "He has done what he said he would do. He said these things through me. He has torn the kingdom out of your hands. He has given it to one of your neighbors, David. ", "18": "You did not obey the Lord. You did not show the Amalekites how angry he was with them. That's why he has done this to you today. ", "19": "The Lord will give both Israel and you to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will let the Philistines defeat the army of Israel.\u201d", "20": "Saul quickly fell to the ground and lay there. He was afraid because of what Samuel had said. He was also very weak because he had eaten nothing all that day and night.", "21": "Then the woman came to Saul. She saw that he was really frightened. She said, \u201cLook, I, your servant, have obeyed you. I have risked my life and done what you told me to do. ", "22": "Now please listen to me. Let me give you some food. Then you may eat and have enough strength to go on your way.\u201d", "23": "But Saul refused. He said, \u201cI won't eat.\u201d His servants joined the woman in asking him to eat. And he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.", "24": "The woman had a fat calf at the house. She quickly killed it. She took some flour and mixed dough with her hands. Then she baked some bread without yeast. ", "25": "She put the food before them, and they ate. Then that same night they got up and left."}

{"1": "Open your doors, O Lebanon, so the fire can consume your cedar.", "2": "Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen; the majestic trees are destroyed. Wail, O oaks of Bashan, because the unassailable forest has been brought down.", "3": "There is the sound of wailing shepherds, because their glory is ruined. There is the sound of roaring lions, because the pride of Jordan is ruined.", "4": "Thus says the Lord my God: Shepherd the flock of slaughter. ", "5": "The ones who buy them then slaughter them and have no guilt, and those who sell them say, \u201cBlessed is the Lord because I am rich.\u201d Their own shepherds do not take pity on them. ", "6": "For I will no longer have pity on those who dwell in the land, says the Lord. But I will cause each of them to fall into the hands of his neighbor, even into the hands of his king. They will crush the land, and I will not deliver any from their hands.", "7": "So I shepherded the flock that was for slaughter, even the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs. One I called Favor and the other I gave the name Union. So I pastured the flock. ", "8": "I destroyed the three shepherds in the span of one month. For my soul was impatient with them, and their souls detested me. ", "9": "Then I said, \u201cI will not shepherd you. What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. Let those who are left devour each other's flesh.\u201d", "10": "I took the staff named Favor and cut it into pieces, to break the covenant that I made with all the peoples. ", "11": "So it was broken that day, and the afflicted of the flock were watching me and knew that this was the word of the Lord.", "12": "Then I said to them, \u201cIf this is good in your eyes, then give my wages to me, but if not, then keep it.\u201d They weighed my wages at thirty pieces of silver.", "13": "Then the Lord said to me, \u201cThrow it to the potter, the splendid price by which I was valued by them.\u201d So I took the thirty silver pieces and threw them to the house of the Lord to the potter.", "14": "Then I cut up the second staff, Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.", "15": "Then the Lord said to me: Take for yourself again the vessels carried by a foolish shepherd. ", "16": "I am raising up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are perishing, nor seek the young, nor heal the broken, nor feed those who are standing still. But he will eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hoofs in pieces.", "17": "Woe to this worthless shepherd who abandons his flock. May the sword take his arm and right eye; may his arm surely wither up, and his right eye become blind."}

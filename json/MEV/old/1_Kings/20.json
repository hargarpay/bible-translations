See, I will deliver it into your hand this day, and you shall know that I am the Lord.\u201d", "14": "Ahab asked, \u201cBy whom?\u201d And he said, \u201cThus says the Lord: By the young leaders of the provinces.\u201d Then he said, \u201cWho shall order the battle?\u201d And he answered, \u201cYou.\u201d", "15": "Then he counted the young leaders of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two, and after them he counted all the people, all the children of Israel, and had seven thousand.

That is why they were stronger than us, but if we fight against them in the plain, we will surely be stronger than they. ", "24": "Do this: Dismiss the kings, each from his position, and put commanders in their places, ", "25": "and assemble an army like the army that you lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and we will fight them in the plain and will surely be stronger than they.\u201d And he listened to their advice and followed it.", "26": "The next year Ben-Hadad assembled the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. ", "27": "The children of Israel were assembled and were all present, and they went against them, and the children of Israel camped in front of them like two little flocks of kids, while the Arameans filled the country.", "28": "A man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel and said, \u201cThus says the Lord: Because the Arameans have said, 'The Lord is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys,' I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord.\u201d", "29": "They camped opposite each other for seven days, and on the seventh day, the battle was joined. The children of Israel killed a hundred thousand Aramean footmen in one day. ", "30": "But the rest fled into the city of Aphek, where a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. And Ben-Hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber.", "31": "His servants said to him, \u201cWe have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.\u201d", "32": "So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of Israel and said, \u201cYour servant Ben-Hadad says, 'Please let me live.'\u202f\u201d And he said, \u201cIs he still alive? He is my brother!\u201d", "33": "Now the men were diligently looking for a positive sign and quickly took hold of it, and they said, \u201cYour brother Ben-Hadad!\u201d Then he said, \u201cGo. You bring him.\u201d Then Ben-Hadad came to him and got into the chariot.", "34": "Ben-Hadad said to him, \u201cI will restore the cities which my father took from your father, and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.\u201d Then Ahab said, \u201cI will send you away with this covenant.\u201d So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.", "35": "Speaking in the word of the Lord, a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor, \u201cStrike me, please.\u201d But the man refused to strike him.", "36": "Then he said to him, \u201cBecause you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.\u201d And as soon as he left him, a lion found and killed him.", "37": "Then he found another man and said, \u201cStrike me, please.\u201d And the man struck him so that he was wounded.

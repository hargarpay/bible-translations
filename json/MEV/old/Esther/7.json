", "2": "The king repeated to Esther what he had said on the previous day while drinking wine, \u201cFor what are you asking, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. Now, what is your request? Even if it is half of the kingdom, it will be done!\u201d", "3": "Queen Esther replied, \u201cIf I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, at my petition, let my life be given me, and my people at my request. ", "4": "For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be annihilated. If only we had been sold as male and female slaves, I could have kept quiet, for that distress would not be sufficient to trouble the king.\u201d", "5": "Then King Ahasuerus answered and demanded of Queen Esther, \u201cWho is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do so?\u201d", "6": "Esther said, \u201cThis wicked Haman is the adversary and enemy!\u201d Then Haman was seized with terror before the king and the queen.

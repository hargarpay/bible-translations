", "3": "You shall prepare a roadway for yourself, and divide the territory of your land into three parts, which the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, so that every manslayer may flee there.", "4": "This is the word concerning the manslayer who will flee there, so that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, whom he did not hate previously, ", "5": "like when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand raises the axe to cut down the tree, and the axe head slips from the handle and lands on his neighbor causing him to die, then he may flee to one of those cities, and live. ", "6": "Otherwise the avenger of blood might, while he is angry, pursue the manslayer and overtake him (because the way is long) and kill him, even though he was not worthy of death (since he did not hate him previously). ", "7": "Therefore, I command you, saying, \u201cYou shall set apart three cities for yourselves.\u201d", "8": "If the Lord your God enlarges your borders as He promised your fathers, and gives you all the land which He promised to give to your fathers, ", "9": "and if you will carefully keep all these commandments, which I command you today, to love the Lord your God, and to always walk in His ways, then you must add three cities more for yourself, besides these three.

In this way you must remove the evil from among you. ", "20": "Those who remain will hear and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you. ", "21": "You must not show pity. But life will be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."}

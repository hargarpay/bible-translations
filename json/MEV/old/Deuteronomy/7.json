You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them. ", "3": "What is more, you shall not intermarry with them. You shall not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. ", "4": "For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will be inflamed against you, and He will quickly destroy you. ", "5": "But this is how you shall deal with them: You shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their Asherim[a] and burn their graven images with fire. ", "6": "For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be His special people, treasured above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.", "7": "The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all the peoples.

The Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

", "13": "He will love you and bless you and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain, and your wine, and your oil, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your fathers to give you. ", "14": "You shall be blessed above all peoples. There will not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock. ", "15": "The Lord will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, but will lay them on all those who hate you. ", "16": "You must consume all the peoples whom the Lord your God will deliver to you. Your eye shall have no pity on them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you.", "17": "If you say in your heart, \u201cThese nations are greater than I\u2014how can I dispossess them?\u201d ", "18": "you shall not be afraid of them.

", "24": "He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you may erase their names from under heaven. No man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them. ", "25": "You must burn the graven images of their gods with fire. You must not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take any of it, lest you be snared by them, for it is an abomination to the Lord your God. ", "26": "You shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you become cursed like it, but you must absolutely detest and abhor it, for it is a cursed thing."}

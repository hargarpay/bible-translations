{"1": "David mustered the people who were with him, and he set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. ", "2": "Then David dispatched the people, one-third under the command of Joab, one-third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, and one-third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. Then David said to the people, \u201cI myself will go out with you.\u201d", "3": "But the people said, \u201cYou should not go, for if we retreat, they will not be concerned about us. Even if half of us die, they will not be concerned about us. But now you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore, it would be better to assist us from the city.\u201d", "4": "The king said to them, \u201cI will do what seems best to you.\u201d So the king stood beside the gate while all of the people went out by hundreds and thousands. ", "5": "The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, \u201cDeal gently with the young man Absalom.\u201d All of the people heard the king instruct the commanders concerning Absalom.", "6": "So the people went out toward Israel in the field, but the fighting occurred in the forest of Ephraim. ", "7": "The people of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David. That day the defeat was extensive, twenty thousand men. ", "8": "The fighting spread across the land, and the people consumed by the forest were more numerous than those consumed by the sword that day.", "9": "Absalom was encountered by some of the servants of David. Now Absalom was riding on his mule. When the mule went under the branches of a very large tree, his head was caught in the tree. He was left in midair while the mule that was under him kept going.", "10": "One man saw him and reported it to Joab, saying, \u201cI saw Absalom hanging in a tree.\u201d", "11": "Joab said to the man who was reporting to him, \u201cWhat? You saw him? Why did you not strike him on the spot, sending him to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels[a] of silver and a belt.\u201d", "12": "The man said to Joab, \u201cNot even if I had felt the weight of a thousand shekels[b] of silver in my hand would I have laid a hand on the king's son. In our hearing the king commanded you, Abishai, and Ittai saying: Beware lest anyone touch the young man Absalom! ", "13": "Otherwise, I would have worked falsehood against my own life. For nothing is hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.\u201d", "14": "Then Joab said, \u201cI will not waste any more time with you.\u201d He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the midst of the tree. ", "15": "Then ten young men, armor bearers for Joab, gathered around and struck down Absalom, killing him.", "16": "When Joab blew the horn, the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab held back the people. ", "17": "Then they took Absalom, disposed of him in a large pit in the forest, and piled over him a very large heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his home.", "18": "Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a memorial stone in the Valley of the King, for he said, \u201cI have no son by whom my name may be remembered.\u201d So he named the memorial stone after himself; and to this day, it is called the monument of Absalom.", "19": "Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, \u201cAllow me to run and bring the news to the king that the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.\u201d", "20": "But Joab said to him, \u201cYou will not be a man who bears news today; you may bear news another day. Today you will not bear news because the king's son is dead.\u201d", "21": "Then Joab said to the Cushite, \u201cGo, report to the king what you have seen.\u201d The Cushite bowed to Joab, then ran off.", "22": "Ahimaaz again said to Joab, \u201cWhatever may happen, let me run also, after the Cushite.\u201d Then Joab said, \u201cWhy is it that you want to run, my son? There is no messenger's reward for you to obtain.\u201d", "23": "\u201cWhatever happens, I want to run.\u201d So he said to him, \u201cRun.\u201d So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed the Cushite.", "24": "Now David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gate, to the city wall. He lifted his eyes and saw a man running by himself. ", "25": "The watchman called and told the king. The king said, \u201cIf he is alone, there is news in his mouth.\u201d And he came ever closer.", "26": "Then the watchman saw another man running. The watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, \u201cLook there is another man running alone.\u201d The king said, \u201cHe also is bringing news.\u201d", "27": "The watchman said, \u201cI think that the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz.\u201d The king said, \u201cHe is a good man and comes with good news.\u201d", "28": "Then Ahimaaz called to the king and said, \u201cAll is well.\u201d He bowed down to the ground before the king and said, \u201cBlessed be the Lord your God who has handed over the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.\u201d", "29": "The king said, \u201cIs it well for the young man Absalom?\u201d Ahimaaz said, \u201cI saw a great commotion when Joab sent the servant of the king, your servant, but I do not know what it was.\u201d", "30": "The king said, \u201cStep aside and stand here.\u201d So he stepped aside and stood in position.", "31": "Then the Cushite came and said, \u201cGood news for my lord the king, for today the Lord has delivered you from those who rose up against you.\u201d", "32": "The king said to the Cushite, \u201cIs it well for the young man Absalom?\u201d The Cushite said, \u201cMay the enemies of my lord the king and all who would rise up against you to do harm become as the young man is.\u201d", "33": "The king was deeply moved and went up to the upper chamber of the gate and wept. As he went he said, \u201cO my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I could have given my death in your stead, Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d"}

{"1": "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.", "2": "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. For the Lord has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me;", "3": "the ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib, but Israel does not know; My people do not consider.", "4": "Alas, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a brood of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are estranged and backward.", "5": "Why should you be beaten again, that you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.", "6": "From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it. Wounds, bruises, and open sores; they have not been closed, nor bandaged, nor soothed with oil.", "7": "Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; strangers devour your land in your presence; and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.", "8": "The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.", "9": "Unless the Lord of Hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah.", "10": "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah:", "11": "For what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? says the Lord. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed animals. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats.", "12": "When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?", "13": "Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to Me. New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations\u2014 I cannot bear with evil assemblies.", "14": "My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts; they are a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.", "15": "When you reach out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; even when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.", "16": "Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil from your deeds, from before My eyes. Cease to do evil,", "17": "learn to do good; seek justice, relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.", "18": "Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.", "19": "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;", "20": "but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.", "21": "How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.", "22": "Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.", "23": "Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves; everyone loves a bribe and follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow come before them.", "24": "Therefore the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, says: Ah, I will get relief from My adversaries, and avenge Myself on My enemies.", "25": "And I will turn My hand against you, thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your impurities.", "26": "I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.", "27": "Zion shall be redeemed with justice and her converts with righteousness.", "28": "But the destruction of the transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.", "29": "For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be humiliated for the gardens that you have chosen.", "30": "For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.", "31": "The strong shall be as tinder, and his work like a spark; they will both burn together, and no one will quench them."}

{"1": "O Lord, You are my God. I will exalt You, I will praise Your name, for You have done wonderful things; Your plans formed of old are faithfulness and truth.", "2": "For You have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin; a palace of strangers is a city no longer; it shall never be built.", "3": "Therefore a strong people shall glorify You; cities of ruthless nations shall fear You.", "4": "For You have been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat; for the breath of the ruthless ones is as a storm against the wall.", "5": "You bring down the noise of strangers, as heat in drought; as the heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless ones shall be brought low.", "6": "In this mountain the Lord of Hosts shall prepare for all people a lavish feast, a feast of aged wines, choice pieces full of marrow, and refined, aged wines.", "7": "He will destroy in this mountain the covering which is over all peoples, even the veil that is spread over all nations.", "8": "He will swallow up death for all time, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces; and the reproach of His people He shall take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken it.", "9": "It shall be said in that day: Look, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.", "10": "For in this mountain the hand of the Lord shall rest, and Moab shall be trodden down in his place as straw is trodden down in the water for the manure pile.", "11": "He shall spread out his hands in the midst of it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim, yet the Lord shall bring down his pride together with the trickery of his hands.", "12": "The unassailable fortresses of your walls He shall bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust."}

{"1": "The oracle of Moab. Surely in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence, surely in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence,", "2": "he has gone up to the temple and to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall wail over Nebo and over Medeba; on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.", "3": "In their streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets, everyone shall wail, weeping abundantly.", "4": "Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh; their voice shall be heard even to Jahaz; therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous to him.", "5": "My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee to Zoar, like a three-year-old heifer. For by the Ascent of Luhith they shall go up with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction,", "6": "for the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; surely the grass is withered away; the grass fails, there is no green thing.", "7": "Therefore the abundance they have gained, and that which they have laid up, they shall carry away to the Brook of the Willows.", "8": "For the cry has gone all around the borders of Moab; its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.", "9": "For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood; for I will bring more woes on Dimon, lions on the fugitives of Moab, and on the remnant of the land."}

{"1": "In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple. ", "2": "Above it stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. ", "3": "One cried to another and said: \u201cHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.\u201d", "4": "The posts of the door moved at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.", "5": "And I said: \u201cWoe is me! For I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.\u201d", "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar in his hand. ", "7": "And he laid it on my mouth, and said, \u201cThis has touched your lips, and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.\u201d", "8": "Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?\u201d Then I said, \u201cHere am I. Send me.\u201d", "9": "He said, \u201cGo, and tell this people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'", "10": "Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn and be healed.\u201d", "11": "Then I said, \u201cLord, how long?\u201d And He answered: \u201cUntil the cities are laid waste without inhabitants, and the houses without man, and the land is utterly desolate,", "12": "and the Lord has removed men far away, and there is a great forsaking in the midst of the land.", "13": "But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be burned, as a terebinth tree or as an oak, whose stump remains when it is cut down, so the holy seed is its stump.\u201d"}

Those who rule over them make them wail, says the Lord, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long.", "6": "Therefore, My people shall know My name; therefore, they shall know in that day that I am He who does speak: Here I am.", "7": "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings good news of happiness, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, \u201cYour God reigns!\u201d", "8": "Your watchmen lift up their voices; they sing joyfully together; for they shall see with their own eyes when the Lord brings Zion back.", "9": "Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem.

Kings shall shut their mouths at him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall consider."}

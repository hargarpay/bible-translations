Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste so that there is no house or harbor; from the land of Cyprus it is reported to them.", "2": "Be still, you inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon; your messengers passed over the sea,", "3": "and were on many waters; the grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River[a] was her revenue; and she was the market of nations.", "4": "Be ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea has spoken, even the stronghold of the sea, saying, \u201cI have not travailed nor brought forth children; neither have I brought up young men nor raised virgins.\u201d", "5": "When the report reaches Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.", "6": "Pass over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coastland.", "7": "Is this your joyous city, whose origin is from ancient days, whose feet used to carry her to sojourn in distant locations?", "8": "Who has planned this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?", "9": "The Lord of Hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.", "10": "Pass through your land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more restraint.", "11": "He stretched out His hand over the sea, He shook the kingdoms; the Lord has given a command against the merchant city, to destroy its strongholds.", "12": "He said: You shall rejoice no more, O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon.

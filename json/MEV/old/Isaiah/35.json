For in the wilderness waters shall break out and streams in the desert.", "7": "The parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of jackals where each lay, there shall be grass with reeds and rushes.", "8": "A highway shall be there, a roadway, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass on it, but it shall be for the wayfaring men, and fools shall not wander on it.", "9": "No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up on it; these shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there,", "10": "and the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."}

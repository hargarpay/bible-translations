When the Lord shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall and he who is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.", "4": "For thus the Lord has spoken to me: Like the lion, and the young lion, roars over his prey, against which a multitude of shepherds is called out against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor disturbed at their noise, so shall the Lord of Hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for its hill.", "5": "Like flying birds, so the Lord of Hosts will defend Jerusalem. He will defend and deliver it; He will pass over and preserve it.", "6": "Turn to Him whom you have deeply betrayed, O sons of Israel. ", "7": "For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made for you as a sin.", "8": "\u201cThen the Assyrian shall fall by the sword that is not of man, and the sword not of man shall devour him. So he shall not escape the sword, and his young men shall become forced laborers.", "9": "He shall cross over to his stronghold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the banner,\u201d says the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem."}

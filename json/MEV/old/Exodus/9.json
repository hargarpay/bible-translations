There shall be a very grievous pestilence. ", "4": "The Lord shall separate between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.'\u202f\u201d", "5": "So the Lord appointed a set time, saying, \u201cTomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.\u201d ", "6": "Then the Lord did this thing the next day, so that all the livestock of Egypt died, but not one of the livestock of the children of Israel died. ", "7": "Pharaoh sent, and there was not one of the livestock of the children of Israel dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, so that he did not let the people go.", "8": "Then the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, \u201cTake for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a kiln, and let Moses toss it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh. ", "9": "It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blisters upon man and beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.\u201d", "10": "So they took the ashes from a kiln and stood before Pharaoh. Then Moses tossed it up toward the heavens, and it became a boil breaking forth with blisters upon man and beast.

Every man and beast which shall be found in the field and not brought home when the hail comes down upon them will die.'\u202f\u201d", "20": "He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses.

So the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt. ", "24": "So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail. It was so severe that there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

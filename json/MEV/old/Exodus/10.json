Let My people go, that they may serve Me. ", "4": "For if you refuse to let My people go, indeed, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. ", "5": "And they shall cover the face of the earth, such that no one will be able to see the earth. What's more, they shall eat the remainder of that which has escaped\u2014that which remains to you from the hail\u2014and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.

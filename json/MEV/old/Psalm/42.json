{"1": "As the deer pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after You, O God.", "2": "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When will I come and appear before God?", "3": "My tears have been my food day and night, while they always say to me, \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d", "4": "When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me. For I would travel with the throng of people; I proceeded with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and thanks, with a multitude making a pilgrimage.", "5": "Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted in me? Hope in God, for I will yet thank Him for the help of His presence.", "6": "O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember You from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermon, from the hill of Mizar.", "7": "Deep calls to deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows passed over me.", "8": "Yet the Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night His song will be with me, a prayer to the God of my life.", "9": "I will say to God, my rock, \u201cWhy have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?\u201d", "10": "With shattering in my bones, those harassing me reproach me, when they say to me every day, \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d", "11": "Why, my soul, are you cast down? Why do you groan within me? Wait for God; I will yet thank Him, For He is my deliverance and my God."}

{"1": "Lord, who will abide in Your tabernacle? Who will dwell in Your holy hill?", "2": "He who walks uprightly, and does righteousness, and speaks truth in his heart;", "3": "he who does not slander with the tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor bears a reproach against his friend;", "4": "in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to avoid evil and does not change;", "5": "he who does not put his money out to usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be moved."}

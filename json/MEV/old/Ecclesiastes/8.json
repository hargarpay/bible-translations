A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the harshness of his face is softened.", "2": "I say, \u201cKeep the king's command, because of your oath to God. ", "3": "Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not take a stand in an unpleasant matter, for he does whatever pleases him.\u201d ", "4": "For the word of the king is powerful, and who would say to him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "5": "He who keeps his command will know no evil thing; and a wise heart will know the appropriate time and just way.", "6": "For to every matter there is an appropriate time and just way, though a man's distress weighs heavily on him.", "7": "For he does not know what will happen; for who can declare to him what will occur?", "8": "There is not a man with mastery over the wind to restrain it, nor with power over the day of death.

{"1": "There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind: ", "2": "a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor so that there is no want in his life from among anything that he desires; yet God does not give him ability to eat from them because another man eats and enjoys from his possessions. This is vanity and a tormenting injustice.", "3": "If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things, and he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he\u2014 ", "4": "for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered up. ", "5": "Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds rest rather than he. ", "6": "Though the man may live a thousand years, twice over, yet he does not see the good things. Does not everyone go to the same place?", "7": "All the labor of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.", "8": "For what benefit is there for the wise over the fool? And what more does the poor man know who walks before others?", "9": "Better to be content with the sight of eyes than to have a wandering appetite. This is vanity and like chasing the wind.", "10": "Whatever happens, it has already been given a name, and it is known what man is; he cannot contend with Him who is stronger than he.", "11": "The more words, the more vanity, so what profit is there to mankind?", "12": "For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life which pass like a shadow? For who can tell men what will be after them under the sun?"}

", "3": "Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He had rested from all His work which He had created and made.", "4": "This is the account[a] of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, ", "5": "no shrub of the field was yet on the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground. ", "6": "But a mist[b] arose from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. ", "7": "Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being.", "8": "The Lord God planted a garden in the east, in Eden, and there He placed the man whom He had formed. ", "9": "Out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, along with the tree of knowledge of good and evil.", "10": "A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it parted and became four rivers.

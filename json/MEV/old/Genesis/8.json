In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.", "6": "Then at the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made, ", "7": "and he sent forth a raven, which went to and fro until the waters were dried up on the earth. ", "8": "Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. ", "9": "But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were on the surface of all the earth.

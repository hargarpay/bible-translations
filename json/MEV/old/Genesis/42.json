Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.\u201d", "3": "Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. ", "4": "But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers for he said, \u201cPerhaps some harm might happen to him.\u201d ", "5": "Thus the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.", "6": "Now Joseph was the governor over the land, and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. So Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves down before him with their faces to the ground. ", "7": "Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them and spoke harshly to them. He said to them, \u201cFrom where do you come?\u201d And they said, \u201cFrom the land of Canaan to buy food.\u201d", "8": "Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him. ", "9": "Joseph also remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. He said to them, \u201cYou are spies! You came to see the nakedness of the land!\u201d", "10": "They said to him, \u201cNo, my lord, your servants have come only to buy food. ", "11": "We are all one man's sons. We are honest men. Your servants are not spies.\u201d", "12": "But he said to them, \u201cNo, you have come to see the nakedness of the land!\u201d", "13": "They said, \u201cYour servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer living.\u201d", "14": "Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is as I said to you, 'You are spies!' ", "15": "Here is how you will be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you will not leave here unless your youngest brother comes here. ", "16": "Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested, whether there be any truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, you are surely spies.\u201d ", "17": "He put them all together in custody for three days.", "18": "Joseph said to them the third day, \u201cDo this and live, for I fear God.

And it was done for them.", "26": "They loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.", "27": "As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed in the lodging place, he saw his money. It was in the mouth of his sack. ", "28": "And he said to his brothers, \u201cMy money has been returned. Here it is in my sack!\u201d Then their hearts sank, and they were afraid, saying to one another, \u201cWhat is this that God has done to us?\u201d", "29": "They came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying, ", "30": "\u201cThe man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and took us for spies of the country.

One is no longer living, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.'", "33": "\u201cThe man, the lord of the country, said to us, 'Here is how I may know that you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your households, and be gone. ", "34": "But bring your youngest brother back to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. Then I will deliver your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.'\u202f\u201d", "35": "As they emptied their sacks, every man's bundle of money was in his sack.

Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.\u201d", "37": "Reuben spoke to his father, saying, \u201cKill my two sons if I fail to bring him to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.\u201d", "38": "But Jacob said, \u201cMy son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should happen to him on the journey you are to make, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\u201d"}

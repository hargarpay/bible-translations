", "2": "Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, along with his grain money.\u201d And he did according to what Joseph had spoken.", "3": "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. ", "4": "When they were gone out of the city, but not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, \u201cGet up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good? ", "5": "Is this not the one from which my lord drinks and uses as he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.'\u202f\u201d", "6": "So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words. ", "7": "They said to him, \u201cWhy does my lord say these words? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing. ", "8": "Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found in the top of our sacks. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your lord's house? ", "9": "Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves.\u201d", "10": "He said, \u201cNow let it also be according to your words. He with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you will be blameless.\u201d", "11": "Then every man hurriedly took down his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack. ", "12": "He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack. ", "13": "Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.", "14": "When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him. ", "15": "Joseph said to them, \u201cWhat deed is this that you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?\u201d", "16": "And Judah said, \u201cWhat shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Here we are, my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose possession the cup was found.\u201d", "17": "But he said, \u201cFar be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose possession the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.\u201d", "18": "Then Judah approached him and said, \u201cO my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not be angry with your servant, for you are equal to Pharaoh. ", "19": "My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?' ", "20": "And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age.

", "23": "You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'

If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down, for we may not see the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.'", "27": "\u201cYour servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.

", "32": "For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I fail to bring him to you, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.'", "33": "\u201cNow therefore, please let your servant stay as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers. ", "34": "For how can I go up to my father if the boy is not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would find my father?\u201d"}

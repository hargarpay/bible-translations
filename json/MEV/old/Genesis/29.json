", "3": "When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds rolled the stone from the well's opening, watered the sheep, then put the stone back on the well's opening in its place.", "4": "Jacob said to them, \u201cMy brothers, where are you from?\u201d And they said, \u201cWe are from Harran.\u201d", "5": "Then he said to them, \u201cDo you know Laban the son of Nahor?\u201d And they said, \u201cWe know him.\u201d", "6": "He said to them, \u201cIs he well?\u201d And they said, \u201cHe is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.\u201d", "7": "He said, \u201cSince it is yet midday, it is not the time that the livestock should be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.\u201d", "8": "They said, \u201cWe cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the well's opening. Then we may water the sheep.\u201d", "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.

Then Jacob told Laban all these things. ", "14": "Laban said to him, \u201cSurely you are my bone and my flesh.\u201d And he stayed with him for a month. ", "15": "Laban said to Jacob, \u201cSince you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?\u201d", "16": "Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. ", "17": "Leah's eyes were tender, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.

", "32": "Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, \u201cSurely the Lord has looked upon my affliction. Now therefore my husband will love me.\u201d", "33": "She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, \u201cBecause the Lord has heard that I was unloved, He has therefore given me this son also.\u201d Then she called his name Simeon.", "34": "She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, \u201cNow this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.\u201d Therefore his name was called Levi.", "35": "She conceived again and gave birth to a son, and she said, \u201cNow I will praise the Lord!\u201d Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped giving birth."}

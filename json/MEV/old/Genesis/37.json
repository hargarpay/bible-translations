Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers, and the boy was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.", "3": "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors.[a] ", "4": "But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.", "5": "Now Joseph dreamed a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cPlease listen to this dream which I have dreamed. ", "7": "We were binding sheaves in the field. All of a sudden my sheaf rose up and stood upright, and your sheaves stood around it and bowed down to my sheaf.\u201d", "8": "His brothers said to him, \u201cWill you really reign over us, or will you really have dominion over us?\u201d So they hated him even more because of his dreams and his words.", "9": "Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, \u201cI have dreamed another dream. The sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing to me.\u201d", "10": "But when he told it to his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, \u201cWhat is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers really come to bow down ourselves to you to the ground?\u201d ", "11": "So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.", "12": "Now his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

The man asked him, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d", "16": "And he said, \u201cI am looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks.\u201d", "17": "The man said, \u201cThey have departed from here. I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'\u202f\u201d So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.", "18": "When they saw him some distance away, before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.", "19": "They said one to another, \u201cThe master of dreams comes!

", "24": "And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty, and there was no water in it.", "25": "Then they sat down to eat. And looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, carrying it down to Egypt.", "26": "Then Judah said to his brothers, \u201cWhat profit is it if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? ", "27": "Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us not lay our hand on him, for he is our brother and our own flesh.\u201d So his brothers agreed.", "28": "Then when the Midianite merchants passed by, they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver.[b] They took Joseph to Egypt.", "29": "When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes. ", "30": "He returned to his brothers, and said, \u201cThe boy is not there, and I, where can I go?\u201d", "31": "They took Joseph's coat and killed a young goat and dipped the coat in the blood. ", "32": "Then they took the coat of many colors and brought it to their father and said, \u201cThis we have found. Do you know whether it is your son's robe or not?\u201d", "33": "He knew it and said, \u201cIt is my son's coat. A wild beast has devoured him. Joseph has without a doubt been torn into pieces.\u201d", "34": "Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his waist and mourned for his son many days. ", "35": "All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, \u201cFor I will go down into the grave mourning for my son.\u201d So his father wept for him.", "36": "Meanwhile the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard."}

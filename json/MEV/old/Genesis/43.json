For the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'\u202f\u201d", "6": "Israel said, \u201cWhy did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?\u201d", "7": "And they said, \u201cThe man asked us directly about ourselves and our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' So we answered his questions. How could we even know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?\u201d", "8": "And Judah said to Israel his father, \u201cSend the boy with me, and we will arise and go, so that we may live and not die, both we and you, and also our little ones.

{"1": "And now, O priests, this commandment is for you. ", "2": "If you will not listen, and if you will not take it to heart to give honor to My name, says the Lord of Hosts, I will send a curse on you and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have cursed them already, because you do not take it to heart.", "3": "I rebuke your descendants, and spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your solemn feasts, and you will be taken away with it. ", "4": "And you will know that I have sent this command to you, that My covenant with Levi may remain, says the Lord of Hosts. ", "5": "My covenant with him was for life and peace, and I gave them to him. With awe he feared Me, and he was reverent before My name. ", "6": "True instruction was in his mouth, and injustice was not found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and with uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.", "7": "For a priest's lips should preserve knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts. ", "8": "But you have departed from the way. You have caused many to stumble at the law. You have violated the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of Hosts. ", "9": "So I have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because you have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in the law.", "10": "Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?", "11": "Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the Lord, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. ", "12": "May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man who does this, teacher and student, yet who brings an offering to the Lord of Hosts.", "13": "This is the second thing you do: You cover the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping and crying out, because He no longer regards the offering, nor receives it with good will from your hand. ", "14": "Yet you say, \u201cWhy?\u201d It is because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously. Yet she is your companion and your wife by covenant.", "15": "Did He not make them one, having a remnant of the Spirit? And why one? He seeks godly offspring. So take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.", "16": "For the Lord, the God of Israel, says that He hates divorce; for it covers one's garment with violence, says the Lord of Hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.", "17": "You have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet you say, \u201cHow have we wearied Him?\u201d When you say, \u201cEveryone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and He delights in them,\u201d or, \u201cWhere is the God of justice?\u201d"}

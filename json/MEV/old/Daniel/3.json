{"1": "Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its width six cubits.[a] He set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. ", "2": "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the officials, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

They have defied the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. ", "29": "Therefore I make a decree that every people, nation, and language which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other God who can deliver in this way.\u201d", "30": "Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."}

", "3": "The king said to them, \u201cI have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.\u201d", "4": "Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic,[a] \u201cO king, live forever. Tell your servants the dream, and we will tell the interpretation.\u201d", "5": "The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, \u201cThe command from me is firm: If you will not make known to me the dream with its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill.

This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you. And its form was awesome.

And the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.", "36": "\u201cThis was the dream. Now we will tell its interpretation before the king. ", "37": "You, O king, are the king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

You are the head of gold.", "39": "\u201cAfter you, another kingdom inferior to you shall arise, and a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. ", "40": "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, for iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, it shall crush and shatter all these. ", "41": "As you saw the feet and toes, partly of potters' clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it some of the strength of the iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay. ", "42": "As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken. ", "43": "Whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cleave to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.", "44": "\u201cIn the days of these kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

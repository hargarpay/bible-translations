", "2": "And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and he cast images for Baal worship. ", "3": "And he made sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, and he burned his sons in the fire according to the detestable acts of the nations that the Lord had displaced before the sons of Israel. ", "4": "He even made sacrifices and offered incense on the high places of the hills and under every green tree.", "5": "So the Lord his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram. They struck Ahaz and took captive many prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was even given into the hand of the king of Israel, and he attacked Ahaz with a great slaughter. ", "6": "And Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, and they were all strong men, but they abandoned the Lord God of their fathers.

Our guilt is great, and there is already a burning anger against Israel.\u201d", "14": "So the soldiers left the captives and spoil before the officials and all the assembly. ", "15": "Then the men who were designated by name took the captives and clothed those who were naked from the plunder. So they clothed them, gave them sandals, offered them food and drink, anointed them with oil, and led them on donkeys, even all those who stumbled.

Then he shut the doors of the house of the Lord, and he made altars in every corner of Jerusalem. ", "25": "Then in every city in Judah he made high places to make offerings to other gods.

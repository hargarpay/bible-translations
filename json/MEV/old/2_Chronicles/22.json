So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram reigned in Jerusalem.", "2": "Now Ahaziah was forty-two years[a] old when he began to reign, but he only reigned one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.", "3": "And he also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab because his mother was the one counseling him to do evil. ", "4": "And he also did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, like the house of Ahab, for they served as his counselors after his father Jehoram died, which led to his destruction. ", "5": "Even Ahaziah walked in their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. And the Arameans wounded Joram, ", "6": "and the king returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds that he sustained in Ramah where he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was wounded.", "7": "And it was from God that a downfall would happen to Ahaziah in regard to his visit with Joram.

", "11": "But Jehoshabeath,[b] the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from the king's sons who were going to be put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in a bed chamber.

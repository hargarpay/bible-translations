", "16": "They stood at their places according to the Law of Moses, the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood they received from the hands of the Levites. ", "17": "For there were many in the assembly who had consecrated themselves, so the Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for those who were not clean in order to consecrate the people to the Lord. ", "18": "For a multitude of the people\u2014many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun\u2014had not purified themselves. For they ate of the Passover contrary to what was written.

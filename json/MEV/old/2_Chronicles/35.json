He did not listen to the words of Necho that came from the mouth of God, but he came to battle in the plain of Megiddo.", "23": "So the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, \u201cTake me away for I am severely wounded.\u201d ", "24": "Then his servants took him from the chariot, and they set him in a second chariot, and they brought him to Jerusalem. He died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.", "25": "And Jeremiah composed a dirge for Josiah, and all the male and female singers speak of Josiah in their laments to this day. They set them as a statute over Israel.

{"1": "Israel is a fertile vine that brings forth its fruit. As his fruit multiplied, so his altars increased; as his land prospered, so he[a] improved his pillars.", "2": "Their heart is divided; now they must bear their guilt. He will break down their altars and destroy their pillars.", "3": "For now they will say, \u201cWe have no king, because we do not fear the Lord; and a king, what could he do for us?\u201d", "4": "They speak mere words, swearing falsely in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like a poisonous plant in the furrows of the field.", "5": "The inhabitants of Samaria fear because of the calf of Beth Aven. For its people mourn for it, and its priests shriek for it, because its glory has departed from it.", "6": "It will be carried to Assyria as a tribute to King Jareb.[b] Ephraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.[c]", "7": "As for Samaria, her king will perish like a twig on the water.", "8": "The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars. They will say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.", "9": "O Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah. There they have continued.[d] Will not the war in Gibeah against evildoers overtake them?", "10": "When I desire, I will punish them. The nations will be gathered against them when they are disciplined[e] for their two transgressions.", "11": "Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh grain, but I harnessed her fair neck; I will make Ephraim pull a plow. Judah will plow; Jacob shall furrow for himself.", "12": "Sow to yourselves righteousness, reap mercy, break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek the Lord, until He comes and rains righteousness upon you.", "13": "You have plowed wickedness. You have reaped iniquity, and you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your power and in the numbers of your warriors,", "14": "therefore a tumult will arise among your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle; mothers were dashed to pieces upon their children.", "15": "So will it be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be utterly cut off."}

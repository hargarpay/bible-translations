She that conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, \u201cI will pursue my lovers, who provide my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.\u201d", "6": "Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and make a wall, so that she will not find her paths.", "7": "She will pursue her lovers, but she will not reach them; and she will seek them but will not find them. Then she will say, \u201cI will go and return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than now.\u201d", "8": "But she did not know that it was I who provided her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and multiplied her silver and gold that they used for Baal.", "9": "Therefore I will take back My grain in its time and My wine in its season, and I will recover My wool and My flax, given to cover her nakedness.", "10": "Therefore I will uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her from My hand.", "11": "I will also bring to an end all her joy, her annual feasts, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.", "12": "I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, \u201cThese are my rewards that my lovers have given me.\u201d I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field will eat them.", "13": "I will punish her for the days of the Baals, when she burned incense to them and adorned herself with her earrings and her jewelry, and pursued her lovers, but forgot Me, declares the Lord.", "14": "Therefore, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.", "15": "From there, I will give her vineyards to her, and the Valley of Achor as a door of hope.

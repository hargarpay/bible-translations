{"1": "Now one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha, \u201cYour servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the Lord, but a creditor has come to take my two sons as slaves.\u201d", "2": "Elisha said to her, \u201cWhat shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?\u201d She said, \u201cYour servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.\u201d", "3": "Then he said, \u201cGo, ask for vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels and not just a few. ", "4": "Then go in, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour the oil into all these vessels. When each is full, set it aside.\u201d", "5": "So she left him and shut the door behind her and her sons, and they kept bringing vessels to her, and she kept pouring. ", "6": "When the vessels were full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another vessel.\u201d But he said to her, \u201cThere is not another vessel.\u201d And the oil ceased.", "7": "Then she went and told the man of God. And he said, \u201cGo, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and you and your children can live on the rest.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha passed through Shunem, and a noble woman was there who urged him to eat a meal. So whenever he passed through, he stopped there to eat a meal. ", "9": "And she said to her husband, \u201cI know that he is a holy man of God regularly passing through near us. ", "10": "Let us make a little walled upper room and put for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so when he comes to us he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "One day he came by there, and he turned aside to the upper room and lay down.

", "13": "He said to him, \u201cSay to her, Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What may be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king, or to the captain of the army?\u201d And she answered, \u201cI am living among my people.\u201d", "14": "He said, \u201cWhat may be done for her?\u201d And Gehazi said, \u201cActually, she has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "He said, \u201cCall her.\u201d When he had called her, she stood in the entrance. ", "16": "He said, \u201cAt this season, when it is time, you will embrace a son.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, my lord, man of God, do not lie to your servant.\u201d", "17": "But the woman conceived and bore a son at that season, at the time that Elisha had told her.", "18": "When the child was older, he went out one day to his father with the reapers.

", "21": "She went up, and laid him down on the bed of the man of God, shut the door on him, and went out.", "22": "Then she called to her husband, \u201cSend me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may run to the man of God and return.\u201d", "23": "He said, \u201cWhy are you going to him today? It is neither New Moon nor Sabbath.\u201d She said, \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d", "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \u201cLead on, and do not hold back for me unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "So she went and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her far off, he said to Gehazi his servant, \u201cLook, over there is the Shunammite woman. ", "26": "Now run to meet her, and say to her, Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?\u201d And she said, \u201cIt is all right.\u201d", "27": "When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she grabbed his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away. But the man of God said, \u201cLet her alone, for she is in bitter distress, and the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me.\u201d", "28": "Then she said, \u201cDid I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, Do not give me false hope?\u201d", "29": "Then he said to Gehazi, \u201cPrepare yourself, take my staff in your hand, and go. If you find anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him, and lay my staff on the face of the boy.\u201d", "30": "Then the boy's mother said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as you live, I will not leave without you.\u201d And he got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi passed through ahead of them and laid the staff on the face of the boy, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and told him, \u201cThe boy is not awake.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha came into the house, he saw that the boy was dead, lying on his bed. ", "33": "So he went in, and shut the door on the two of them, and prayed to the Lord. ", "34": "He went up and lay on the child, put his face on his face, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. Then he bent over the child, and the child's flesh warmed. ", "35": "Then he got down, walked once back and forth in the house, and went up, and bent over him; the boy sneezed seven times, and the boy opened his eyes.", "36": "Then Elisha called Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite woman.\u201d So he called her, and she came to him. Then he said, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d ", "37": "Then she came in, fell at his feet, and bowed down to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.", "38": "When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his servant, \u201cPut on the big cooking pot, and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.\u201d", "39": "One went out into the field to gather herbs. He found a wild vine and gathered from it wild gourds, filling his clothes, and came and split them into the pot of stew, but they did not recognize them.

But as they were eating the stew, they cried out, \u201cMan of God, there is death in the pot.\u201d They could not eat it.", "41": "But he said, \u201cThen bring flour.\u201d He threw it into the pot and said, \u201cPour it for the people and let them eat.\u201d And there was nothing bad in the pot.", "42": "A man came from Baal Shalishah, and he brought the man of God food from the first fruits\u2014twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain\u2014in his sack. And Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people and let them eat.\u201d", "43": "But his servant said, \u201cHow can I set this before a hundred men?\u201d He said, \u201cGive it to the people and let them eat, for thus says the Lord, 'They will eat and have some left.'\u202f\u201d ", "44": "So he set it before them, they ate, and some was left over, according to the word of the Lord."}

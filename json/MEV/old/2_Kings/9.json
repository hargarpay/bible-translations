", "2": "When you get there, look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in and make him rise from among his brothers, and bring him into an inner chamber. ", "3": "Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, 'Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you king over Israel.' Then open the door and flee. Do not wait.\u201d", "4": "So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. ", "5": "When he arrived, the commanders of the army were sitting, and he said, \u201cI have a word for you, Commander.\u201d Jehu said, \u201cWhich one of us?\u201d And he said, \u201cFor you, Commander.\u201d", "6": "So he arose, went into the house, poured the oil on his head, and said to him, \u201cThus says the Lord, God of Israel: I am anointing you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.

", "10": "Dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury her.\u201d Then he opened the door and fled.", "11": "When Jehu had returned to his master's servants, one said to him, \u201cIs all well? Why did this madman come to you?\u201d And he said to them, \u201cYou know this man and his babble.\u201d", "12": "They said, \u201cA lie! Tell us.\u201d Then he said, \u201cThus and thus he spoke to me, saying, 'Thus says the Lord: I am anointing you king over Israel.'\u202f\u201d", "13": "Then they hurried. Each took his clothes, put them under him on the bare stairs, and blew a horn, saying, \u201cJehu is king.\u201d", "14": "So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.

So Jehu said, \u201cIf this be your minds, let no fugitive exit the city to go tell Jezreel.\u201d ", "16": "Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.", "17": "A watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he was coming and said, \u201cI see a company.\u201d And Joram said, \u201cTake a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'\u202f\u201d", "18": "So the horseman went to meet him and said, \u201cThus says the king, 'Is it peace?'\u202f\u201d But Jehu said, \u201cWhat have you to do with peace? Circle in behind me.\u201d So the watchman reported, \u201cThe messenger came to them, but he is not returning.\u201d", "19": "Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, \u201cThus says the king, 'Is it peace?'\u202f\u201d Again, Jehu said, \u201cWhat have you to do with peace? Circle in behind me.\u201d", "20": "The watchman reported, \u201cHe came to them, but he is not returning. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.\u201d", "21": "Then Joram said, \u201cHitch my chariot.\u201d So his chariot was hitched, and Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot. They went out to meet Jehu and found him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.

Remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab his father and the Lord pronounced this oracle about him: ", "26": "'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and his sons, declares the Lord, and I will pay you back on this property, declares the Lord.' Now lift him up and throw him onto the property, according to the word of the Lord.\u201d", "27": "But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled on the path to the garden house. Jehu chased after him and said, \u201cShoot him too.\u201d So they shot him on the ascent to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there.

Who?\u201d And two or three eunuchs looked down to him. ", "33": "He said, \u201cDrop her down.\u201d So they dropped her down and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses. Then he trampled her.", "34": "Then he entered, ate and drank, and said, \u201cAttend to that cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.\u201d ", "35": "So they went to bury her, but they found nothing of her except a skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands. ", "36": "They returned and told Jehu, and he said, \u201cThis is the word of the Lord, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'On the property of Jezreel dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel.

If they spare our lives, we will live, and if they kill us, we will die.\u201d", "5": "So they rose at twilight to enter the camp of the Arameans. When they came to the edge of the camp of the Arameans, there was no one there.

There was no sound of a man's voice, only horses tied, donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.\u201d ", "11": "Then the gatekeepers called out and told the king's household inside.", "12": "The king got up in the night and said to his servants, \u201cI will show you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are starving, so they left the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and get into the city.'\u202f\u201d", "13": "One of his servants answered, \u201cLet some men take five of the remaining horses, since those remaining will suffer the fate of the whole multitude of Israel that have perished already; so let us send them and see.\u201d", "14": "So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the army of the Arameans, saying, \u201cGo and see.\u201d ", "15": "So they went after them to the Jordan, and the whole way was full of clothes and vessels, which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste.

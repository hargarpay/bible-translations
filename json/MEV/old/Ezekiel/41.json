There were offsets all around to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.

Therefore the width of the temple increased going upwards and thus one went up from the lowest to the highest level through the middle level.", "8": "I saw also the height all around the temple. The foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. ", "9": "The thickness of the wall of the side chambers was five cubits.

", "18": "It was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between cherub and cherub. And every cherub had two faces, ", "19": "so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side.

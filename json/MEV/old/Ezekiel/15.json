{"1": "And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ", "2": "Son of man, how is the wood of the vine tree better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest? ", "3": "Can wood be taken from it to do any work, or can men take a peg of it to hang any vessel on it? ", "4": "If it has been cast into the fire for fuel and the fire has devoured both ends of it and the middle of it is burned, is it useful for any work? ", "5": "When it was whole, it was not made into anything. How much less is it useful for any work when the fire has devoured it and it is burned!", "6": "Therefore thus says the Lord God: As the wood of the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. ", "7": "I will set My face against them. Though they go out from one fire, yet the fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I am the Lord when I set My face against them. ", "8": "I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord God."}

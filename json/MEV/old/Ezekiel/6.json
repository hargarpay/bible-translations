{"1": "And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ", "2": "Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, ", "3": "and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys: Pay attention. I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. ", "4": "Your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken. And I will cast down your slain men before your idols. ", "5": "I will lay the dead corpses of the sons of Israel before their idols. And I will scatter your bones all around your altars. ", "6": "In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. ", "7": "The slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord.", "8": "Yet I will leave a remnant, for you will have some who escape the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries. ", "9": "Those of you who escape shall remember Me among the nations wherever they shall be carried captive, because I am broken by their whorish heart which has departed from Me, and with their eyes which play the harlot after their idols. And they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. ", "10": "They shall know that I am the Lord, and that I have not said in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.", "11": "Thus says the Lord God: Clap your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by sword, by famine, and by pestilence. ", "12": "He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by famine. Thus I will accomplish My fury upon them. ", "13": "Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain men shall be among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they offered sweet savor to all their idols. ", "14": "So, in all their habitations I will stretch out My hand upon them and make the land desolate, indeed, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah. And they shall know that I am the Lord."}

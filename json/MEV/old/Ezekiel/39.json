{"1": "Moreover you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: Thus says the Lord God: I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshek, and Tubal. ", "2": "And I will turn you back, drive you on, and take you up the north parts and bring you against the mountains of Israel. ", "3": "And I will strike your bow out of your left hand and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand. ", "4": "You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the peoples who are with you. I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. ", "5": "You shall fall upon the open field. For I have spoken, says the Lord God. ", "6": "I will send a fire on Magog and among those who dwell safely in the coastlands. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.", "7": "So I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel. And I will not let them pollute My holy name anymore. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel. ", "8": "It is coming and it shall be done, says the Lord God. This is the day of which I have spoken.", "9": "Those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go and make fires with the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the war clubs and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire for seven years. ", "10": "They shall take no wood out of the field, or cut down any out of the forests, for they shall make fires with the weapons. And they shall despoil those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, says the Lord God.", "11": "It shall come to pass in that day that I will give to Gog a place of graves there in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea, and it shall stop the passengers. And there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude, and they shall call it the Valley of Hamon Gog.", "12": "For seven months the house of Israel shall be burying them so that they may cleanse the land. ", "13": "Indeed, all the people of the land shall bury them. And it shall be their renown on the day that I shall be glorified, says the Lord God. ", "14": "They shall separate men who continually pass through the land to bury the passengers, even those who remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it. After the end of seven months they shall search. ", "15": "As the passengers pass through the land and anyone sees a man's bone, then he shall set up a sign by it until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog. ", "16": "Also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus they shall cleanse the land.", "17": "As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord God: Speak to every kind of fowl and to every beast of the field: Assemble and come. Gather on every side to My sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood. ", "18": "You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the officials of the earth as though of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. ", "19": "You shall eat fat until you are full and drink blood until you are drunk from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. ", "20": "Thus you shall be filled at My table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all the men of war, says the Lord God.", "21": "I will set My glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see My judgment that I have executed, and My hand that I have laid upon them. ", "22": "So the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward. ", "23": "The nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against Me, and I hid My face from them. And I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and all of them fell by the sword. ", "24": "According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions, I have done to them and hid My face from them.", "25": "Therefore thus says the Lord God: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel and will be jealous for My holy name. ", "26": "They shall forget their shame and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against Me when they lived safely in their land and no one made them afraid. ", "27": "When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. ", "28": "Then they shall know that I am the Lord their God who caused them to be led into captivity among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land and have left none of them there anymore. ", "29": "Nor will I hide My face from them anymore. For I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord God."}

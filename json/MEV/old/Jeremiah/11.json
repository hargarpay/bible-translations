So you shall be My people, and I will be your God, ", "5": "that I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered and said, \u201cSo be it, O Lord.\u201d", "6": "Then the Lord said to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.

", "13": "For according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah. And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.", "14": "Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them.

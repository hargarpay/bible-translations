{"1": "The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh conquered Gaza.", "2": "Thus says the Lord: See, waters rise up out of the north and will be an overflowing flood, and will overflow the land, and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell in it. Then the men shall cry out and all the inhabitants of the land will howl", "3": "at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels. The fathers will not look back to their children because of the feebleness of their hands,", "4": "because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remains. For the Lord will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.", "5": "Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon has been cut off. O remnant of their valley, how long shall you gash yourself?", "6": "O sword of the Lord, how long shall you not be quiet? Withdraw into your sheath, rest, and be still.", "7": "How can it be quiet, seeing the Lord has given it a charge against Ashkelon and against the sea shore? There He has appointed it."}

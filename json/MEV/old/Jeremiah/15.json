", "4": "I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.", "5": "For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who shall bemoan you? Or who shall go aside to ask how you are doing?", "6": "You who have forsaken Me, says the Lord, you keep going backward.

I will destroy My people, since they did not repent from their ways.", "8": "Their widows will increase before Me more than the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mother of a young man, a destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly bring down on her sorrow and terrors.", "9": "She who has borne seven sons languishes; she has given up the spirit; her sun has gone down while it was yet day; she has been ashamed and humiliated. And the rest of them I will deliver to the sword before their enemies, says the Lord.", "10": "Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me as a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!

Because of your longsuffering, do not take me away. Know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke.", "16": "Your words were found and I ate them. And Your word became to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart, for I am called by Your name, O Lord God of Hosts.", "17": "I did not sit in the assembly of mockers, nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand, for You have filled me with indignation.", "18": "Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Shall You be altogether to me as a deceptive stream and as waters that fail?", "19": "Therefore thus says the Lord: If you return, then I will bring you back, and you shall stand before Me; and if you take out the precious from the worthless, you will be My spokesman.

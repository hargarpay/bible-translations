I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.", "20": "Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed, for the whole land is devastated. Suddenly are my tents devastated, and my curtains in a moment.", "21": "How long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?", "22": "\u201cFor My people are foolish, they have not known Me.

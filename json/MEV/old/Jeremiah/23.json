", "2": "Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel against the shepherds that feed My people: You have scattered My flock and driven them away and have not visited them. I am about to punish you for the evil of your deeds, says the Lord. ", "3": "I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries wherever I have driven them and bring them again to their folds, and they shall be fruitful and increase. ", "4": "I will also set up shepherds over them who will feed them; and they will fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor will they be missing, says the Lord.", "5": "The days are coming, says the Lord, that I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the earth.", "6": "In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell safely. And this is the name by which he will be called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.", "7": "Therefore, surely the days are coming, says the Lord, when they will no more say, \u201cAs the Lord lives who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,\u201d ", "8": "but, \u201cAs the Lord lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel out of the north country and from all countries where I had driven them.\u201d Then they will dwell in their own land.", "9": "My heart is broken within me, because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord, and because of His holy words.", "10": "For the land is full of adulterers; for the land mourns because of the curse.

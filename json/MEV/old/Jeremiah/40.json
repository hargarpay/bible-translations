{"1": "The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all who were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried away captive to Babylon. ", "2": "The captain of the guard had taken Jeremiah, and said to him: \u201cThe Lord your God has pronounced this disaster upon this place. ", "3": "And the Lord has brought it and done according as He has said. Because you have sinned against the Lord, and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you. ", "4": "Now look, I am loosening you this day from the chains which are on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come and I will look well after you. But if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, never mind. See, all the land is before you. Go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.\u201d ", "5": "Now while he was not yet going back, he said, \u201cGo back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever it seems right for you to go.\u201d So the captain of the guard gave him rations and a gift and let him go. ", "6": "Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.", "7": "Now all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed men to him, and women, and children, and some of the poorest of the land who were not carried away captive to Babylon. ", "8": "Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maakathite, they and their men. ", "9": "Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, \u201cDo not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. ", "10": "As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans who will come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that you have taken.\u201d", "11": "Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan. ", "12": "Then all the Jews returned out of all places wherever they were driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.", "13": "Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, ", "14": "and said to him, \u201cDo you certainly know that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you?\u201d But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.", "15": "Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, \u201cLet me go, please, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it. Why should he slay you so that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered and the remnant in Judah perish?\u201d", "16": "But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, \u201cYou shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.\u201d"}

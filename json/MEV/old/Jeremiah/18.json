", "4": "Yet the vessel that he made of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.", "5": "Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ", "6": "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter? says the Lord. As the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. ", "7": "At one moment I may speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it. ", "8": "If that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I thought to do to it. ", "9": "Or at another moment I may speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it. ", "10": "If it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will relent of the good with which I said I would bless it.", "11": "Now therefore speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus says the Lord: Look, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Repent now, everyone from his evil way, and make your ways and your deeds good. ", "12": "But they say, \u201cThere is no hope! But we will walk after our own devices, and each of us will do according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.\u201d", "13": "Therefore thus says the Lord: Ask now among the nations, who has heard such things?

For they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before You to speak good for them, and to turn away Your wrath from them.", "21": "Therefore, deliver up their children to the famine and pour out their blood by the power of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children and become widows and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.", "22": "Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have dug a pit to take me and hidden snares for my feet.", "23": "Yet, Lord, You know all their counsel against me to slay me.

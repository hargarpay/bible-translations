", "2": "Now is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you have been working? Tonight he winnows barley on the threshing floor. ", "3": "Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but do not let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. ", "4": "When he lies down, notice the place where he is lying. Go in and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what you will do.\u201d", "5": "She said to her, \u201cAll that you say to me I will do.\u201d ", "6": "So she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had instructed.", "7": "When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.

You have shown your last act of kindness to be greater than the first, because you have not pursued young men, whether poor or rich. ", "11": "So now, my daughter, do not worry.

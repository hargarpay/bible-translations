I will enter into judgment with them there regarding My people and My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations; they have also divided up My land.", "3": "They have cast lots for My people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute; they have sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.", "4": "Also, what are you to Me, Tyre and Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying Me for something? If you are repaying Me, I will return your payment swiftly and speedily on your head. ", "5": "For you have taken My silver and My gold, and you have carried off My finest treasures to your temples. ", "6": "You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their border.", "7": "I am about to rouse them from the place to which you have sold them, and I will return your payment on your head. ", "8": "I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans\u2014to a distant nation, for the Lord has spoken.", "9": "Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate a war!

Bring down Your warriors, O Lord.", "12": "Let the nations be roused, and go up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.", "13": "Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.

The Lord dwells in Zion!"}

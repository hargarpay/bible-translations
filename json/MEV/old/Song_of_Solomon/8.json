If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.", "2": "I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother, she who used to instruct me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranates.", "3": "His left hand is under my head, and his right arm embraces me!", "4": "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.", "5": "Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you.

Its fires of desire are as ardent flames, a most intense flame.", "7": "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, it would be utterly condemned.", "8": "We have a little sister, and she has no breasts.

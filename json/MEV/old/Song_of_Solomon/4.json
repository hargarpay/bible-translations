{"1": "How fair you are, my love! How very fair! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats, streaming down the hills of Gilead.", "2": "Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them has lost its young.", "3": "Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.", "4": "Your neck is like the tower of David, built in rows of stone; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of mighty men.", "5": "Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.", "6": "Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will go away to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.", "7": "You are altogether fair, my love; there is no flaw in you.", "8": "Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.", "9": "You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; you have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.", "10": "How fair is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better than wine is your love, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!", "11": "Your lips drip honey, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the fragrance of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.", "12": "A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a fountain sealed.", "13": "Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,", "14": "nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices\u2014", "15": "a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.", "16": "Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits."}

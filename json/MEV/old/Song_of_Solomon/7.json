{"1": "How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.", "2": "Your navel is a round bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.", "3": "Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.", "4": "Your neck is like an ivory tower, your eyes pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, overlooking Damascus.", "5": "Your head crowns like Carmel, and your flowing hair is like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.", "6": "How fair and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights!", "7": "Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.", "8": "I say I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its branches. Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,", "9": "and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.", "10": "I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.", "11": "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and lodge in the villages;", "12": "let us go out early to the vineyards, and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.", "13": "The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, my beloved."}

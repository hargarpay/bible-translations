{"1": "I come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gather my myrrh with my spice; I eat my honeycomb with my honey; I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, and be drunk with love!", "2": "I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. \u201cOpen to me, my sister, and my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.\u201d", "3": "I had taken off my garment; how could I put it on again? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?", "4": "My beloved put his hand by the latch, and my heart yearned for him.", "5": "I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh on the handles of the bolt.", "6": "I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer.", "7": "The watchmen found me as they went about the city; they struck me, they wounded me; they took away my mantle, those watchmen of the walls.", "8": "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am faint with love.", "9": "What is your beloved more than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you so charge us?", "10": "My beloved is white and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.", "11": "His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.", "12": "His eyes are like doves beside rivers of water, bathed in milk, fitly set.", "13": "His cheeks are like beds of spices, mounds of scented herbs. His lips are lilies, dripping liquid myrrh.", "14": "His arms are rods of gold, set with jewels. His body is bright ivory, inlaid with sapphires.", "15": "His legs are alabaster columns, set on bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.", "16": "His mouth is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."}

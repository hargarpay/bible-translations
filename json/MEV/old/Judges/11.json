His wife's sons grew up and drove Jephthah away. They said to him, \u201cYou will not inherit anything from our father's house because you are the son of another woman.\u201d ", "3": "So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Men of ill repute gathered around Jephthah and went out with him.", "4": "Some time passed, then the Ammonites waged war with Israel. ", "5": "When the Ammonites waged war with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob. ", "6": "They said to Jephthah, \u201cCome and be our leader so that we may fight the Ammonites.\u201d", "7": "Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, \u201cDid you not hate me and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now that you are in trouble?\u201d", "8": "The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cEven so, we have turned to you. Come with us and fight the Ammonites. You will be ruler over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\u201d", "9": "Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, \u201cIf you bring me back to wage war against the Ammonites, and the Lord gives them to me, then I will be your ruler.\u201d", "10": "The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cMay the Lord be a witness between us if we do not act according to your word.\u201d ", "11": "So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead.

They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he was unwilling. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.", "18": "\u201cThey went into the wilderness, around the lands of Edom and Moab. They went east of the land of Moab and set up camp on the other side of the River Arnon. They did not cross the boundary of Moab, for the River Arnon was the boundary of Moab.", "19": "\u201cThen Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon. Israel said to him, \u201cPlease let us pass through your land to our home.\u201d ", "20": "Yet Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people and set up camp in Jahaz to fight with Israel.", "21": "\u201cThe Lord God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into the hands of Israel, and they struck them down.

Why did you not take them back during that time? ", "27": "So I have not sinned against you, but it is you who are doing evil to me by waging war against me. May the Lord, the Judge, judge today between the children of Israel and the Ammonites.\u201d", "28": "Yet the Ammonite king would not listen to the message that Jephthah had sent him.", "29": "Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and went on to the Ammonites.

You are my undoing, for I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot take it back.\u201d", "36": "She said to him, \u201cMy father, you have opened your mouth to the Lord. Do to me what has come out of your mouth, because the Lord worked vengeance upon your enemies, the Ammonites.\u201d ", "37": "Then she said to her father, \u201cLet this be done for me: Give me two months, and I and my friends will wander the hill country and mourn over my virginity.\u201d", "38": "He said, \u201cGo,\u201d and he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went and mourned over her virginity in the hill country. ", "39": "At the end of two months she returned to her father, and he did to her according to the vow that he had made.

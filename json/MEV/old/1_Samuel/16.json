{"1": "The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cHow long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from ruling over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for Myself from among his sons.\u201d", "2": "Samuel said, \u201cHow can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cTake a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.' ", "3": "Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you will do. And you will anoint for Me him whom I tell to you.\u201d", "4": "Samuel did that which the Lord spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, \u201cDo you come in peace?\u201d", "5": "And he said, \u201cI have come in peace to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.\u201d And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.", "6": "When they came, he looked on Eliab, and said, \u201cSurely the anointed of the Lord is before Him.\u201d", "7": "But the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDo not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees. For man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.\u201d", "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, \u201cNeither has the Lord chosen this one.\u201d ", "9": "Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, \u201cNeither has the Lord chosen this one.\u201d ", "10": "So Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen these.\u201d ", "11": "Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cAre these all your young men?\u201d And he said, \u201cThere remains yet the youngest, and there he is shepherding the flock.\u201d Then Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cSend and bring him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.\u201d", "12": "So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and a good appearance. And the Lord said, \u201cArise, anoint him, for this is he.\u201d", "13": "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord came on David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.", "14": "Now the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord terrified him.", "15": "So the servants of Saul said to him, \u201cSee, an evil spirit from God troubles you. ", "16": "Let our lord now tell your servants, who are before you, that they might seek out a man experienced in playing the lyre. And it will come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he will play with his hand, and you will be well.\u201d", "17": "Saul said to his servants, \u201cFind me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.\u201d", "18": "Then one from the servants answered, and said, \u201cI have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is experienced in playing music, a mighty man of valor, a man of battle, and skillful in words, even a man of fine appearance. And the Lord is with him.\u201d", "19": "Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, \u201cSend me David your son, who is with the sheep.\u201d ", "20": "Jesse took a donkey laden with bread, a bottle of wine, and a young goat and he sent them with his son David to Saul.", "21": "David came to Saul, and stood before him. And Saul loved him greatly and he became his armor bearer. ", "22": "Saul sent to Jesse, saying, \u201cLet David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.\u201d", "23": "It happened that when the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David would take the lyre in his hand and play. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."}

", "7": "The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam. His iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels.[c] And a shield-bearer was walking before him.", "8": "He stood and called out to the ranks of Israel, \u201cWhy have you come out to line up for battle? Am not I the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man and let him come down to me. ", "9": "If he is able to fight with me and to strike me down, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, then you will be our servants and will serve us.\u201d ", "10": "The Philistine said, \u201cI defy the battle lines of Israel this day.

And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, \u201cWhy have you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart. For you have come down that you might see the battle.\u201d", "29": "David said, \u201cWhat have I done now? Was it not only a word?\u201d ", "30": "And he turned from him toward another and spoke in the same way. And the people answered him again as at the first. ", "31": "When the words which David spoke were heard, they reported them to Saul and he sent for him.", "32": "David said to Saul, \u201cLet no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\u201d", "33": "Saul said to David, \u201cYou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. For you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.\u201d", "34": "David said to Saul, \u201cYour servant was a shepherd for my father's flock, and the lion came and the bear, and took a lamb out of the flock.

And this uncircumcised Philistine will be as one of them, because he has reviled the armies of the living God.\u201d ", "37": "David said, \u201cThe Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.\u201d And Saul said to David, \u201cGo, and the Lord be with you.\u201d", "38": "Saul clothed David with his armor. And he put a helmet of bronze on his head. He also clothed him with a coat of mail. ", "39": "David secured his sword to his armor and tried to walk, but he was not used to it, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, \u201cI cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.\u201d So David took them off. ", "40": "He took his staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook. And he put them in his shepherd's bag, even in a pouch. And his sling was in his hand. Then he drew near to the Philistine.", "41": "The Philistine came walking and drew near to David, and the man bearing the shield went before him.

Then I will give the corpses of the Philistine camp this day to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

For the battle belongs to the Lord, and He will give you into our hands.\u201d", "48": "When the Philistine arose and came near to meet David, David hurried and ran toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. ", "49": "David put his hand in his bag and took from there a stone. And he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead. Therefore the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the ground.", "50": "So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone. And he struck down the Philistine and slew him, but there was no sword in the hand of David.", "51": "Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine. Then he took his sword and drew it from out of its sheath, and he finished him off and he cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.

So the Philistine dead lay slain on the road to Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron. ", "53": "Then the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they plundered their tents.", "54": "David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.", "55": "When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, \u201cWhose son is this youth, Abner?\u201d And Abner said, \u201cAs your soul lives, O king, I do not know.\u201d", "56": "The king said, \u201cInquire whose son the young man is.\u201d", "57": "So when David returned from slaying the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand.", "58": "Saul said to him, \u201cWhose son are you, young man?\u201d And David answered, \u201cI am the son of your servant, Jesse the Bethlehemite.\u201d"}

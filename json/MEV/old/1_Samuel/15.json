Obedience is better than sacrifice, a listening ear than the fat of rams.", "23": "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has also rejected you from being king.\u201d", "24": "Saul said to Samuel, \u201cI have sinned.

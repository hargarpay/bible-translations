{"1": "Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, and the children of Israel were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel. ", "2": "The lords of the Philistines were advancing by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were advancing in the rear with Achish. ", "3": "Then the princes of the Philistines said, \u201cWhat are these Hebrews doing here?\u201d And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, \u201cIs this not David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years? And I have found no fault in him since the day of his desertion to this day.\u201d", "4": "But the princes of the Philistines became angry with him. And the princes of the Philistines said to him, \u201cMake this man return and let him go again to his place which you have appointed him. He will not go down with us in battle, lest he might be an adversary to us in the battle. For with what could he make himself acceptable to his master, if not with the heads of these men? ", "5": "Is this not David, whom they sing for in dances saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'? \u201d", "6": "Then Achish called David and said to him, \u201cAs the Lord lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the camp has been pleasing in my sight.

However the lords of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us in battle.' ", "10": "Therefore rise up early in the morning with your master's servants who have come with you. And when you have risen early in the morning and it is light, then depart.\u201d", "11": "So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning and return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel."}

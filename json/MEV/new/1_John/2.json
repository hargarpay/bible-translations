", "4": "Whoever says, \u201cI know Him,\u201d and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. ", "5": "But whoever keeps His word truly has the love of God perfected in him. By this we know we are in Him. ", "6": "Whoever says he remains in Him ought to walk as He walked.", "7": "Brothers, I am writing no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning. ", "8": "Yet a new commandment I am writing to you, which holds true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.", "9": "Whoever says he is in the light but hates his brother is in darkness even until now.

I am writing to you, little children, because you have known the Father.", "14": "I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.", "15": "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. ", "16": "For all that is in the world\u2014the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\u2014is not of the Father, but is of the world. ", "17": "The world and its desires are passing away, but the one who does the will of God lives forever.", "18": "Little children, it is the last hour. As you have heard that the antichrist will come, even now there are many antichrists. By this we know that it is the last hour.

", "27": "But the anointing which you have received from Him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. For as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and just as it has taught you, remain in Him.", "28": "And now, little children, remain in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him when He comes.", "29": "If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who does righteousness is born of Him."}

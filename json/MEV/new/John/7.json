", "3": "His brothers therefore said to Him, \u201cDepart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You do. ", "4": "For no one does anything in secret, while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, reveal Yourself to the world.\u201d ", "5": "For even His brothers did not believe in Him.", "6": "Therefore Jesus told them, \u201cMy time has not yet come, but your time is always fitting. ", "7": "The world cannot hate you. But it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil. ", "8": "You go up to this feast. I am not going up to this feast yet, because My time has not yet fully come.\u201d ", "9": "Having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.", "10": "However, after His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up, not publicly, but secretly.

For some said, \u201cHe is a good Man.\u201d Others said, \u201cNo, He deceives the people.\u201d ", "13": "Yet no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.", "14": "Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. ", "15": "The Jews marveled, saying, \u201cHow has this Man become educated, having never been taught?\u201d", "16": "Jesus answered them, \u201cMy teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me. ", "17": "If any man desires to do His will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own authority. ", "18": "He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory. But He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him. ", "19": "Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill Me?\u201d", "20": "The people answered and said, \u201cYou have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?\u201d", "21": "Jesus answered them, \u201cI did one work, and you all marvel.

So the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.", "33": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cI shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to Him who sent Me. ", "34": "You will look for Me and you will not find Me. And where I am, you cannot come.\u201d", "35": "The Jews said among themselves, \u201cWhere does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ", "36": "What kind of saying is this which He said, 'You will look for Me and you will not find Me.

{"1": "Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead. ", "2": "They prepared a supper for Him there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. ", "3": "Then Mary took a pint[a] of very costly ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.", "4": "But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray Him, said, ", "5": "\u201cWhy was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii[b] and given to the poor?\u201d ", "6": "He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief. And having the money box, he used to steal what was put in it.", "7": "But Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone. She has kept this for the day of My burial. ", "8": "For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.\u201d", "9": "When many of the Jews learned that He was there, they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. ", "10": "So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also, ", "11": "because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.", "12": "On the next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. ", "13": "They took branches of palm trees, and went out to meet Him, and cried out: \u201cHosanna! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!'[c] The King of Israel!\u201d", "14": "Then Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written:", "15": "\u201cFear not, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt.\u201d[d]", "16": "His disciples did not understand these things at first. But when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.", "17": "Now the crowd that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. ", "18": "The crowd went and met Him for this reason: They heard that He had performed this sign. ", "19": "So the Pharisees said among themselves, \u201cSee, you are gaining nothing! Look, the world has followed Him!\u201d", "20": "Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. ", "21": "They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, \u201cSir, we want to see Jesus.\u201d ", "22": "Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.", "23": "Jesus answered them, \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ", "24": "Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. ", "25": "He who loves his life will lose it. And he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ", "26": "If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me. Where I am, there will My servant be also. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.", "27": "\u201cNow My soul is troubled. What shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? Instead, for this reason I came to this hour.

Others said, \u201cAn angel has spoken to Him.\u201d", "30": "Jesus answered, \u201cThis voice came not for My sake, but for your sakes. ", "31": "Now judgment is upon this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out. ", "32": "And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to Myself.\u201d ", "33": "He said this to signify by what kind of death He would die.", "34": "The crowd answered Him, \u201cWe have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever. Why do You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?\u201d", "35": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cYet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. He who walks in darkness does not know where he is going. ", "36": "While you have light, believe in the light that you may become sons of light.\u201d  Jesus said these things, and departed and hid Himself from them.", "37": "Though He had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in Him. ", "38": "This fulfilled the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet: \u201cLord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\u201d[e]", "39": "Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah said again:", "40": "\u201cHe has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.\u201d[f]", "41": "Isaiah said this when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.", "42": "Yet many of the rulers also believed in Him.

", "46": "I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not remain in darkness.", "47": "\u201cIf anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. ", "48": "He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him. The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day. ", "49": "For I have not spoken on My own authority, but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak. ", "50": "I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore what I say, I say as the Father tells me.\u201d"}

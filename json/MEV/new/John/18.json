There was a garden which He and His disciples entered.", "2": "Now Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with His disciples. ", "3": "So Judas, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.", "4": "Jesus therefore, knowing everything that would happen to Him, went forward and said to them, \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d", "5": "They answered Him, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cI am He.\u201d And Judas, who betrayed Him, was standing with them. ", "6": "When He said, \u201cI am He,\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground.", "7": "Again Jesus asked them, \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d They said, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d", "8": "Jesus answered, \u201cI told you that I am He. So then let these go their way if you are looking for Me.\u201d ", "9": "This was to fulfill the word which He had spoken, \u201cI have lost none of those whom You have given Me.\u201d", "10": "Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.", "11": "Then Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?\u201d", "12": "Then the detachment of soldiers and the commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him. ", "13": "First they led Him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. ", "14": "Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.", "15": "Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple was known to the high priest and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. ", "16": "But Peter stood at the door outside.

Peter also stood with them and warmed himself.", "19": "The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.", "20": "Jesus answered him, \u201cI spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and I said nothing in secret. ", "21": "Why do you ask Me? Ask those who heard Me and what I have said to them. Certainly they know what I said.\u201d", "22": "When He had said this, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, \u201cIs that how You answer the high priest?\u201d", "23": "Jesus answered him, \u201cIf I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why do you strike me?\u201d ", "24": "Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, \u201cAre you not also one of His disciples?\u201d He denied it and said, \u201cI am not!\u201d", "26": "One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said, \u201cDid I not see you in the garden with Him?\u201d ", "27": "Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.", "28": "Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. Yet they themselves did not enter the Praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.

Your own nation and the chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?\u201d", "36": "Jesus answered, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would fight, that I would not be handed over to the Jews.

For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.\u201d", "38": "Pilate said to Him, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, \u201cI find no guilt in Him at all.", "39": "\u201cBut you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\u201d", "40": "They all shouted again, \u201cNot this Man, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a robber."}

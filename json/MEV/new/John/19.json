", "3": "They said, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d And they hit Him with their hands.", "4": "Again Pilate went out and said to them, \u201cLook, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no guilt in Him.\u201d ", "5": "Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, \u201cHere is the Man!\u201d", "6": "When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, \u201cCrucify Him! Crucify Him!\u201d Pilate said to them, \u201cTake Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him.\u201d", "7": "The Jews answered him, \u201cWe have a law, and by our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God!\u201d", "8": "When Pilate heard these words, he was more afraid, ", "9": "and entered the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, \u201cWhere are You from?\u201d But Jesus gave him no answer. ", "10": "Pilate said to Him, \u201cAre You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to release You, and power to crucify You?\u201d", "11": "Jesus answered, \u201cYou would have no power at all over Me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.\u201d", "12": "From then on, Pilate tried to release Him. But the Jews cried out, \u201cIf you release this Man, you are not Caesar's friend.

So they took Jesus and led Him away. ", "17": "He went out, carrying His own cross, to a place called The Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. ", "18": "There they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.", "19": "Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. The writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.", "20": "Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.

So they put a sponge full of sour wine on hyssop and held it to His mouth. ", "30": "When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.", "31": "Since it was the Day of Preparation, to prevent bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath day (for that Sabbath day was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. ", "32": "Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. ", "33": "But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was dead already, they did not break His legs. ", "34": "However, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. ", "35": "He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true.

Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away His body. ", "39": "Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about seventy-five pounds.[d] ", "40": "Then they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. ", "41": "Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever been buried. ", "42": "So because of the Jewish Day of Preparation, and since the tomb was nearby, they buried Jesus there."}

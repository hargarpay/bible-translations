", "5": "So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. ", "6": "Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being exhausted from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.", "7": "A woman of Samaria came there to draw water. Jesus said to her, \u201cGive Me a drink.\u201d ", "8": "For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.", "9": "Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, \u201cHow is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?\u201d For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.", "10": "Jesus answered her, \u201cIf you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.\u201d", "11": "The woman said to Him, \u201cSir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?

So you have spoken truthfully.\u201d", "19": "The woman said to Him, \u201cSir, I perceive that You are a prophet. ", "20": "Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you all say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\u201d", "21": "Jesus said to her, \u201cWoman, believe Me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. ", "22": "You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. ", "23": "Yet the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. For the Father seeks such to worship Him.

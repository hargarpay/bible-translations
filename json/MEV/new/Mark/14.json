A little while later, those who stood by said again to Peter, \u201cSurely, you are one of them. For you are a Galilean, and your speech confirms it.\u201d", "71": "Peter began to invoke a curse on himself, and to swear, \u201cI do not know this Man of whom you speak.\u201d", "72": "And the rooster crowed a second time.

As he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it. ", "6": "Some fell on a rock. And as soon as it sprang up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. ", "7": "Yet some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. ", "8": "And other seed fell on good ground and sprang up and yielded a hundred times the amount sown.\u201d When He had said these things, He cried out, \u201cHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.\u201d", "9": "His disciples asked Him, \u201cWhat might this parable mean?\u201d ", "10": "He said, \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but to others they are in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'[a]", "11": "\u201cNow the parable means this: The seed is the word of God.

", "15": "But the seed on the good ground are those who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart and bear fruit with patience.", "16": "\u201cNo one, when he lights a candle, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a candlestick, that those who enter may see the light. ", "17": "For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and revealed. ", "18": "Take heed therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given.

", "2": "Jesus answered, \u201cDo you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things? ", "3": "I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. ", "4": "Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse offenders than all men living in Jerusalem? ", "5": "I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.\u201d", "6": "Then He told this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came and looked for fruit on it and found none.

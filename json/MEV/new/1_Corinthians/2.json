", "2": "For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. ", "3": "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. ", "4": "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, ", "5": "so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.", "6": "Yet we speak wisdom among those who are mature, although not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.

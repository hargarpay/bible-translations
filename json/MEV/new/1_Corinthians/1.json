", "5": "By Him you are enriched in everything, in all speech and in all knowledge, ", "6": "even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you, ", "7": "so that you are not lacking in any gift while waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. ", "8": "He will strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. ", "9": "God is faithful, and by Him you were called to the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.", "10": "Now I ask you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak in agreement and that there be no divisions among you.

Besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other. ", "17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.", "18": "For to those who are perishing, the preaching of the cross is foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

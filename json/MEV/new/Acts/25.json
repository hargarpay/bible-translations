And they begged him, ", "3": "asking as a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, plotting to kill him along the way. ", "4": "Festus said that Paul should be kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly. ", "5": "He also said, \u201cLet the men in authority go down with me. If there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.\u201d", "6": "Having stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered that Paul be brought in. ", "7": "When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges against him which they could not prove, ", "8": "while he defended himself, saying, \u201cNeither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned at all.\u201d", "9": "Desiring to do the Jews a favor, Festus answered, \u201cAre you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be judged concerning these charges before me?\u201d", "10": "Paul said, \u201cI am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged.

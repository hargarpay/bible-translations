", "2": "Boarding a ship from Adramyttium, we put out to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.", "3": "The next day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be given care. ", "4": "From there we put out to sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. ", "5": "Sailing across the sea off of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. ", "6": "There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, and he put us on board. ", "7": "We sailed slowly for many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to proceed, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.

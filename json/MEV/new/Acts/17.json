", "6": "But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers to the city officials, crying out, \u201cThese men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, ", "7": "and Jason has received them.

When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. ", "11": "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, daily examining the Scriptures, to find out if these things were so.

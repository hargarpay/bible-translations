{"1": "Then Agrippa said to Paul, \u201cYou are permitted to speak for yourself.\u201d So Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense: ", "2": "\u201cKing Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that today I shall make my defense before you against all the accusations of the Jews, ", "3": "especially because you are an expert in all customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to patiently listen to me.", "4": "\u201cMy manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning in my own nation and at Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. ", "5": "They knew me from the beginning and could testify, if they wished, how according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee. ", "6": "And now I stand on trial for hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, ", "7": "to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God day and night. Concerning this hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews. ", "8": "Why is it judged incredible by you that God raises the dead?", "9": "\u201cI, too, thought that I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, ", "10": "which I indeed did in Jerusalem and locked up many of the saints in prison by authority from the chief priests. And when they were killed, I cast my vote against them. ", "11": "I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme. And being extremely enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.", "12": "\u201cSo I went to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.

It could never by the same sacrifices, which they offer continually year after year, perfect those who draw near. ", "2": "Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshippers, once purified, would no longer be conscious of sins? ", "3": "But in those sacrifices there is an annual reminder of sins.

", "12": "But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. ", "13": "Since that time He has been waiting for His enemies to be made His footstool.

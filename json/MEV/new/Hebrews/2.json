", "2": "For if the word spoken by angels was true, and every sin and disobedience received a just recompense, ", "3": "how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation, which was first declared by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him? ", "4": "God also bore them witness with signs and wonders and diverse miracles and with gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His own will.", "5": "For it was not to the angels that He has subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. ", "6": "But someone in a certain place testified, saying: \u201cWhat is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him?", "7": "You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of Your hands.", "8": "You have put all things in subjection under his feet.\u201d[a] For in subjecting all things under him, He left nothing that is not subjected to him. Yet now we do not see all things subject to him. ", "9": "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels to suffer death, crowned with glory and honor, so that He, by the grace of God, should experience death for everyone.", "10": "For it was fitting for Him, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.

", "16": "For surely He does not help the angels, but He helps the seed of Abraham.

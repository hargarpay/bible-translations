{"1": "Therefore, leaving the elementary principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, ", "2": "of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. ", "3": "This we will do if God permits.", "4": "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, ", "5": "and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, ", "6": "if they fall away, to be renewed once more to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and subject Him to public shame. ", "7": "For land that drinks in the rain that often falls upon it and bears a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from God. ", "8": "But land that bears thorns and thistles is rejected and near to being cursed. Its destiny is to be burned.", "9": "But though we speak in this manner, we are persuaded of better things for you, things that accompany salvation, ", "10": "for God is not unjust so as to forget your work and labor of love that you have shown for His name, in that you have ministered to the saints and continue ministering. ", "11": "We desire that every one of you show the same diligence for the full assurance of hope to the end, ", "12": "so that you may not be lazy, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.", "13": "For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could vow by no one greater, He vowed by Himself, ", "14": "saying, \u201cSurely I will bless you, and surely I will multiply you.\u201d[a] ", "15": "So after Abraham had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.", "16": "For men indeed swear by a greater authority than themselves, and for them an oath of confirmation ends all dispute. ", "17": "So God, wanting to show more abundantly the immutability of His counsel to the heirs of promise, confirmed it by an oath. ", "18": "So that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. ", "19": "We have this hope as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, which enters the Inner Place behind the veil. ", "20": "This is where Jesus has entered for us as a forerunner, since He has become the everlasting High Priest in the order of Melchizedek."}

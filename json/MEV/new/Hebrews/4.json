{"1": "Therefore, since the promise of entering His rest remains, let us fear lest any of you should seem to come short of it. ", "2": "For the gospel was preached to us as well as to them. But the word preached did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith in those who heard it. ", "3": "For we who have believed have entered this rest, as He has said, \u201cAs I have sworn in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.'\u202f\u201d[a] However, His works have been finished since the creation of the world. ", "4": "For He spoke somewhere about the seventh day like this: \u201cAnd God rested on the seventh day from all His works.\u201d[b] ", "5": "And again in the present passage He said, \u201cThey shall not enter My rest.\u201d[c]", "6": "Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and they to whom it was first preached did not enter due to unbelief, ", "7": "again He establishes a certain day, \u201cToday,\u201d saying through David, after so long a time, as it has been said: \u201cToday, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.\u201d[d]", "8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have later spoken of another day.

", "11": "Let us labor therefore to enter that rest, lest anyone fall by the same pattern of unbelief.", "12": "For the word of God is alive, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intents of the heart. ", "13": "There is no creature that is not revealed in His sight, for all things are bare and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.", "14": "Since then we have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to our confession. ", "15": "For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who was in every sense tempted like we are, yet without sin. ", "16": "Let us then come with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."}

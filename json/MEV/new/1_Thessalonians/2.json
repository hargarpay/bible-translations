{"1": "You yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not in vain. ", "2": "But even after we had previously suffered and were shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to declare to you the gospel of God amid much opposition. ", "3": "For our exhortation was not from deceit, nor from uncleanness, nor in guile. ", "4": "But as we were allowed by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not to please men, but God, who examines our hearts. ", "5": "For neither at any time did we come with flattering words, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed. God is our witness. ", "6": "Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you, or from others, even though we might have made demands as the apostles of Christ.", "7": "But we were gentle among you, like a nurse caring for her own children. ", "8": "So having great love toward you, we were willing to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you were dear to us. ", "9": "For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil. Laboring night and day so as not to be an expense to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. ", "10": "You and God are witnesses of how pure, upright, and blameless we ourselves behaved among you who believe. ", "11": "As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and commanded every one of you, as a father does his own children, ", "12": "that you would walk in a manner worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.", "13": "For this reason we thank God without ceasing because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which effectively works also in you who believe. ", "14": "For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God, which in Judea are in Christ Jesus. You also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they have from the Jews, ", "15": "who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us. They do not please God and are contrary to all men, ", "16": "forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved. In this way they are always piling up their sins, but wrath has come upon them to the extreme.", "17": "But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, endeavored all the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. ", "18": "Therefore we wished to come to you\u2014even I, Paul, once and again\u2014but Satan hindered us. ", "19": "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Will it not even be you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? ", "20": "You are our glory and joy."}

{"1": "Brothers, if a man is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, watching yourselves, lest you also be tempted. ", "2": "Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. ", "3": "For if someone thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. ", "4": "But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. ", "5": "For each one shall bear his own burden. ", "6": "Let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.", "7": "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that will he also reap. ", "8": "For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. ", "9": "And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not give up. ", "10": "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who are of the household of faith.", "11": "You see what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.", "12": "It is those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. ", "13": "For they themselves who are circumcised do not keep the law. But they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh. ", "14": "God forbid that I should boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. ", "15": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation. ", "16": "Peace and mercy be on all who walk according to this rule and upon the Israel of God.", "17": "From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.", "18": "Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."}

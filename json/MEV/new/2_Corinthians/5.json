{"1": "We know that if our earthly house, this tent, were to be destroyed, we have an eternal building of God in the heavens, a house not made with hands. ", "2": "In this one we groan, earnestly desiring to be sheltered with our house which is from heaven. ", "3": "Thus being sheltered, we shall not be found unsheltered. ", "4": "For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we wish to be unclothed, but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal might be swallowed up by life. ", "5": "Now He who has created us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the guarantee of the Spirit.", "6": "Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. ", "7": "For we walk by faith, not by sight. ", "8": "Instead, I say that we are confident and willing to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. ", "9": "So whether present or absent, we labor that we may be accepted by Him. ", "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive his recompense in the body, according to what he has done, whether it was good or bad.", "11": "Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men. But we are revealed to God, and I trust we are also revealed in your consciences. ", "12": "For we are not commending ourselves again to you. Instead, we give you occasion to boast on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance and not in heart. ", "13": "If we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. ", "14": "For the love of Christ constrains us, because we thus judge: that if one died for all, then all have died. ", "15": "And He died for all, that those who live should not from now on live for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.", "16": "So from now on we do not regard anyone according to the flesh. Yes, though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet we do not regard Him as such from now on. ", "17": "Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away. Look, all things have become new. ", "18": "All this is from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation, ", "19": "that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their sins against them, and has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation. ", "20": "So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us. We implore you in Christ's stead: Be reconciled to God. ", "21": "God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."}

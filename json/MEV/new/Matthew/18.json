{"1": "At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \u201cWho is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\u201d", "2": "Jesus called a little child to Him and set him in their midst, ", "3": "and said, \u201cTruly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

", "8": "Therefore if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life lame or maimed than having two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal fire. ", "9": "And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than having two eyes to be thrown into the fire of hell.", "10": "\u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones.

If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search for the one which went astray? ", "13": "And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine which never went astray.

I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. ", "33": "Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?'

For since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were since the beginning of the creation.\u201d ", "5": "For they willingly ignore that, by the word of God the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed standing out of the water and in the water, ", "6": "by which the world that then existed was flooded with water and perished. ", "7": "But by the same word, the heavens and the earth that now exist are being reserved for fire, kept for the Day of Judgment and destruction of the ungodly.", "8": "But, beloved, do not be ignorant of this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. ", "9": "The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness. But He is patient with us, because He does not want any to perish, but all to come to repentance.", "10": "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat.

", "16": "As in all his letters, he writes about these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable distort, as they also do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.", "17": "You therefore, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own firm footing, being led away by the deception of the wicked.

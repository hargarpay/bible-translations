{"1": "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. ", "2": "For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. ", "3": "For, being ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to the righteousness of God. ", "4": "Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness for every one who believes.", "5": "For Moses writes about the righteousness which is based on the law: \u201cThe man who does those things shall live by them.\u201d[a] ", "6": "But the righteousness which is based on faith says, \u201cDo not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\u202f\u201d[b] (that is, to bring Christ down), ", "7": "or, 'Who will descend into the deep?'\u2009\u201d \u200a[c] (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). ", "8": "But what does it say? \u201cThe word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.\u201d[d] This is the word of faith that we preach: ", "9": "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved, ", "10": "for with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

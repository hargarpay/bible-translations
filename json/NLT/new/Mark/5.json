How can you ask, 'Who touched me?'\u201d", "32": "But he kept on looking around to see who had done it.", "33": "Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realization of what had happened to her, came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done.", "34": "And he said to her, \u201cDaughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace. Your suffering is over.\u201d", "35": "While he was still speaking to her, messengers arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue.

Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus.", "5": "Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, \u201cMy child, your sins are forgiven.\u201d", "6": "But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves,", "7": "\u201cWhat is he saying? This is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!\u201d", "8": "Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, \u201cWhy do you question this in your hearts?", "9": "Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man 'Your sins are forgiven,' or 'Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk'?", "10": "So I will prove to you that the Son of Man[a] has the authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said,", "11": "\u201cStand up, pick up your mat, and go home!\u201d", "12": "And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers.

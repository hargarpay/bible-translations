But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.", "14": "When Jesus saw what was happening, he was angry with his disciples. He said to them, \u201cLet the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.", "15": "I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\u201d", "16": "Then he took the children in his arms and placed his hands on their heads and blessed them.", "17": "As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, \u201cGood Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d", "18": "\u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cOnly God is truly good.", "19": "But to answer your question, you know the commandments: 'You must not murder.

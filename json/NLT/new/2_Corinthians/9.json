{"1": "I really don't need to write to you about this ministry of giving for the believers in Jerusalem.[a]", "2": "For I know how eager you are to help, and I have been boasting to the churches in Macedonia that you in Greece[b] were ready to send an offering a year ago. In fact, it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving.", "3": "But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected. I don't want to be wrong in my boasting about you.", "4": "We would be embarrassed\u2014not to mention your own embarrassment\u2014if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you weren't ready after all I had told them!", "5": "So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready. But I want it to be a willing gift, not one given grudgingly.", "6": "Remember this\u2014a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop.", "7": "You must each decide in your heart how much to give.

Their good deeds will be remembered forever.\u201d[d]", "10": "For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity[e] in you.", "11": "Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God.", "12": "So two good things will result from this ministry of giving\u2014the needs of the believers in Jerusalem[f] will be met, and they will joyfully express their thanks to God.", "13": "As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ.", "14": "And they will pray for you with deep affection because of the overflowing grace God has given to you.", "15": "Thank God for this gift[g] too wonderful for words!"}

{"1": "Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee.[a] This is how it happened.", "2": "Several of the disciples were there\u2014Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin),[b] Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples.", "3": "Simon Peter said, \u201cI'm going fishing.\u201d \u201cWe'll come, too,\u201d they all said. So they went out in the boat, but they caught nothing all night.", "4": "At dawn Jesus was standing on the beach, but the disciples couldn't see who he was.", "5": "He called out, \u201cFellows,[c] have you caught any fish?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they replied.", "6": "Then he said, \u201cThrow out your net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you'll get some!\u201d So they did, and they couldn't haul in the net because there were so many fish in it.", "7": "Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt's the Lord!\u201d When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his tunic (for he had stripped for work), jumped into the water, and headed to shore.", "8": "The others stayed with the boat and pulled the loaded net to the shore, for they were only about a hundred yards[d] from shore.", "9": "When they got there, they found breakfast waiting for them\u2014fish cooking over a charcoal fire, and some bread.", "10": "\u201cBring some of the fish you've just caught,\u201d Jesus said.", "11": "So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore. There were 153 large fish, and yet the net hadn't torn.", "12": "\u201cNow come and have some breakfast!\u201d Jesus said. None of the disciples dared to ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord.", "13": "Then Jesus served them the bread and the fish.", "14": "This was the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead.", "15": "After breakfast Jesus asked Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me more than these?[e]\u201d \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d Peter replied, \u201cyou know I love you.\u201d \u201cThen feed my lambs,\u201d Jesus told him.", "16": "Jesus repeated the question: \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d Peter said, \u201cyou know I love you.\u201d \u201cThen take care of my sheep,\u201d Jesus said.", "17": "A third time he asked him, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter was hurt that Jesus asked the question a third time. He said, \u201cLord, you know everything. You know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cThen feed my sheep.", "18": "\u201cI tell you the truth, when you were young, you were able to do as you liked; you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others[f] will dress you and take you where you don't want to go.\u201d", "19": "Jesus said this to let him know by what kind of death he would glorify God. Then Jesus told him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d", "20": "Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved\u2014the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked, \u201cLord, who will betray you?\u201d", "21": "Peter asked Jesus, \u201cWhat about him, Lord?\u201d", "22": "Jesus replied, \u201cIf I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? As for you, follow me.\u201d", "23": "So the rumor spread among the community of believers[g] that this disciple wouldn't die. But that isn't what Jesus said at all. He only said, \u201cIf I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\u201d", "24": "This disciple is the one who testifies to these events and has recorded them here. And we know that his account of these things is accurate.", "25": "Jesus also did many other things. If they were all written down, I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written."}

King of the Jews!\u201d they mocked, as they slapped him across the face.", "4": "Pilate went outside again and said to the people, \u201cI am going to bring him out to you now, but understand clearly that I find him not guilty.\u201d", "5": "Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, \u201cLook, here is the man!\u201d", "6": "When they saw him, the leading priests and Temple guards began shouting, \u201cCrucify him! Crucify him!\u201d \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him,\u201d Pilate said. \u201cI find him not guilty.\u201d", "7": "The Jewish leaders replied, \u201cBy our law he ought to die because he called himself the Son of God.\u201d", "8": "When Pilate heard this, he was more frightened than ever.", "9": "He took Jesus back into the headquarters[a] again and asked him, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d But Jesus gave no answer.", "10": "\u201cWhy don't you talk to me?\u201d Pilate demanded. \u201cDon't you realize that I have the power to release you or crucify you?\u201d", "11": "Then Jesus said, \u201cYou would have no power over me at all unless it were given to you from above. So the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\u201d", "12": "Then Pilate tried to release him, but the Jewish leaders shouted, \u201cIf you release this man, you are no 'friend of Caesar.'[b] Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar.\u201d", "13": "When they said this, Pilate brought Jesus out to them again.

Two others were crucified with him, one on either side, with Jesus between them.", "19": "And Pilate posted a sign on the cross that read, \u201cJesus of Nazareth,[d] the King of the Jews.\u201d", "20": "The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, so that many people could read it.", "21": "Then the leading priests objected and said to Pilate, \u201cChange it from 'The King of the Jews' to 'He said, I am King of the Jews.'\u201d", "22": "Pilate replied, \u201cNo, what I have written, I have written.\u201d", "23": "When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among the four of them. They also took his robe, but it was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.", "24": "So they said, \u201cRather than tearing it apart, let's throw dice[e] for it.\u201d This fulfilled the Scripture that says, \u201cThey divided my garments among themselves and threw dice for my clothing.\u201d[f] So that is what they did.", "25": "Standing near the cross were Jesus' mother, and his mother's sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene.", "26": "When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, he said to her, \u201cDear woman, here is your son.\u201d", "27": "And he said to this disciple, \u201cHere is your mother.\u201d And from then on this disciple took her into his home.", "28": "Jesus knew that his mission was now finished, and to fulfill Scripture he said, \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d[g]", "29": "A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips.", "30": "When Jesus had tasted it, he said, \u201cIt is finished!\u201d Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.", "31": "It was the day of preparation, and the Jewish leaders didn't want the bodies hanging there the next day, which was the Sabbath (and a very special Sabbath, because it was Passover week). So they asked Pilate to hasten their deaths by ordering that their legs be broken. Then their bodies could be taken down.", "32": "So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus.", "33": "But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they didn't break his legs.", "34": "One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.", "35": "(This report is from an eyewitness giving an accurate account.

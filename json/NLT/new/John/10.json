{"1": "\u201cI tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!", "2": "But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.", "3": "The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.", "4": "After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.", "5": "They won't follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don't know his voice.\u201d", "6": "Those who heard Jesus use this illustration didn't understand what he meant,", "7": "so he explained it to them: \u201cI tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.", "8": "All who came before me[a] were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.", "9": "Yes, I am the gate. Those who come in through me will be saved.[b] They will come and go freely and will find good pastures.", "10": "The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.", "11": "\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.", "12": "A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don't belong to him and he isn't their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.", "13": "The hired hand runs away because he's working only for the money and doesn't really care about the sheep.", "14": "\u201cI am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,", "15": "just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.", "16": "I have other sheep, too, that are not in this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock with one shepherd.", "17": "\u201cThe Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again.", "18": "No one can take my life from me. I sacrifice it voluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and also to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded.\u201d", "19": "When he said these things, the people[c] were again divided in their opinions about him.", "20": "Some said, \u201cHe's demon possessed and out of his mind. Why listen to a man like that?\u201d", "21": "Others said, \u201cThis doesn't sound like a man possessed by a demon! Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\u201d", "22": "It was now winter, and Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of Hanukkah, the Festival of Dedication.", "23": "He was in the Temple, walking through the section known as Solomon's Colonnade.", "24": "The people surrounded him and asked, \u201cHow long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\u201d", "25": "Jesus replied, \u201cI have already told you, and you don't believe me. The proof is the work I do in my Father's name.", "26": "But you don't believe me because you are not my sheep.", "27": "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.", "28": "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me,", "29": "for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else.[d] No one can snatch them from the Father's hand.", "30": "The Father and I are one.\u201d", "31": "Once again the people picked up stones to kill him.", "32": "Jesus said, \u201cAt my Father's direction I have done many good works. For which one are you going to stone me?\u201d", "33": "They replied, \u201cWe're stoning you not for any good work, but for blasphemy! You, a mere man, claim to be God.\u201d", "34": "Jesus replied, \u201cIt is written in your own Scriptures[e] that God said to certain leaders of the people, 'I say, you are gods!'[f]", "35": "And you know that the Scriptures cannot be altered. So if those people who received God's message were called 'gods,'", "36": "why do you call it blasphemy when I say, 'I am the Son of God'? After all, the Father set me apart and sent me into the world.", "37": "Don't believe me unless I carry out my Father's work.", "38": "But if I do his work, believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done, even if you don't believe me. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.\u201d", "39": "Once again they tried to arrest him, but he got away and left them.", "40": "He went beyond the Jordan River near the place where John was first baptizing and stayed there awhile.", "41": "And many followed him. \u201cJohn didn't perform miraculous signs,\u201d they remarked to one another, \u201cbut everything he said about this man has come true.\u201d", "42": "And many who were there believed in Jesus."}

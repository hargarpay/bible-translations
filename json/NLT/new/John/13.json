{"1": "Before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave this world and return to his Father. He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth, and now he loved them to the very end.[a]", "2": "It was time for supper, and the devil had already prompted Judas,[b] son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.", "3": "Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from God and would return to God.", "4": "So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist,", "5": "and poured water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had around him.", "6": "When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, \u201cLord, are you going to wash my feet?\u201d", "7": "Jesus replied, \u201cYou don't understand now what I am doing, but someday you will.\u201d", "8": "\u201cNo,\u201d Peter protested, \u201cyou will never ever wash my feet!\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cUnless I wash you, you won't belong to me.\u201d", "9": "Simon Peter exclaimed, \u201cThen wash my hands and head as well, Lord, not just my feet!\u201d", "10": "Jesus replied, \u201cA person who has bathed all over does not need to wash, except for the feet,[c] to be entirely clean. And you disciples are clean, but not all of you.\u201d", "11": "For Jesus knew who would betray him. That is what he meant when he said, \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d", "12": "After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, \u201cDo you understand what I was doing?", "13": "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are right, because that's what I am.", "14": "And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.", "15": "I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.", "16": "I tell you the truth, slaves are not greater than their master. Nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message.", "17": "Now that you know these things, God will bless you for doing them.", "18": "\u201cI am not saying these things to all of you; I know the ones I have chosen. But this fulfills the Scripture that says, 'The one who eats my food has turned against me.'[d]", "19": "I tell you this beforehand, so that when it happens you will believe that I am the Messiah.[e]", "20": "I tell you the truth, anyone who welcomes my messenger is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming the Father who sent me.\u201d", "21": "Now Jesus was deeply troubled,[f] and he exclaimed, \u201cI tell you the truth, one of you will betray me!\u201d", "22": "The disciples looked at each other, wondering whom he could mean.", "23": "The disciple Jesus loved was sitting next to Jesus at the table.[g]", "24": "Simon Peter motioned to him to ask, \u201cWho's he talking about?\u201d", "25": "So that disciple leaned over to Jesus and asked, \u201cLord, who is it?\u201d", "26": "Jesus responded, \u201cIt is the one to whom I give the bread I dip in the bowl.\u201d And when he had dipped it, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.", "27": "When Judas had eaten the bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus told him, \u201cHurry and do what you're going to do.\u201d", "28": "None of the others at the table knew what Jesus meant.", "29": "Since Judas was their treasurer, some thought Jesus was telling him to go and pay for the food or to give some money to the poor.", "30": "So Judas left at once, going out into the night.", "31": "As soon as Judas left the room, Jesus said, \u201cThe time has come for the Son of Man[h] to enter into his glory, and God will be glorified because of him.", "32": "And since God receives glory because of the Son,[i] he will give his own glory to the Son, and he will do so at once.", "33": "Dear children, I will be with you only a little longer. And as I told the Jewish leaders, you will search for me, but you can't come where I am going.", "34": "So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other.", "35": "Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.\u201d", "36": "Simon Peter asked, \u201cLord, where are you going?\u201d And Jesus replied, \u201cYou can't go with me now, but you will follow me later.\u201d", "37": "\u201cBut why can't I come now, Lord?\u201d he asked. \u201cI'm ready to die for you.\u201d", "38": "Jesus answered, \u201cDie for me? I tell you the truth, Peter\u2014before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me."}

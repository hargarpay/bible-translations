But just before they arrived at the house, the officer sent some friends to say, \u201cLord, don't trouble yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of such an honor.", "7": "I am not even worthy to come and meet you. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed.", "8": "I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, 'Go,' and they go, or 'Come,' and they come. And if I say to my slaves, 'Do this,' they do it.\u201d", "9": "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, \u201cI tell you, I haven't seen faith like this in all Israel!\u201d", "10": "And when the officer's friends returned to his house, they found the slave completely healed.", "11": "Soon afterward Jesus went with his disciples to the village of Nain, and a large crowd followed him.", "12": "A funeral procession was coming out as he approached the village gate. The young man who had died was a widow's only son, and a large crowd from the village was with her.", "13": "When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. \u201cDon't cry!\u201d he said.", "14": "Then he walked over to the coffin and touched it, and the bearers stopped. \u201cYoung man,\u201d he said, \u201cI tell you, get up.\u201d", "15": "Then the dead boy sat up and began to talk! And Jesus gave him back to his mother.", "16": "Great fear swept the crowd, and they praised God, saying, \u201cA mighty prophet has risen among us,\u201d and \u201cGod has visited his people today.\u201d", "17": "And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding countryside.", "18": "The disciples of John the Baptist told John about everything Jesus was doing. So John called for two of his disciples,", "19": "and he sent them to the Lord to ask him, \u201cAre you the Messiah we've been expecting,[b] or should we keep looking for someone else?\u201d", "20": "John's two disciples found Jesus and said to him, \u201cJohn the Baptist sent us to ask, 'Are you the Messiah we've been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else?'\u201d", "21": "At that very time, Jesus cured many people of their diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits, and he restored sight to many who were blind.", "22": "Then he told John's disciples, \u201cGo back to John and tell him what you have seen and heard\u2014the blind see, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor.\u201d", "23": "And he added, \u201cGod blesses those who do not fall away because of me.[c]\u201d", "24": "After John's disciples left, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. \u201cWhat kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?", "25": "Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are found in palaces.", "26": "Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.", "27": "John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say, 'Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.'[d]", "28": "I tell you, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is!\u201d", "29": "When they heard this, all the people\u2014even the tax collectors\u2014agreed that God's way was right,[e] for they had been baptized by John.", "30": "But the Pharisees and experts in religious law rejected God's plan for them, for they had refused John's baptism.", "31": "\u201cTo what can I compare the people of this generation?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cHow can I describe them?", "32": "They are like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends, 'We played wedding songs, and you didn't dance, so we played funeral songs, and you didn't weep.'", "33": "For John the Baptist didn't spend his time eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, 'He's possessed by a demon.'", "34": "The Son of Man,[f] on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, 'He's a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!'", "35": "But wisdom is shown to be right by the lives of those who follow it.[g]\u201d", "36": "One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat.[h]", "37": "When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume.", "38": "Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.", "39": "When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \u201cIf this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She's a sinner!\u201d", "40": "Then Jesus answered his thoughts. \u201cSimon,\u201d he said to the Pharisee, \u201cI have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cGo ahead, Teacher,\u201d Simon replied.", "41": "Then Jesus told him this story: \u201cA man loaned money to two people\u2014500 pieces of silver[i] to one and 50 pieces to the other.", "42": "But neither of them could repay him, so he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts. Who do you suppose loved him more after that?\u201d", "43": "Simon answered, \u201cI suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt.\u201d \u201cThat's right,\u201d Jesus said.", "44": "Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, \u201cLook at this woman kneeling here. When I entered your home, you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet, but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.", "45": "You didn't greet me with a kiss, but from the time I first came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.", "46": "You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head, but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume.", "47": "\u201cI tell you, her sins\u2014and they are many\u2014have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love.\u201d", "48": "Then Jesus said to the woman, \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d", "49": "The men at the table said among themselves, \u201cWho is this man, that he goes around forgiving sins?\u201d", "50": "And Jesus said to the woman, \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d"}

He took his twelve disciples with him,", "2": "along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases. Among them were Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons;", "3": "Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's business manager; Susanna; and many others who were contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples.", "4": "One day Jesus told a story in the form of a parable to a large crowd that had gathered from many towns to hear him:", "5": "\u201cA farmer went out to plant his seed. As he scattered it across his field, some seed fell on a footpath, where it was stepped on, and the birds ate it.", "6": "Other seed fell among rocks. It began to grow, but the plant soon wilted and died for lack of moisture.", "7": "Other seed fell among thorns that grew up with it and choked out the tender plants.", "8": "Still other seed fell on fertile soil. This seed grew and produced a crop that was a hundred times as much as had been planted!\u201d When he had said this, he called out, \u201cAnyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.\u201d", "9": "His disciples asked him what this parable meant.", "10": "He replied, \u201cYou are permitted to understand the secrets[a] of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables to teach the others so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled: 'When they look, they won't really see. When they hear, they won't understand.'[b]", "11": "\u201cThis is the meaning of the parable: The seed is God's word.", "12": "The seeds that fell on the footpath represent those who hear the message, only to have the devil come and take it away from their hearts and prevent them from believing and being saved.", "13": "The seeds on the rocky soil represent those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But since they don't have deep roots, they believe for a while, then they fall away when they face temptation.", "14": "The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into maturity.", "15": "And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God's word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.", "16": "\u201cNo one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.", "17": "For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.", "18": "\u201cSo pay attention to how you hear. To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what they think they understand will be taken away from them.\u201d", "19": "Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they couldn't get to him because of the crowd.", "20": "Someone told Jesus, \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to see you.\u201d", "21": "Jesus replied, \u201cMy mother and my brothers are all those who hear God's word and obey it.\u201d", "22": "One day Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cLet's cross to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they got into a boat and started out.", "23": "As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap.

The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger.", "24": "The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, \u201cMaster, Master, we're going to drown!\u201d When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm.", "25": "Then he asked them, \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d The disciples were terrified and amazed. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d they asked each other. \u201cWhen he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!\u201d", "26": "So they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes,[c] across the lake from Galilee.", "27": "As Jesus was climbing out of the boat, a man who was possessed by demons came out to meet him. For a long time he had been homeless and naked, living in the tombs outside the town.", "28": "As soon as he saw Jesus, he shrieked and fell down in front of him. Then he screamed, \u201cWhy are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please, I beg you, don't torture me!\u201d", "29": "For Jesus had already commanded the evil[d] spirit to come out of him. This spirit had often taken control of the man. Even when he was placed under guard and put in chains and shackles, he simply broke them and rushed out into the wilderness, completely under the demon's power.", "30": "Jesus demanded, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cLegion,\u201d he replied, for he was filled with many demons.", "31": "The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit.[e]", "32": "There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby, and the demons begged him to let them enter into the pigs. So Jesus gave them permission.", "33": "Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.", "34": "When the herdsmen saw it, they fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran.", "35": "People rushed out to see what had happened. A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been freed from the demons.

So Jesus returned to the boat and left, crossing back to the other side of the lake.", "38": "The man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him home, saying,", "39": "\u201cNo, go back to your family, and tell them everything God has done for you.\u201d So he went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him.", "40": "On the other side of the lake the crowds welcomed Jesus, because they had been waiting for him.", "41": "Then a man named Jairus, a leader of the local synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come home with him.", "42": "His only daughter,[f] who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus went with him, he was surrounded by the crowds.", "43": "A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding,[g] and she could find no cure.", "44": "Coming up behind Jesus, she touched the fringe of his robe. Immediately, the bleeding stopped.", "45": "\u201cWho touched me?\u201d Jesus asked. Everyone denied it, and Peter said, \u201cMaster, this whole crowd is pressing up against you.\u201d", "46": "But Jesus said, \u201cSomeone deliberately touched me, for I felt healing power go out from me.\u201d", "47": "When the woman realized that she could not stay hidden, she began to tremble and fell to her knees in front of him. The whole crowd heard her explain why she had touched him and that she had been immediately healed.", "48": "\u201cDaughter,\u201d he said to her, \u201cyour faith has made you well. Go in peace.\u201d", "49": "While he was still speaking to her, a messenger arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. He told him, \u201cYour daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now.\u201d", "50": "But when Jesus heard what had happened, he said to Jairus, \u201cDon't be afraid. Just have faith, and she will be healed.\u201d", "51": "When they arrived at the house, Jesus wouldn't let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the little girl's father and mother.", "52": "The house was filled with people weeping and wailing, but he said, \u201cStop the weeping! She isn't dead; she's only asleep.\u201d", "53": "But the crowd laughed at him because they all knew she had died.", "54": "Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice, \u201cMy child, get up!\u201d", "55": "And at that moment her life[h] returned, and she immediately stood up! Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.", "56": "Her parents were overwhelmed, but Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone what had happened."}

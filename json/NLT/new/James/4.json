Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it.", "3": "And even when you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong\u2014you want only what will give you pleasure.", "4": "You adulterers![a] Don't you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God?

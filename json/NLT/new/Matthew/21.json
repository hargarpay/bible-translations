He is humble, riding on a donkey\u2014 riding on a donkey's colt.'\u201d[b]", "6": "The two disciples did as Jesus commanded.", "7": "They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt, and he sat on it.[c]", "8": "Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.", "9": "Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting,  \u201cPraise God[d] for the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise God in highest heaven!\u201d[e]", "10": "The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered. \u201cWho is this?\u201d they asked.", "11": "And the crowds replied, \u201cIt's Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.\u201d", "12": "Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.", "13": "He said to them, \u201cThe Scriptures declare, 'My Temple will be called a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves!\u201d[f]", "14": "The blind and the lame came to him in the Temple, and he healed them.", "15": "The leading priests and the teachers of religious law saw these wonderful miracles and heard even the children in the Temple shouting, \u201cPraise God for the Son of David.\u201d But the leaders were indignant.", "16": "They asked Jesus, \u201cDo you hear what these children are saying?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cHaven't you ever read the Scriptures?

A certain landowner planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a lookout tower.

'The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.

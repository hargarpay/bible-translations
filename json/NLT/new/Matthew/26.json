If this cup cannot be taken away[f] unless I drink it, your will be done.\u201d", "43": "When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn't keep their eyes open.", "44": "So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again.", "45": "Then he came to the disciples and said, \u201cGo ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look\u2014the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.", "46": "Up, let's be going. Look, my betrayer is here!\u201d", "47": "And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs.

Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.", "56": "But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures.\u201d At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.", "57": "Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered.", "58": "Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.", "59": "Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council[h] were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death.", "60": "But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone's testimony. Finally, two men came forward", "61": "who declared, \u201cThis man said, 'I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\u201d", "62": "Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \u201cWell, aren't you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d", "63": "But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, \u201cI demand in the name of the living God\u2014tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.\u201d", "64": "Jesus replied, \u201cYou have said it. And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God's right hand[i] and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d[j]", "65": "Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, \u201cBlasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy.", "66": "What is your verdict?\u201d \u201cGuilty!\u201d they shouted. \u201cHe deserves to die!\u201d", "67": "Then they began to spit in Jesus' face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him,", "68": "jeering, \u201cProphesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?\u201d", "69": "Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, \u201cYou were one of those with Jesus the Galilean.\u201d", "70": "But Peter denied it in front of everyone. \u201cI don't know what you're talking about,\u201d he said.", "71": "Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, \u201cThis man was with Jesus of Nazareth.[k]\u201d", "72": "Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. \u201cI don't even know the man,\u201d he said.", "73": "A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, \u201cYou must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent.\u201d", "74": "Peter swore, \u201cA curse on me if I'm lying\u2014I don't know the man!\u201d And immediately the rooster crowed.", "75": "Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: \u201cBefore the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.\u201d And he went away, weeping bitterly."}

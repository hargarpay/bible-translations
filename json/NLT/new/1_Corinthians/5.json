{"1": "I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you\u2014something that even pagans don't do. I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother.[a]", "2": "You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame. And you should remove this man from your fellowship.", "3": "Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit.[b] And as though I were there, I have already passed judgment on this man", "4": "in the name of the Lord Jesus. You must call a meeting of the church.[c] I will be present with you in spirit, and so will the power of our Lord Jesus.", "5": "Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed[d] and he himself[e] will be saved on the day the Lord[f] returns.", "6": "Your boasting about this is terrible. Don't you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough?", "7": "Get rid of the old \u201cyeast\u201d by removing this wicked person from among you. Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.[g]", "8": "So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread[h] of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread[i] of sincerity and truth.", "9": "When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin.", "10": "But I wasn't talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that.", "11": "I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer[j] yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don't even eat with such people.", "12": "It isn't my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning.", "13": "God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, \u201cYou must remove the evil person from among you.\u201d[k]"}

{"1": "\u201cBrothers and esteemed fathers,\u201d Paul said, \u201clisten to me as I offer my defense.\u201d", "2": "When they heard him speaking in their own language,[a] the silence was even greater.", "3": "Then Paul said, \u201cI am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, and I was brought up and educated here in Jerusalem under Gamaliel. As his student, I was carefully trained in our Jewish laws and customs. I became very zealous to honor God in everything I did, just like all of you today.", "4": "And I persecuted the followers of the Way, hounding some to death, arresting both men and women and throwing them in prison.", "5": "The high priest and the whole council of elders can testify that this is so. For I received letters from them to our Jewish brothers in Damascus, authorizing me to bring the followers of the Way from there to Jerusalem, in chains, to be punished.", "6": "\u201cAs I was on the road, approaching Damascus about noon, a very bright light from heaven suddenly shone down around me.", "7": "I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'", "8": "\u201c'Who are you, lord?' I asked. \u201cAnd the voice replied, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene,[b] the one you are persecuting.'", "9": "The people with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice speaking to me.", "10": "\u201cI asked, 'What should I do, Lord?' \u201cAnd the Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything you are to do.'", "11": "\u201cI was blinded by the intense light and had to be led by the hand to Damascus by my companions.", "12": "A man named Ananias lived there. He was a godly man, deeply devoted to the law, and well regarded by all the Jews of Damascus.", "13": "He came and stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And that very moment I could see him!", "14": "\u201cThen he told me, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and hear him speak.", "15": "For you are to be his witness, telling everyone what you have seen and heard.", "16": "What are you waiting for? Get up and be baptized. Have your sins washed away by calling on the name of the Lord.'", "17": "\u201cAfter I returned to Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple and fell into a trance.", "18": "I saw a vision of Jesus[c] saying to me, 'Hurry! Leave Jerusalem, for the people here won't accept your testimony about me.'", "19": "\u201c'But Lord,' I argued, 'they certainly know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.", "20": "And I was in complete agreement when your witness Stephen was killed. I stood by and kept the coats they took off when they stoned him.'", "21": "\u201cBut the Lord said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles!'\u201d", "22": "The crowd listened until Paul said that word. Then they all began to shout, \u201cAway with such a fellow! He isn't fit to live!\u201d", "23": "They yelled, threw off their coats, and tossed handfuls of dust into the air.", "24": "The commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime. He wanted to find out why the crowd had become so furious.", "25": "When they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer[d] standing there, \u201cIs it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?\u201d", "26": "When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!\u201d", "27": "So the commander went over and asked Paul, \u201cTell me, are you a Roman citizen?\u201d \u201cYes, I certainly am,\u201d Paul replied.", "28": "\u201cI am, too,\u201d the commander muttered, \u201cand it cost me plenty!\u201d Paul answered, \u201cBut I am a citizen by birth!\u201d", "29": "The soldiers who were about to interrogate Paul quickly withdrew when they heard he was a Roman citizen, and the commander was frightened because he had ordered him bound and whipped.", "30": "The next day the commander ordered the leading priests into session with the Jewish high council.[e] He wanted to find out what the trouble was all about, so he released Paul to have him stand before them."}

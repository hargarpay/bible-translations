Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.[a]", "3": "God told him, 'Leave your native land and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.'[b]", "4": "So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran until his father died. Then God brought him here to the land where you now live.", "5": "\u201cBut God gave him no inheritance here, not even one square foot of land. God did promise, however, that eventually the whole land would belong to Abraham and his descendants\u2014even though he had no children yet.", "6": "God also told him that his descendants would live in a foreign land, where they would be oppressed as slaves for 400 years.", "7": "'But I will punish the nation that enslaves them,' God said, 'and in the end they will come out and worship me here in this place.'[c]", "8": "\u201cGod also gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision at that time.

{"1": "[a]David went to the town of Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he saw him. \u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy is no one with you?\u201d", "2": "\u201cThe king has sent me on a private matter,\u201d David said. \u201cHe told me not to tell anyone why I am here. I have told my men where to meet me later.", "3": "Now, what is there to eat? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have.\u201d", "4": "\u201cWe don't have any regular bread,\u201d the priest replied. \u201cBut there is the holy bread, which you can have if your young men have not slept with any women recently.\u201d", "5": "\u201cDon't worry,\u201d David replied. \u201cI never allow my men to be with women when we are on a campaign. And since they stay clean even on ordinary trips, how much more on this one!\u201d", "6": "Since there was no other food available, the priest gave him the holy bread\u2014the Bread of the Presence that was placed before the Lord in the Tabernacle. It had just been replaced that day with fresh bread.", "7": "Now Doeg the Edomite, Saul's chief herdsman, was there that day, having been detained before the Lord.[b]", "8": "David asked Ahimelech, \u201cDo you have a spear or sword? The king's business was so urgent that I didn't even have time to grab a weapon!\u201d", "9": "\u201cI only have the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah,\u201d the priest replied. \u201cIt is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. Take that if you want it, for there is nothing else here.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing like it!\u201d David replied. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d", "10": "So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath.", "11": "But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there. \u201cIsn't this David, the king of the land?\u201d they asked. \u201cIsn't he the one the people honor with dances, singing, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?\u201d", "12": "David heard these comments and was very afraid of what King Achish of Gath might do to him.", "13": "So he pretended to be insane, scratching on doors and drooling down his beard.", "14": "Finally, King Achish said to his men, \u201cMust you bring me a madman?", "15": "We already have enough of them around here! Why should I let someone like this be my guest?\u201d"}

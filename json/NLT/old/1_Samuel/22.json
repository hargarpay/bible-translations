Has he promised to make you all generals and captains in his army?[a]", "8": "Is that why you have conspired against me? For not one of you told me when my own son made a solemn pact with the son of Jesse. You're not even sorry for me. Think of it! My own son\u2014encouraging him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day!\u201d", "9": "Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there with Saul's men, spoke up. \u201cWhen I was at Nob,\u201d he said, \u201cI saw the son of Jesse talking to the priest, Ahimelech son of Ahitub.", "10": "Ahimelech consulted the Lord for him.

Why have you consulted God for him? Why have you encouraged him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day?\u201d", "14": "\u201cBut sir,\u201d Ahimelech replied, \u201cis anyone among all your servants as faithful as David, your son-in-law? Why, he is the captain of your bodyguard and a highly honored member of your household!", "15": "This was certainly not the first time I had consulted God for him! May the king not accuse me and my family in this matter, for I knew nothing at all of any plot against you.\u201d", "16": "\u201cYou will surely die, Ahimelech, along with your entire family!\u201d the king shouted.", "17": "And he ordered his bodyguards, \u201cKill these priests of the Lord, for they are allies and conspirators with David!

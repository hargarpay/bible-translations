{"1": "There was a wealthy, influential man named Kish from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, of the tribe of Benjamin.", "2": "His son Saul was the most handsome man in Israel\u2014head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the land.", "3": "One day Kish's donkeys strayed away, and he told Saul, \u201cTake a servant with you, and go look for the donkeys.\u201d", "4": "So Saul took one of the servants and traveled through the hill country of Ephraim, the land of Shalishah, the Shaalim area, and the entire land of Benjamin, but they couldn't find the donkeys anywhere.", "5": "Finally, they entered the region of Zuph, and Saul said to his servant, \u201cLet's go home. By now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys!\u201d", "6": "But the servant said, \u201cI've just thought of something! There is a man of God who lives here in this town. He is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true. Let's go find him. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.\u201d", "7": "\u201cBut we don't have anything to offer him,\u201d Saul replied. \u201cEven our food is gone, and we don't have a thing to give him.\u201d", "8": "\u201cWell,\u201d the servant said, \u201cI have one small silver piece.[a] We can at least offer it to the man of God and see what happens!\u201d", "9": "(In those days if people wanted a message from God, they would say, \u201cLet's go and ask the seer,\u201d for prophets used to be called seers.)", "10": "\u201cAll right,\u201d Saul agreed, \u201clet's try it!\u201d So they started into the town where the man of God lived.", "11": "As they were climbing the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water. So Saul and his servant asked, \u201cIs the seer here today?\u201d", "12": "\u201cYes,\u201d they replied. \u201cStay right on this road. He is at the town gates. He has just arrived to take part in a public sacrifice up at the place of worship.", "13": "Hurry and catch him before he goes up there to eat. The guests won't begin eating until he arrives to bless the food.\u201d", "14": "So they entered the town, and as they passed through the gates, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the place of worship.", "15": "Now the Lord had told Samuel the previous day,", "16": "\u201cAbout this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him to be the leader of my people, Israel. He will rescue them from the Philistines, for I have looked down on my people in mercy and have heard their cry.\u201d", "17": "When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said, \u201cThat's the man I told you about! He will rule my people.\u201d", "18": "Just then Saul approached Samuel at the gateway and asked, \u201cCan you please tell me where the seer's house is?\u201d", "19": "\u201cI am the seer!\u201d Samuel replied. \u201cGo up to the place of worship ahead of me. We will eat there together, and in the morning I'll tell you what you want to know and send you on your way.", "20": "And don't worry about those donkeys that were lost three days ago, for they have been found. And I am here to tell you that you and your family are the focus of all Israel's hopes.\u201d", "21": "Saul replied, \u201cBut I'm only from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important of all the families of that tribe! Why are you talking like this to me?\u201d", "22": "Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and placed them at the head of the table, honoring them above the thirty special guests.", "23": "Samuel then instructed the cook to bring Saul the finest cut of meat, the piece that had been set aside for the guest of honor.", "24": "So the cook brought in the meat and placed it before Saul. \u201cGo ahead and eat it,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cI was saving it for you even before I invited these others!\u201d So Saul ate with Samuel that day.", "25": "When they came down from the place of worship and returned to town, Samuel took Saul up to the roof of the house and prepared a bed for him there.[b]", "26": "At daybreak the next morning, Samuel called to Saul, \u201cGet up! It's time you were on your way.\u201d So Saul got ready, and he and Samuel left the house together.", "27": "When they reached the edge of town, Samuel told Saul to send his servant on ahead. After the servant was gone, Samuel said, \u201cStay here, for I have received a special message for you from God.\u201d"}

There he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.\u201d For the Lord's teaching will go out from Zion; his word will go out from Jerusalem.", "3": "The Lord will mediate between peoples and will settle disputes between strong nations far away. They will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.

Many of the men are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.\u201d", "5": "\u201cHow do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?\u201d David demanded of the young man.", "6": "The man answered, \u201cI happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the enemy chariots and charioteers closing in on him.", "7": "When he turned and saw me, he cried out for me to come to him. 'How can I help?' I asked him.", "8": "\u201cHe responded, 'Who are you?' \u201c'I am an Amalekite,' I told him.", "9": "\u201cThen he begged me, 'Come over here and put me out of my misery, for I am in terrible pain and want to die.'", "10": "\u201cSo I killed him,\u201d the Amalekite told David, \u201cfor I knew he couldn't live.

And the Lord told you, 'You will be the shepherd of my people Israel. You will be Israel's leader.'\u201d", "3": "So there at Hebron, King David made a covenant before the Lord with all the elders of Israel.

Even the blind and lame could keep you out!\u201d For the Jebusites thought they were safe.", "7": "But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.", "8": "On the day of the attack, David said to his troops, \u201cI hate those 'lame' and 'blind' Jebusites.[b] Whoever attacks them should strike by going into the city through the water tunnel.[c]\u201d That is the origin of the saying, \u201cThe blind and the lame may not enter the house.\u201d[d]", "9": "So David made the fortress his home, and he called it the City of David. He extended the city, starting at the supporting terraces[e] and working inward.", "10": "And David became more and more powerful, because the Lord God of Heaven's Armies was with him.", "11": "Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built David a palace.", "12": "And David realized that the Lord had confirmed him as king over Israel and had blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.", "13": "After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David married more concubines and wives, and they had more sons and daughters.", "14": "These are the names of David's sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,", "15": "Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,", "16": "Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.", "17": "When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him.

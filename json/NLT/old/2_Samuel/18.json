{"1": "David now mustered the men who were with him and appointed generals and captains[a] to lead them.", "2": "He sent the troops out in three groups, placing one group under Joab, one under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one under Ittai, the man from Gath. The king told his troops, \u201cI am going out with you.\u201d", "3": "But his men objected strongly. \u201cYou must not go,\u201d they urged. \u201cIf we have to turn and run\u2014and even if half of us die\u2014it will make no difference to Absalom's troops; they will be looking only for you. You are worth 10,000 of us,[b] and it is better that you stay here in the town and send help if we need it.\u201d", "4": "\u201cIf you think that's the best plan, I'll do it,\u201d the king answered. So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.", "5": "And the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: \u201cFor my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.\u201d And all the troops heard the king give this order to his commanders.", "6": "So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim,", "7": "and the Israelite troops were beaten back by David's men. There was a great slaughter that day, and 20,000 men laid down their lives.", "8": "The battle raged all across the countryside, and more men died because of the forest than were killed by the sword.", "9": "During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David's men. He tried to escape on his mule, but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree, his hair[c] got caught in the tree. His mule kept going and left him dangling in the air.", "10": "One of David's men saw what had happened and told Joab, \u201cI saw Absalom dangling from a great tree.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWhat?\u201d Joab demanded. \u201cYou saw him there and didn't kill him? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver[d] and a hero's belt!\u201d", "12": "\u201cI would not kill the king's son for even a thousand pieces of silver,[e]\u201d the man replied to Joab. \u201cWe all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake, please spare young Absalom.'", "13": "And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son\u2014and the king would certainly find out who did it\u2014you yourself would be the first to abandon me.\u201d", "14": "\u201cEnough of this nonsense,\u201d Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom's heart as he dangled, still alive, in the great tree.", "15": "Ten of Joab's young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him.", "16": "Then Joab blew the ram's horn, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel.", "17": "They threw Absalom's body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And all Israel fled to their homes.", "18": "During his lifetime, Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King's Valley, for he said, \u201cI have no son to carry on my name.\u201d He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom's Monument to this day.", "19": "Then Zadok's son Ahimaaz said, \u201cLet me run to the king with the good news that the Lord has rescued him from his enemies.\u201d", "20": "\u201cNo,\u201d Joab told him, \u201cit wouldn't be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today.\u201d", "21": "Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia,[f] \u201cGo tell the king what you have seen.\u201d The man bowed and ran off.", "22": "But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, \u201cWhatever happens, please let me go, too.\u201d \u201cWhy should you go, my son?\u201d Joab replied. \u201cThere will be no reward for your news.\u201d", "23": "\u201cYes, but let me go anyway,\u201d he begged. Joab finally said, \u201cAll right, go ahead.\u201d So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.", "24": "While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them.", "25": "He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, \u201cIf he is alone, he has news.\u201d As the messenger came closer,", "26": "the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, \u201cHere comes another one!\u201d The king replied, \u201cHe also will have news.\u201d", "27": "\u201cThe first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok,\u201d the watchman said. \u201cHe is a good man and comes with good news,\u201d the king replied.", "28": "Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, \u201cEverything is all right!\u201d He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, \u201cPraise to the Lord your God, who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king.\u201d", "29": "\u201cWhat about young Absalom?\u201d the king demanded. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d Ahimaaz replied, \u201cWhen Joab told me to come, there was a lot of commotion. But I didn't know what was happening.\u201d", "30": "\u201cWait here,\u201d the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.", "31": "Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said, \u201cI have good news for my lord the king. Today the Lord has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you.\u201d", "32": "\u201cWhat about young Absalom?\u201d the king demanded. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d And the Ethiopian replied, \u201cMay all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!\u201d", "33": "[g]The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, \u201cO my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.\u201d"}

Every last one of you will be dragged away like a fish on a hook!", "3": "You will be led out through the ruins of the wall; you will be thrown from your fortresses,[b]\u201d says the Lord.", "4": "\u201cGo ahead and offer sacrifices to the idols at Bethel. Keep on disobeying at Gilgal. Offer sacrifices each morning, and bring your tithes every three days.", "5": "Present your bread made with yeast as an offering of thanksgiving. Then give your extra voluntary offerings so you can brag about it everywhere! This is the kind of thing you Israelites love to do,\u201d says the Sovereign Lord.", "6": "\u201cI brought hunger to every city and famine to every town. But still you would not return to me,\u201d says the Lord.", "7": "\u201cI kept the rain from falling when your crops needed it the most. I sent rain on one town but withheld it from another.

Those of you who survived were like charred sticks pulled from a fire.

Prepare to meet your God in judgment, you people of Israel!\u201d", "13": "For the Lord is the one who shaped the mountains, stirs up the winds, and reveals his thoughts to mankind. He turns the light of dawn into darkness and treads on the heights of the earth. The Lord God of Heaven's Armies is his name!"}

{"1": "One day the group of prophets came to Elisha and told him, \u201cAs you can see, this place where we meet with you is too small.", "2": "Let's go down to the Jordan River, where there are plenty of logs. There we can build a new place for us to meet.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he told them, \u201cgo ahead.\u201d", "3": "\u201cPlease come with us,\u201d someone suggested. \u201cI will,\u201d he said.", "4": "So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees.", "5": "But as one of them was cutting a tree, his ax head fell into the river. \u201cOh, sir!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt was a borrowed ax!\u201d", "6": "\u201cWhere did it fall?\u201d the man of God asked. When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. Then the ax head floated to the surface.", "7": "\u201cGrab it,\u201d Elisha said. And the man reached out and grabbed it.", "8": "When the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he would confer with his officers and say, \u201cWe will mobilize our forces at such and such a place.\u201d", "9": "But immediately Elisha, the man of God, would warn the king of Israel, \u201cDo not go near that place, for the Arameans are planning to mobilize their troops there.\u201d", "10": "So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he would be on the alert there.", "11": "The king of Aram became very upset over this. He called his officers together and demanded, \u201cWhich of you is the traitor? Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans?\u201d", "12": "\u201cIt's not us, my lord the king,\u201d one of the officers replied. \u201cElisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom!\u201d", "13": "\u201cGo and find out where he is,\u201d the king commanded, \u201cso I can send troops to seize him.\u201d And the report came back: \u201cElisha is at Dothan.\u201d", "14": "So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city.", "15": "When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. \u201cOh, sir, what will we do now?\u201d the young man cried to Elisha.", "16": "\u201cDon't be afraid!\u201d Elisha told him. \u201cFor there are more on our side than on theirs!\u201d", "17": "Then Elisha prayed, \u201cO Lord, open his eyes and let him see!\u201d The Lord opened the young man's eyes, and when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire.", "18": "As the Aramean army advanced toward him, Elisha prayed, \u201cO Lord, please make them blind.\u201d So the Lord struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.", "19": "Then Elisha went out and told them, \u201cYou have come the wrong way! This isn't the right city! Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are looking for.\u201d And he led them to the city of Samaria.", "20": "As soon as they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed, \u201cO Lord, now open their eyes and let them see.\u201d So the Lord opened their eyes, and they discovered that they were in the middle of Samaria.", "21": "When the king of Israel saw them, he shouted to Elisha, \u201cMy father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?\u201d", "22": "\u201cOf course not!\u201d Elisha replied. \u201cDo we kill prisoners of war? Give them food and drink and send them home again to their master.\u201d", "23": "So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their master. After that, the Aramean raiders stayed away from the land of Israel.", "24": "Some time later, however, King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army and besieged Samaria.", "25": "As a result, there was a great famine in the city. The siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a cup of dove's dung sold for five pieces[a] of silver.", "26": "One day as the king of Israel was walking along the wall of the city, a woman called to him, \u201cPlease help me, my lord the king!\u201d", "27": "He answered, \u201cIf the Lord doesn't help you, what can I do? I have neither food from the threshing floor nor wine from the press to give you.\u201d", "28": "But then the king asked, \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d She replied, \u201cThis woman said to me: 'Come on, let's eat your son today, then we will eat my son tomorrow.'", "29": "So we cooked my son and ate him. Then the next day I said to her, 'Kill your son so we can eat him,' but she has hidden her son.\u201d", "30": "When the king heard this, he tore his clothes in despair. And as the king walked along the wall, the people could see that he was wearing burlap under his robe next to his skin.", "31": "\u201cMay God strike me and even kill me if I don't separate Elisha's head from his shoulders this very day,\u201d the king vowed.", "32": "Elisha was sitting in his house with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, \u201cA murderer has sent a man to cut off my head. When he arrives, shut the door and keep him out. We will soon hear his master's steps following him.\u201d", "33": "While Elisha was still saying this, the messenger arrived. And the king[b] said, \u201cAll this misery is from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?\u201d"}

{"1": "One day the widow of a member of the group of prophets came to Elisha and cried out, \u201cMy husband who served you is dead, and you know how he feared the Lord. But now a creditor has come, threatening to take my two sons as slaves.\u201d", "2": "\u201cWhat can I do to help you?\u201d Elisha asked. \u201cTell me, what do you have in the house?\u201d \u201cNothing at all, except a flask of olive oil,\u201d she replied.", "3": "And Elisha said, \u201cBorrow as many empty jars as you can from your friends and neighbors.", "4": "Then go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you. Pour olive oil from your flask into the jars, setting each one aside when it is filled.\u201d", "5": "So she did as she was told. Her sons kept bringing jars to her, and she filled one after another.", "6": "Soon every container was full to the brim! \u201cBring me another jar,\u201d she said to one of her sons. \u201cThere aren't any more!\u201d he told her. And then the olive oil stopped flowing.", "7": "When she told the man of God what had happened, he said to her, \u201cNow sell the olive oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on what is left over.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she urged him to come to her home for a meal. After that, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for something to eat.", "9": "She said to her husband, \u201cI am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God.", "10": "Let's build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by.\u201d", "11": "One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to this upper room to rest.", "12": "He said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cTell the woman from Shunem I want to speak to her.\u201d When she appeared,", "13": "Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cTell her, 'We appreciate the kind concern you have shown us. What can we do for you? Can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army?'\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cmy family takes good care of me.\u201d", "14": "Later Elisha asked Gehazi, \u201cWhat can we do for her?\u201d Gehazi replied, \u201cShe doesn't have a son, and her husband is an old man.\u201d", "15": "\u201cCall her back again,\u201d Elisha told him. When the woman returned, Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway,", "16": "\u201cNext year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms!\u201d \u201cNo, my lord!\u201d she cried. \u201cO man of God, don't deceive me and get my hopes up like that.\u201d", "17": "But sure enough, the woman soon became pregnant. And at that time the following year she had a son, just as Elisha had said.", "18": "One day when her child was older, he went out to help his father, who was working with the harvesters.", "19": "Suddenly he cried out, \u201cMy head hurts! My head hurts!\u201d His father said to one of the servants, \u201cCarry him home to his mother.\u201d", "20": "So the servant took him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But around noontime he died.", "21": "She carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and left him there.", "22": "She sent a message to her husband: \u201cSend one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the man of God and come right back.\u201d", "23": "\u201cWhy go today?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath.\u201d But she said, \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d", "24": "So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant, \u201cHurry! Don't slow down unless I tell you to.\u201d", "25": "As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to Gehazi, \u201cLook, the woman from Shunem is coming.", "26": "Run out to meet her and ask her, 'Is everything all right with you, your husband, and your child?'\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d the woman told Gehazi, \u201ceverything is fine.\u201d", "27": "But when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet. Gehazi began to push her away, but the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone. She is deeply troubled, but the Lord has not told me what it is.\u201d", "28": "Then she said, \u201cDid I ask you for a son, my lord? And didn't I say, 'Don't deceive me and get my hopes up'?\u201d", "29": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cGet ready to travel[a]; take my staff and go! Don't talk to anyone along the way. Go quickly and lay the staff on the child's face.\u201d", "30": "But the boy's mother said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I won't go home unless you go with me.\u201d So Elisha returned with her.", "31": "Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child's face, but nothing happened. There was no sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, \u201cThe child is still dead.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha arrived, the child was indeed dead, lying there on the prophet's bed.", "33": "He went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the Lord.", "34": "Then he lay down on the child's body, placing his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on the child's eyes, and his hands on the child's hands. And as he stretched out on him, the child's body began to grow warm again!", "35": "Elisha got up, walked back and forth across the room once, and then stretched himself out again on the child. This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!", "36": "Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. \u201cCall the child's mother!\u201d he said. And when she came in, Elisha said, \u201cHere, take your son!\u201d", "37": "She fell at his feet and bowed before him, overwhelmed with gratitude. Then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs.", "38": "Elisha now returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. One day as the group of prophets was seated before him, he said to his servant, \u201cPut a large pot on the fire, and make some stew for the rest of the group.\u201d", "39": "One of the young men went out into the field to gather herbs and came back with a pocketful of wild gourds. He shredded them and put them into the pot without realizing they were poisonous.", "40": "Some of the stew was served to the men. But after they had eaten a bite or two they cried out, \u201cMan of God, there's poison in this stew!\u201d So they would not eat it.", "41": "Elisha said, \u201cBring me some flour.\u201d Then he threw it into the pot and said, \u201cNow it's all right; go ahead and eat.\u201d And then it did not harm them.", "42": "One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought the man of God a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest. Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people so they can eat.\u201d", "43": "\u201cWhat?\u201d his servant exclaimed. \u201cFeed a hundred people with only this?\u201d But Elisha repeated, \u201cGive it to the people so they can eat, for this is what the Lord says: Everyone will eat, and there will even be some left over!\u201d", "44": "And when they gave it to the people, there was plenty for all and some left over, just as the Lord had promised."}

{"1": "Elisha replied, \u201cListen to this message from the Lord! This is what the Lord says: By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, six quarts of choice flour will cost only one piece of silver,[a] and twelve quarts of barley grain will cost only one piece of silver.[b]\u201d", "2": "The officer assisting the king said to the man of God, \u201cThat couldn't happen even if the Lord opened the windows of heaven!\u201d But Elisha replied, \u201cYou will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won't be able to eat any of it!\u201d", "3": "Now there were four men with leprosy[c] sitting at the entrance of the city gates. \u201cWhy should we sit here waiting to die?\u201d they asked each other.", "4": "\u201cWe will starve if we stay here, but with the famine in the city, we will starve if we go back there. So we might as well go out and surrender to the Aramean army. If they let us live, so much the better. But if they kill us, we would have died anyway.\u201d", "5": "So at twilight they set out for the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the edge of the camp, no one was there!", "6": "For the Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the clatter of speeding chariots and the galloping of horses and the sounds of a great army approaching. \u201cThe king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians[d] to attack us!\u201d they cried to one another.", "7": "So they panicked and ran into the night, abandoning their tents, horses, donkeys, and everything else, as they fled for their lives.", "8": "When the men with leprosy arrived at the edge of the camp, they went into one tent after another, eating and drinking wine; and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and hid it.", "9": "Finally, they said to each other, \u201cThis is not right. This is a day of good news, and we aren't sharing it with anyone! If we wait until morning, some calamity will certainly fall upon us. Come on, let's go back and tell the people at the palace.\u201d", "10": "So they went back to the city and told the gatekeepers what had happened. \u201cWe went out to the Aramean camp,\u201d they said, \u201cand no one was there! The horses and donkeys were tethered and the tents were all in order, but there wasn't a single person around!\u201d", "11": "Then the gatekeepers shouted the news to the people in the palace.", "12": "The king got out of bed in the middle of the night and told his officers, \u201cI know what has happened. The Arameans know we are starving, so they have left their camp and have hidden in the fields. They are expecting us to leave the city, and then they will take us alive and capture the city.\u201d", "13": "One of his officers replied, \u201cWe had better send out scouts to check into this. Let them take five of the remaining horses. If something happens to them, it will be no worse than if they stay here and die with the rest of us.\u201d", "14": "So two chariots with horses were prepared, and the king sent scouts to see what had happened to the Aramean army.", "15": "They went all the way to the Jordan River, following a trail of clothing and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their mad rush to escape. The scouts returned and told the king about it.", "16": "Then the people of Samaria rushed out and plundered the Aramean camp. So it was true that six quarts of choice flour were sold that day for one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain were sold for one piece of silver, just as the Lord had promised.", "17": "The king appointed his officer to control the traffic at the gate, but he was knocked down and trampled to death as the people rushed out. So everything happened exactly as the man of God had predicted when the king came to his house.", "18": "The man of God had said to the king, \u201cBy this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, six quarts of choice flour will cost one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain will cost one piece of silver.\u201d", "19": "The king's officer had replied, \u201cThat couldn't happen even if the Lord opened the windows of heaven!\u201d And the man of God had said, \u201cYou will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won't be able to eat any of it!\u201d", "20": "And so it was, for the people trampled him to death at the gate!"}

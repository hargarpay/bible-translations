{"1": "Ahab had seventy sons living in the city of Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the elders and officials of the city,[a] and to the guardians of King Ahab's sons. He said,", "2": "\u201cThe king's sons are with you, and you have at your disposal chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons. As soon as you receive this letter,", "3": "select the best qualified of your master's sons to be your king, and prepare to fight for Ahab's dynasty.\u201d", "4": "But they were paralyzed with fear and said, \u201cWe've seen that two kings couldn't stand against this man! What can we do?\u201d", "5": "So the palace and city administrators, together with the elders and the guardians of the king's sons, sent this message to Jehu: \u201cWe are your servants and will do anything you tell us. We will not make anyone king; do whatever you think is best.\u201d", "6": "Jehu responded with a second letter: \u201cIf you are on my side and are going to obey me, bring the heads of your master's sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.\u201d Now the seventy sons of the king were being cared for by the leaders of Samaria, where they had been raised since childhood.", "7": "When the letter arrived, the leaders killed all seventy of the king's sons. They placed their heads in baskets and presented them to Jehu at Jezreel.", "8": "A messenger went to Jehu and said, \u201cThey have brought the heads of the king's sons.\u201d So Jehu ordered, \u201cPile them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning.\u201d", "9": "In the morning he went out and spoke to the crowd that had gathered around them. \u201cYou are not to blame,\u201d he told them. \u201cI am the one who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?", "10": "You can be sure that the message of the Lord that was spoken concerning Ahab's family will not fail. The Lord declared through his servant Elijah that this would happen.\u201d", "11": "Then Jehu killed all who were left of Ahab's relatives living in Jezreel and all his important officials, his personal friends, and his priests. So Ahab was left without a single survivor.", "12": "Then Jehu set out for Samaria. Along the way, while he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,", "13": "he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked them. And they replied, \u201cWe are relatives of King Ahaziah. We are going to visit the sons of King Ahab and the sons of the queen mother.\u201d", "14": "\u201cTake them alive!\u201d Jehu shouted to his men. And they captured all forty-two of them and killed them at the well of Beth-eked. None of them escaped.", "15": "When Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab, who was coming to meet him. After they had greeted each other, Jehu said to him, \u201cAre you as loyal to me as I am to you?\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d Jehonadab replied. \u201cIf you are,\u201d Jehu said, \u201cthen give me your hand.\u201d So Jehonadab put out his hand, and Jehu helped him into the chariot.", "16": "Then Jehu said, \u201cNow come with me, and see how devoted I am to the Lord.\u201d So Jehonadab rode along with him.", "17": "When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he killed everyone who was left there from Ahab's family, just as the Lord had promised through Elijah.", "18": "Then Jehu called a meeting of all the people of the city and said to them, \u201cAhab's worship of Baal was nothing compared to the way I will worship him!", "19": "Therefore, summon all the prophets and worshipers of Baal, and call together all his priests. See to it that every one of them comes, for I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Baal. Anyone who fails to come will be put to death.\u201d But Jehu's cunning plan was to destroy all the worshipers of Baal.", "20": "Then Jehu ordered, \u201cPrepare a solemn assembly to worship Baal!\u201d So they did.", "21": "He sent messengers throughout all Israel summoning those who worshiped Baal. They all came\u2014not a single one remained behind\u2014and they filled the temple of Baal from one end to the other.", "22": "And Jehu instructed the keeper of the wardrobe, \u201cBe sure that every worshiper of Baal wears one of these robes.\u201d So robes were given to them.", "23": "Then Jehu went into the temple of Baal with Jehonadab son of Recab. Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal, \u201cMake sure no one who worships the Lord is here\u2014only those who worship Baal.\u201d", "24": "So they were all inside the temple to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the building and had warned them, \u201cIf you let anyone escape, you will pay for it with your own life.\u201d", "25": "As soon as Jehu had finished sacrificing the burnt offering, he commanded his guards and officers, \u201cGo in and kill all of them. Don't let a single one escape!\u201d So they killed them all with their swords, and the guards and officers dragged their bodies outside.[b] Then Jehu's men went into the innermost fortress[c] of the temple of Baal.", "26": "They dragged out the sacred pillar[d] used in the worship of Baal and burned it.", "27": "They smashed the sacred pillar and wrecked the temple of Baal, converting it into a public toilet, as it remains to this day.", "28": "In this way, Jehu destroyed every trace of Baal worship from Israel.", "29": "He did not, however, destroy the gold calves at Bethel and Dan, with which Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin.", "30": "Nonetheless the Lord said to Jehu, \u201cYou have done well in following my instructions to destroy the family of Ahab. Therefore, your descendants will be kings of Israel down to the fourth generation.\u201d", "31": "But Jehu did not obey the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He refused to turn from the sins that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit.", "32": "At about that time the Lord began to cut down the size of Israel's territory. King Hazael conquered several sections of the country", "33": "east of the Jordan River, including all of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh. He conquered the area from the town of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge to as far north as Gilead and Bashan.", "34": "The rest of the events in Jehu's reign\u2014everything he did and all his achievements\u2014are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.", "35": "When Jehu died, he was buried in Samaria. Then his son Jehoahaz became the next king.", "36": "In all, Jehu reigned over Israel from Samaria for twenty-eight years."}

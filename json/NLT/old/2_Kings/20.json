He gave the king this message: \u201cThis is what the Lord says: Set your affairs in order, for you are going to die. You will not recover from this illness.\u201d", "2": "When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,", "3": "\u201cRemember, O Lord, how I have always been faithful to you and have served you single-mindedly, always doing what pleases you.\u201d Then he broke down and wept bitterly.", "4": "But before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard,[a] this message came to him from the Lord:", "5": "\u201cGo back to Hezekiah, the leader of my people. Tell him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you, and three days from now you will get out of bed and go to the Temple of the Lord.", "6": "I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own honor and for the sake of my servant David.'\u201d", "7": "Then Isaiah said, \u201cMake an ointment from figs.\u201d So Hezekiah's servants spread the ointment over the boil, and Hezekiah recovered!", "8": "Meanwhile, Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, \u201cWhat sign will the Lord give to prove that he will heal me and that I will go to the Temple of the Lord three days from now?\u201d", "9": "Isaiah replied, \u201cThis is the sign from the Lord to prove that he will do as he promised. Would you like the shadow on the sundial to go forward ten steps or backward ten steps?[b]\u201d", "10": "\u201cThe shadow always moves forward,\u201d Hezekiah replied, \u201cso that would be easy. Make it go ten steps backward instead.\u201d", "11": "So Isaiah the prophet asked the Lord to do this, and he caused the shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial[c] of Ahaz!", "12": "Soon after this, Merodach-baladan[d] son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick.", "13": "Hezekiah received the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses\u2014the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.", "14": "Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, \u201cWhat did those men want? Where were they from?\u201d Hezekiah replied, \u201cThey came from the distant land of Babylon.\u201d", "15": "\u201cWhat did they see in your palace?\u201d Isaiah asked. \u201cThey saw everything,\u201d Hezekiah replied. \u201cI showed them everything I own\u2014all my royal treasuries.\u201d", "16": "Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, \u201cListen to this message from the Lord:", "17": "The time is coming when everything in your palace\u2014all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now\u2014will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord.", "18": "Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon's king.\u201d", "19": "Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \u201cThis message you have given me from the Lord is good.\u201d For the king was thinking, \u201cAt least there will be peace and security during my lifetime.\u201d", "20": "The rest of the events in Hezekiah's reign, including the extent of his power and how he built a pool and dug a tunnel[e] to bring water into the city, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.", "21": "Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh became the next king."}

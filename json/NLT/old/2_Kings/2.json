{"1": "When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.", "2": "And Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here, for the Lord has told me to go to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha replied, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you!\u201d So they went down together to Bethel.", "3": "The group of prophets from Bethel came to Elisha and asked him, \u201cDid you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d \u201cOf course I know,\u201d Elisha answered. \u201cBut be quiet about it.\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here, for the Lord has told me to go to Jericho.\u201d But Elisha replied again, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you.\u201d So they went on together to Jericho.", "5": "Then the group of prophets from Jericho came to Elisha and asked him, \u201cDid you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d \u201cOf course I know,\u201d Elisha answered. \u201cBut be quiet about it.\u201d", "6": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here, for the Lord has told me to go to the Jordan River.\u201d But again Elisha replied, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you.\u201d So they went on together.", "7": "Fifty men from the group of prophets also went and watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped beside the Jordan River.", "8": "Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it. The river divided, and the two of them went across on dry ground!", "9": "When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cTell me what I can do for you before I am taken away.\u201d And Elisha replied, \u201cPlease let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor.\u201d", "10": "\u201cYou have asked a difficult thing,\u201d Elijah replied. \u201cIf you see me when I am taken from you, then you will get your request. But if not, then you won't.\u201d", "11": "As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire appeared, drawn by horses of fire. It drove between the two men, separating them, and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven.", "12": "Elisha saw it and cried out, \u201cMy father! My father! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel!\u201d And as they disappeared from sight, Elisha tore his clothes in distress.", "13": "Elisha picked up Elijah's cloak, which had fallen when he was taken up. Then Elisha returned to the bank of the Jordan River.", "14": "He struck the water with Elijah's cloak and cried out, \u201cWhere is the Lord, the God of Elijah?\u201d Then the river divided, and Elisha went across.", "15": "When the group of prophets from Jericho saw from a distance what happened, they exclaimed, \u201cElijah's spirit rests upon Elisha!\u201d And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.", "16": "\u201cSir,\u201d they said, \u201cjust say the word and fifty of our strongest men will search the wilderness for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has left him on some mountain or in some valley.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Elisha said, \u201cdon't send them.\u201d", "17": "But they kept urging him until they shamed him into agreeing, and he finally said, \u201cAll right, send them.\u201d So fifty men searched for three days but did not find Elijah.", "18": "Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned. \u201cDidn't I tell you not to go?\u201d he asked.", "19": "One day the leaders of the town of Jericho visited Elisha. \u201cWe have a problem, my lord,\u201d they told him. \u201cThis town is located in pleasant surroundings, as you can see. But the water is bad, and the land is unproductive.\u201d", "20": "Elisha said, \u201cBring me a new bowl with salt in it.\u201d So they brought it to him.", "21": "Then he went out to the spring that supplied the town with water and threw the salt into it. And he said, \u201cThis is what the Lord says: I have purified this water. It will no longer cause death or infertility.[a]\u201d", "22": "And the water has remained pure ever since, just as Elisha said.", "23": "Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a group of boys from the town began mocking and making fun of him. \u201cGo away, baldy!\u201d they chanted. \u201cGo away, baldy!\u201d", "24": "Elisha turned around and looked at them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of them.", "25": "From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and finally returned to Samaria."}

{"1": "About this time, a man and woman from the tribe of Levi got married.", "2": "The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She saw that he was a special baby and kept him hidden for three months.", "3": "But when she could no longer hide him, she got a basket made of papyrus reeds and waterproofed it with tar and pitch. She put the baby in the basket and laid it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile River.", "4": "The baby's sister then stood at a distance, watching to see what would happen to him.", "5": "Soon Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe in the river, and her attendants walked along the riverbank. When the princess saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it for her.", "6": "When the princess opened it, she saw the baby. The little boy was crying, and she felt sorry for him. \u201cThis must be one of the Hebrew children,\u201d she said.", "7": "Then the baby's sister approached the princess. \u201cShould I go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?\u201d she asked.", "8": "\u201cYes, do!\u201d the princess replied. So the girl went and called the baby's mother.", "9": "\u201cTake this baby and nurse him for me,\u201d the princess told the baby's mother. \u201cI will pay you for your help.\u201d So the woman took her baby home and nursed him.", "10": "Later, when the boy was older, his mother brought him back to Pharaoh's daughter, who adopted him as her own son. The princess named him Moses,[a] for she explained, \u201cI lifted him out of the water.\u201d", "11": "Many years later, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit, he saw an Egyptian beating one of his fellow Hebrews.", "12": "After looking in all directions to make sure no one was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the body in the sand.", "13": "The next day, when Moses went out to visit his people again, he saw two Hebrew men fighting. \u201cWhy are you beating up your friend?\u201d Moses said to the one who had started the fight.", "14": "The man replied, \u201cWho appointed you to be our prince and judge? Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?\u201d Then Moses was afraid, thinking, \u201cEveryone knows what I did.\u201d", "15": "And sure enough, Pharaoh heard what had happened, and he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian. When Moses arrived in Midian, he sat down beside a well.", "16": "Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters who came as usual to draw water and fill the water troughs for their father's flocks.", "17": "But some other shepherds came and chased them away. So Moses jumped up and rescued the girls from the shepherds. Then he drew water for their flocks.", "18": "When the girls returned to Reuel, their father, he asked, \u201cWhy are you back so soon today?\u201d", "19": "\u201cAn Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,\u201d they answered. \u201cAnd then he drew water for us and watered our flocks.\u201d", "20": "\u201cThen where is he?\u201d their father asked. \u201cWhy did you leave him there? Invite him to come and eat with us.\u201d", "21": "Moses accepted the invitation, and he settled there with him. In time, Reuel gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to be his wife.", "22": "Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom,[b] for he explained, \u201cI have been a foreigner in a foreign land.\u201d", "23": "Years passed, and the king of Egypt died. But the Israelites continued to groan under their burden of slavery. They cried out for help, and their cry rose up to God.", "24": "God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.", "25": "He looked down on the people of Israel and knew it was time to act.[c]"}

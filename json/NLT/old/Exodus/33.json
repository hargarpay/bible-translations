{"1": "The Lord said to Moses, \u201cGet going, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt. Go up to the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I told them, 'I will give this land to your descendants.'", "2": "And I will send an angel before you to drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.", "3": "Go up to this land that flows with milk and honey. But I will not travel among you, for you are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I did, I would surely destroy you along the way.\u201d", "4": "When the people heard these stern words, they went into mourning and stopped wearing their jewelry and fine clothes.", "5": "For the Lord had told Moses to tell them, \u201cYou are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I were to travel with you for even a moment, I would destroy you. Remove your jewelry and fine clothes while I decide what to do with you.\u201d", "6": "So from the time they left Mount Sinai,[a] the Israelites wore no more jewelry or fine clothes.", "7": "It was Moses' practice to take the Tent of Meeting[b] and set it up some distance from the camp. Everyone who wanted to make a request of the Lord would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp.", "8": "Whenever Moses went out to the Tent of Meeting, all the people would get up and stand in the entrances of their own tents. They would all watch Moses until he disappeared inside.", "9": "As he went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at its entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses.", "10": "When the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents.", "11": "Inside the Tent of Meeting, the Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Afterward Moses would return to the camp, but the young man who assisted him, Joshua son of Nun, would remain behind in the Tent of Meeting.", "12": "One day Moses said to the Lord, \u201cYou have been telling me, 'Take these people up to the Promised Land.' But you haven't told me whom you will send with me. You have told me, 'I know you by name, and I look favorably on you.'", "13": "If it is true that you look favorably on me, let me know your ways so I may understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favor. And remember that this nation is your very own people.\u201d", "14": "The Lord replied, \u201cI will personally go with you, Moses, and I will give you rest\u2014everything will be fine for you.\u201d", "15": "Then Moses said, \u201cIf you don't personally go with us, don't make us leave this place.", "16": "How will anyone know that you look favorably on me\u2014on me and on your people\u2014if you don't go with us? For your presence among us sets your people and me apart from all other people on the earth.\u201d", "17": "The Lord replied to Moses, \u201cI will indeed do what you have asked, for I look favorably on you, and I know you by name.\u201d", "18": "Moses responded, \u201cThen show me your glorious presence.\u201d", "19": "The Lord replied, \u201cI will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will call out my name, Yahweh,[c] before you. For I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.", "20": "But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live.\u201d", "21": "The Lord continued, \u201cLook, stand near me on this rock.", "22": "As my glorious presence passes by, I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.", "23": "Then I will remove my hand and let you see me from behind. But my face will not be seen.\u201d"}

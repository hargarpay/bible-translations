{"1": "When Ahab got home, he told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including the way he had killed all the prophets of Baal.", "2": "So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah: \u201cMay the gods strike me and even kill me if by this time tomorrow I have not killed you just as you killed them.\u201d", "3": "Elijah was afraid and fled for his life. He went to Beersheba, a town in Judah, and he left his servant there.", "4": "Then he went on alone into the wilderness, traveling all day. He sat down under a solitary broom tree and prayed that he might die. \u201cI have had enough, Lord,\u201d he said. \u201cTake my life, for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died.\u201d", "5": "Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree. But as he was sleeping, an angel touched him and told him, \u201cGet up and eat!\u201d", "6": "He looked around and there beside his head was some bread baked on hot stones and a jar of water! So he ate and drank and lay down again.", "7": "Then the angel of the Lord came again and touched him and said, \u201cGet up and eat some more, or the journey ahead will be too much for you.\u201d", "8": "So he got up and ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai,[a] the mountain of God.", "9": "There he came to a cave, where he spent the night. But the Lord said to him, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Elijah?\u201d", "10": "Elijah replied, \u201cI have zealously served the Lord God Almighty. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed every one of your prophets. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.\u201d", "11": "\u201cGo out and stand before me on the mountain,\u201d the Lord told him. And as Elijah stood there, the Lord passed by, and a mighty windstorm hit the mountain. It was such a terrible blast that the rocks were torn loose, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.", "12": "And after the earthquake there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire there was the sound of a gentle whisper.", "13": "When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And a voice said, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Elijah?\u201d", "14": "He replied again, \u201cI have zealously served the Lord God Almighty. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed every one of your prophets. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.\u201d", "15": "Then the Lord told him, \u201cGo back the same way you came, and travel to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive there, anoint Hazael to be king of Aram.", "16": "Then anoint Jehu grandson of Nimshi[b] to be king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from the town of Abel-meholah to replace you as my prophet.", "17": "Anyone who escapes from Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and those who escape Jehu will be killed by Elisha!", "18": "Yet I will preserve 7,000 others in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed him!\u201d", "19": "So Elijah went and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing a field. There were twelve teams of oxen in the field, and Elisha was plowing with the twelfth team. Elijah went over to him and threw his cloak across his shoulders and then walked away.", "20": "Elisha left the oxen standing there, ran after Elijah, and said to him, \u201cFirst let me go and kiss my father and mother good-bye, and then I will go with you!\u201d Elijah replied, \u201cGo on back, but think about what I have done to you.\u201d", "21": "So Elisha returned to his oxen and slaughtered them. He used the wood from the plow to build a fire to roast their flesh. He passed around the meat to the townspeople, and they all ate. Then he went with Elijah as his assistant."}

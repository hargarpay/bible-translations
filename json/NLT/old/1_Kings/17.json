I have instructed a widow there to feed you.\u201d", "10": "So he went to Zarephath. As he arrived at the gates of the village, he saw a widow gathering sticks, and he asked her, \u201cWould you please bring me a little water in a cup?\u201d", "11": "As she was going to get it, he called to her, \u201cBring me a bite of bread, too.\u201d", "12": "But she said, \u201cI swear by the Lord your God that I don't have a single piece of bread in the house.

Then I will tell you whatever he reveals to me.\u201d So Balaam went alone to the top of a bare hill,", "4": "and God met him there. Balaam said to him, \u201cI have prepared seven altars and have sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar.\u201d", "5": "The Lord gave Balaam a message for King Balak.

'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me! Come and announce Israel's doom.'", "8": "But how can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I condemn those whom the Lord has not condemned?", "9": "I see them from the cliff tops; I watch them from the hills. I see a people who live by themselves, set apart from other nations.", "10": "Who can count Jacob's descendants, as numerous as dust? Who can count even a fourth of Israel's people? Let me die like the righteous; let my life end like theirs.\u201d", "11": "Then King Balak demanded of Balaam, \u201cWhat have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies.

Then he said, \u201cGo back to Balak and give him my message.\u201d", "17": "So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab. \u201cWhat did the Lord say?\u201d Balak asked eagerly.", "18": "This was the message Balaam delivered: \u201cRise up, Balak, and listen! Hear me, son of Zippor.", "19": "God is not a man, so he does not lie. He is not human, so he does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act?

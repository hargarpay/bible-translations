They prophesied in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.", "2": "Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak[a] responded by starting again to rebuild the Temple of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them and helped them.", "3": "But Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River,[b] and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues soon arrived in Jerusalem and asked, \u201cWho gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?\u201d", "4": "They also asked for[c] the names of all the men working on the Temple.", "5": "But because their God was watching over them, the leaders of the Jews were not prevented from building until a report was sent to Darius and he returned his decision.", "6": "This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor, Shethar-bozenai, and the other officials of the province west of the Euphrates River sent to King Darius:", "7": "\u201cTo King Darius. Greetings.", "8": "\u201cThe king should know that we went to the construction site of the Temple of the great God in the province of Judah.

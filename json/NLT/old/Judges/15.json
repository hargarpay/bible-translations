{"1": "Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat as a present to his wife. He said, \u201cI'm going into my wife's room to sleep with her,\u201d but her father wouldn't let him in.", "2": "\u201cI truly thought you must hate her,\u201d her father explained, \u201cso I gave her in marriage to your best man. But look, her younger sister is even more beautiful than she is. Marry her instead.\u201d", "3": "Samson said, \u201cThis time I cannot be blamed for everything I am going to do to you Philistines.\u201d", "4": "Then he went out and caught 300 foxes. He tied their tails together in pairs, and he fastened a torch to each pair of tails.", "5": "Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the grain fields of the Philistines. He burned all their grain to the ground, including the sheaves and the uncut grain. He also destroyed their vineyards and olive groves.", "6": "\u201cWho did this?\u201d the Philistines demanded. \u201cSamson,\u201d was the reply, \u201cbecause his father-in-law from Timnah gave Samson's wife to be married to his best man.\u201d So the Philistines went and got the woman and her father and burned them to death.", "7": "\u201cBecause you did this,\u201d Samson vowed, \u201cI won't rest until I take my revenge on you!\u201d", "8": "So he attacked the Philistines with great fury and killed many of them. Then he went to live in a cave in the rock of Etam.", "9": "The Philistines retaliated by setting up camp in Judah and spreading out near the town of Lehi.", "10": "The men of Judah asked the Philistines, \u201cWhy are you attacking us?\u201d The Philistines replied, \u201cWe've come to capture Samson. We've come to pay him back for what he did to us.\u201d", "11": "So 3,000 men of Judah went down to get Samson at the cave in the rock of Etam. They said to Samson, \u201cDon't you realize the Philistines rule over us? What are you doing to us?\u201d But Samson replied, \u201cI only did to them what they did to me.\u201d", "12": "But the men of Judah told him, \u201cWe have come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d Samson said. \u201cBut promise that you won't kill me yourselves.\u201d", "13": "\u201cWe will only tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines,\u201d they replied. \u201cWe won't kill you.\u201d So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.", "14": "As Samson arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came shouting in triumph. But the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Samson, and he snapped the ropes on his arms as if they were burnt strands of flax, and they fell from his wrists.", "15": "Then he found the jawbone of a recently killed donkey. He picked it up and killed 1,000 Philistines with it.", "16": "Then Samson said, \u201cWith the jawbone of a donkey, I've piled them in heaps! With the jawbone of a donkey, I've killed a thousand men!\u201d", "17": "When he finished his boasting, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was named Jawbone Hill.[a]", "18": "Samson was now very thirsty, and he cried out to the Lord, \u201cYou have accomplished this great victory by the strength of your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of these pagans?\u201d", "19": "So God caused water to gush out of a hollow in the ground at Lehi, and Samson was revived as he drank. Then he named that place \u201cThe Spring of the One Who Cried Out,\u201d[b] and it is still in Lehi to this day.", "20": "Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the period when the Philistines dominated the land."}

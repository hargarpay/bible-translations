Satan answered the Lord, \u201cI have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that's going on.\u201d", "3": "Then the Lord asked Satan, \u201cHave you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless\u2014a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though you urged me to harm him without cause.\u201d", "4": "Satan replied to the Lord, \u201cSkin for skin!

May it be so.\u201d", "6": "Then the Lord said, \u201cBroadcast this message in the streets of Jerusalem. Go from town to town throughout the land and say, 'Remember the ancient covenant, and do everything it requires.", "7": "For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, \u201cObey me!\u201d I have repeated this warning over and over to this day,", "8": "but your ancestors did not listen or even pay attention. Instead, they stubbornly followed their own evil desires.

Though they beg for mercy, I will not listen to their cries.", "12": "Then the people of Judah and Jerusalem will pray to their idols and burn incense before them. But the idols will not save them when disaster strikes!", "13": "Look now, people of Judah; you have as many gods as you have towns. You have as many altars of shame\u2014altars for burning incense to your god Baal\u2014as there are streets in Jerusalem.", "14": "\u201cPray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, for I will not listen to them when they cry out to me in distress.", "15": "\u201cWhat right do my beloved people have to come to my Temple, when they have done so many immoral things?

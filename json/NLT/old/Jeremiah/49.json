Then Israel will take back the land you took from her,\u201d says the Lord.", "3": "\u201cCry out, O Heshbon, for the town of Ai is destroyed. Weep, O people of Rabbah! Put on your clothes of mourning. Weep and wail, hiding in the hedges, for your god Molech, with his priests and officials, will be hauled off to distant lands.", "4": "You are proud of your fertile valleys, but they will soon be ruined.

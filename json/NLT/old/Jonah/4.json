That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people.", "3": "Just kill me now, Lord! I'd rather be dead than alive if what I predicted will not happen.\u201d", "4": "The Lord replied, \u201cIs it right for you to be angry about this?\u201d", "5": "Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under as he waited to see what would happen to the city.", "6": "And the Lord God arranged for a leafy plant to grow there, and soon it spread its broad leaves over Jonah's head, shading him from the sun.

It came quickly and died quickly.", "11": "But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness,[a] not to mention all the animals. Shouldn't I feel sorry for such a great city?\u201d"}

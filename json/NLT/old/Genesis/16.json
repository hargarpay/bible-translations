{"1": "Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not been able to bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.", "2": "So Sarai said to Abram, \u201cThe Lord has prevented me from having children. Go and sleep with my servant. Perhaps I can have children through her.\u201d And Abram agreed with Sarai's proposal.", "3": "So Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. (This happened ten years after Abram had settled in the land of Canaan.)", "4": "So Abram had sexual relations with Hagar, and she became pregnant. But when Hagar knew she was pregnant, she began to treat her mistress, Sarai, with contempt.", "5": "Then Sarai said to Abram, \u201cThis is all your fault! I put my servant into your arms, but now that she's pregnant she treats me with contempt. The Lord will show who's wrong\u2014you or me!\u201d", "6": "Abram replied, \u201cLook, she is your servant, so deal with her as you see fit.\u201d Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away.", "7": "The angel of the Lord found Hagar beside a spring of water in the wilderness, along the road to Shur.", "8": "The angel said to her, \u201cHagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from, and where are you going?\u201d \u201cI'm running away from my mistress, Sarai,\u201d she replied.", "9": "The angel of the Lord said to her, \u201cReturn to your mistress, and submit to her authority.\u201d", "10": "Then he added, \u201cI will give you more descendants than you can count.\u201d", "11": "And the angel also said, \u201cYou are now pregnant and will give birth to a son. You are to name him Ishmael (which means 'God hears'), for the Lord has heard your cry of distress.", "12": "This son of yours will be a wild man, as untamed as a wild donkey! He will raise his fist against everyone, and everyone will be against him. Yes, he will live in open hostility against all his relatives.\u201d", "13": "Thereafter, Hagar used another name to refer to the Lord, who had spoken to her.

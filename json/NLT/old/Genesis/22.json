{"1": "Some time later, God tested Abraham's faith. \u201cAbraham!\u201d God called. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cHere I am.\u201d", "2": "\u201cTake your son, your only son\u2014yes, Isaac, whom you love so much\u2014and go to the land of Moriah. Go and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.\u201d", "3": "The next morning Abraham got up early. He saddled his donkey and took two of his servants with him, along with his son, Isaac. Then he chopped wood for a fire for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had told him about.", "4": "On the third day of their journey, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.", "5": "\u201cStay here with the donkey,\u201d Abraham told the servants. \u201cThe boy and I will travel a little farther. We will worship there, and then we will come right back.\u201d", "6": "So Abraham placed the wood for the burnt offering on Isaac's shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them walked on together,", "7": "Isaac turned to Abraham and said, \u201cFather?\u201d \u201cYes, my son?\u201d Abraham replied. \u201cWe have the fire and the wood,\u201d the boy said, \u201cbut where is the sheep for the burnt offering?\u201d", "8": "\u201cGod will provide a sheep for the burnt offering, my son,\u201d Abraham answered. And they both walked on together.", "9": "When they arrived at the place where God had told him to go, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied his son, Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.", "10": "And Abraham picked up the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice.", "11": "At that moment the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, \u201cAbraham! Abraham!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Abraham replied. \u201cHere I am!\u201d", "12": "\u201cDon't lay a hand on the boy!\u201d the angel said. \u201cDo not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld from me even your son, your only son.\u201d", "13": "Then Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son.", "14": "Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means \u201cthe Lord will provide\u201d).

{"1": "When Jacob heard that grain was available in Egypt, he said to his sons, \u201cWhy are you standing around looking at one another?", "2": "I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy enough grain to keep us alive. Otherwise we'll die.\u201d", "3": "So Joseph's ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.", "4": "But Jacob wouldn't let Joseph's younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him.", "5": "So Jacob's[a] sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food, for the famine was in Canaan as well.", "6": "Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground.", "7": "Joseph recognized his brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d he demanded. \u201cFrom the land of Canaan,\u201d they replied. \u201cWe have come to buy food.\u201d", "8": "Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn't recognize him.", "9": "And he remembered the dreams he'd had about them many years before. He said to them, \u201cYou are spies! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.\u201d", "10": "\u201cNo, my lord!\u201d they exclaimed. \u201cYour servants have simply come to buy food.", "11": "We are all brothers\u2014members of the same family. We are honest men, sir! We are not spies!\u201d", "12": "\u201cYes, you are!\u201d Joseph insisted. \u201cYou have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.\u201d", "13": "\u201cSir,\u201d they said, \u201cthere are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us.\u201d", "14": "But Joseph insisted, \u201cAs I said, you are spies!", "15": "This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here!", "16": "One of you must go and get your brother. I'll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we'll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don't have a younger brother, then I'll know you are spies.\u201d", "17": "So Joseph put them all in prison for three days.", "18": "On the third day Joseph said to them, \u201cI am a God-fearing man. If you do as I say, you will live.", "19": "If you really are honest men, choose one of your brothers to remain in prison. The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families.", "20": "But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. This will prove that you are telling the truth, and you will not die.\u201d To this they agreed.", "21": "Speaking among themselves, they said, \u201cClearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago. We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life, but we wouldn't listen. That's why we're in this trouble.\u201d", "22": "\u201cDidn't I tell you not to sin against the boy?\u201d Reuben asked. \u201cBut you wouldn't listen. And now we have to answer for his blood!\u201d", "23": "Of course, they didn't know that Joseph understood them, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.", "24": "Now he turned away from them and began to weep. When he regained his composure, he spoke to them again. Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes.", "25": "Joseph then ordered his servants to fill the men's sacks with grain, but he also gave secret instructions to return each brother's payment at the top of his sack. He also gave them supplies for their journey home.", "26": "So the brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain and headed for home.", "27": "But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey, he found his money in the top of his sack.", "28": "\u201cLook!\u201d he exclaimed to his brothers. \u201cMy money has been returned; it's here in my sack!\u201d Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, \u201cWhat has God done to us?\u201d", "29": "When the brothers came to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them.", "30": "\u201cThe man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us,\u201d they told him. \u201cHe accused us of being spies scouting the land.", "31": "But we said, 'We are honest men, not spies.", "32": "We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One brother is no longer with us, and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan.'", "33": "\u201cThen the man who is governor of the land told us, 'This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take grain for your starving families and go on home.", "34": "But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. Then I will know you are honest men and not spies. Then I will give you back your brother, and you may trade freely in the land.'\u201d", "35": "As they emptied out their sacks, there in each man's sack was the bag of money he had paid for the grain! The brothers and their father were terrified when they saw the bags of money.", "36": "Jacob exclaimed, \u201cYou are robbing me of my children! Joseph is gone! Simeon is gone! And now you want to take Benjamin, too. Everything is going against me!\u201d", "37": "Then Reuben said to his father, \u201cYou may kill my two sons if I don't bring Benjamin back to you. I'll be responsible for him, and I promise to bring him back.\u201d", "38": "But Jacob replied, \u201cMy son will not go down with you. His brother Joseph is dead, and he is all I have left. If anything should happen to him on your journey, you would send this grieving, white-haired man to his grave.[b]\u201d"}

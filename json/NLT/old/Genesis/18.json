{"1": "The Lord appeared again to Abraham near the oak grove belonging to Mamre. One day Abraham was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the hottest part of the day.", "2": "He looked up and noticed three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran to meet them and welcomed them, bowing low to the ground.", "3": "\u201cMy lord,\u201d he said, \u201cif it pleases you, stop here for a while.", "4": "Rest in the shade of this tree while water is brought to wash your feet.", "5": "And since you've honored your servant with this visit, let me prepare some food to refresh you before you continue on your journey.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d they said. \u201cDo as you have said.\u201d", "6": "So Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah, \u201cHurry! Get three large measures[a] of your best flour, knead it into dough, and bake some bread.\u201d", "7": "Then Abraham ran out to the herd and chose a tender calf and gave it to his servant, who quickly prepared it.", "8": "When the food was ready, Abraham took some yogurt and milk and the roasted meat, and he served it to the men. As they ate, Abraham waited on them in the shade of the trees.", "9": "\u201cWhere is Sarah, your wife?\u201d the visitors asked. \u201cShe's inside the tent,\u201d Abraham replied.", "10": "Then one of them said, \u201cI will return to you about this time next year, and your wife, Sarah, will have a son!\u201d Sarah was listening to this conversation from the tent.", "11": "Abraham and Sarah were both very old by this time, and Sarah was long past the age of having children.", "12": "So she laughed silently to herself and said, \u201cHow could a worn-out woman like me enjoy such pleasure, especially when my master\u2014my husband\u2014is also so old?\u201d", "13": "Then the Lord said to Abraham, \u201cWhy did Sarah laugh? Why did she say, 'Can an old woman like me have a baby?'", "14": "Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d", "15": "Sarah was afraid, so she denied it, saying, \u201cI didn't laugh.\u201d But the Lord said, \u201cNo, you did laugh.\u201d", "16": "Then the men got up from their meal and looked out toward Sodom. As they left, Abraham went with them to send them on their way.", "17": "\u201cShould I hide my plan from Abraham?\u201d the Lord asked.", "18": "\u201cFor Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him.", "19": "I have singled him out so that he will direct his sons and their families to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just. Then I will do for Abraham all that I have promised.\u201d", "20": "So the Lord told Abraham, \u201cI have heard a great outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah, because their sin is so flagrant.", "21": "I am going down to see if their actions are as wicked as I have heard. If not, I want to know.\u201d", "22": "The other men turned and headed toward Sodom, but the Lord remained with Abraham.", "23": "Abraham approached him and said, \u201cWill you sweep away both the righteous and the wicked?", "24": "Suppose you find fifty righteous people living there in the city\u2014will you still sweep it away and not spare it for their sakes?", "25": "Surely you wouldn't do such a thing, destroying the righteous along with the wicked. Why, you would be treating the righteous and the wicked exactly the same! Surely you wouldn't do that! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?\u201d", "26": "And the Lord replied, \u201cIf I find fifty righteous people in Sodom, I will spare the entire city for their sake.\u201d", "27": "Then Abraham spoke again. \u201cSince I have begun, let me speak further to my Lord, even though I am but dust and ashes.", "28": "Suppose there are only forty-five righteous people rather than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cI will not destroy it if I find forty-five righteous people there.\u201d", "29": "Then Abraham pressed his request further. \u201cSuppose there are only forty?\u201d And the Lord replied, \u201cI will not destroy it for the sake of the forty.\u201d", "30": "\u201cPlease don't be angry, my Lord,\u201d Abraham pleaded. \u201cLet me speak\u2014suppose only thirty righteous people are found?\u201d And the Lord replied, \u201cI will not destroy it if I find thirty.\u201d", "31": "Then Abraham said, \u201cSince I have dared to speak to the Lord, let me continue\u2014suppose there are only twenty?\u201d And the Lord replied, \u201cThen I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.\u201d", "32": "Finally, Abraham said, \u201cLord, please don't be angry with me if I speak one more time. Suppose only ten are found there?\u201d And the Lord replied, \u201cThen I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.\u201d", "33": "When the Lord had finished his conversation with Abraham, he went on his way, and Abraham returned to his tent."}

{"1": "So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther's banquet.", "2": "On this second occasion, while they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, \u201cTell me what you want, Queen Esther. What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!\u201d", "3": "Queen Esther replied, \u201cIf I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request, I ask that my life and the lives of my people will be spared.", "4": "For my people and I have been sold to those who would kill, slaughter, and annihilate us. If we had merely been sold as slaves, I could remain quiet, for that would be too trivial a matter to warrant disturbing the king.\u201d", "5": "\u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d King Xerxes demanded. \u201cWho would be so presumptuous as to touch you?\u201d", "6": "Esther replied, \u201cThis wicked Haman is our adversary and our enemy.\u201d Haman grew pale with fright before the king and queen.", "7": "Then the king jumped to his feet in a rage and went out into the palace garden. Haman, however, stayed behind to plead for his life with Queen Esther, for he knew that the king intended to kill him.", "8": "In despair he fell on the couch where Queen Esther was reclining, just as the king was returning from the palace garden. The king exclaimed, \u201cWill he even assault the queen right here in the palace, before my very eyes?\u201d And as soon as the king spoke, his attendants covered Haman's face, signaling his doom.", "9": "Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, \u201cHaman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet[a] tall in his own courtyard. He intended to use it to impale Mordecai, the man who saved the king from assassination.\u201d \u201cThen impale Haman on it!\u201d the king ordered.", "10": "So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided."}

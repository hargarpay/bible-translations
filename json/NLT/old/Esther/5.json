So Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.", "3": "Then the king asked her, \u201cWhat do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!\u201d", "4": "And Esther replied, \u201cIf it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for the king.\u201d", "5": "The king turned to his attendants and said, \u201cTell Haman to come quickly to a banquet, as Esther has requested.\u201d So the king and Haman went to Esther's banquet.", "6": "And while they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, \u201cNow tell me what you really want.

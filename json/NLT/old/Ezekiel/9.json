{"1": "Then the Lord thundered, \u201cBring on the men appointed to punish the city! Tell them to bring their weapons with them!\u201d", "2": "Six men soon appeared from the upper gate that faces north, each carrying a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man dressed in linen, who carried a writer's case at his side. They all went into the Temple courtyard and stood beside the bronze altar.", "3": "Then the glory of the God of Israel rose up from between the cherubim, where it had rested, and moved to the entrance of the Temple. And the Lord called to the man dressed in linen who was carrying the writer's case.", "4": "He said to him, \u201cWalk through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of all who weep and sigh because of the detestable sins being committed in their city.\u201d", "5": "Then I heard the Lord say to the other men, \u201cFollow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity!", "6": "Kill them all\u2014old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin right here at the Temple.\u201d So they began by killing the seventy leaders.", "7": "\u201cDefile the Temple!\u201d the Lord commanded. \u201cFill its courtyards with corpses. Go!\u201d So they went and began killing throughout the city.", "8": "While they were out killing, I was all alone. I fell face down on the ground and cried out, \u201cO Sovereign Lord! Will your fury against Jerusalem wipe out everyone left in Israel?\u201d", "9": "Then he said to me, \u201cThe sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very, very great. The entire land is full of murder; the city is filled with injustice. They are saying, 'The Lord doesn't see it! The Lord has abandoned the land!'", "10": "So I will not spare them or have any pity on them. I will fully repay them for all they have done.\u201d", "11": "Then the man in linen clothing, who carried the writer's case, reported back and said, \u201cI have done as you commanded.\u201d"}

", "6": "Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. ", "7": "And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' ", "8": "But I said, 'No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' ", "9": "But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not call common.'

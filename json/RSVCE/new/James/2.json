{"1": "My brethren, show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. ", "2": "For if a man with gold rings and in fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, ", "3": "and you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, \u201cHave a seat here, please,\u201d while you say to the poor man, \u201cStand there,\u201d or, \u201cSit at my feet,\u201d ", "4": "have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? ", "5": "Listen, my beloved brethren. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him? ", "6": "But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you, is it not they who drag you into court? ", "7": "Is it not they who blaspheme that honorable name by which you are called?[a]", "8": "If you really fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself,\u201d you do well. ", "9": "But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. ", "10": "For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.[b] ", "11": "For he who said, \u201cDo not commit adultery,\u201d said also, \u201cDo not kill.\u201d If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.

Can his faith save him?[c] ", "15": "If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, ", "16": "and one of you says to them, \u201cGo in peace, be warmed and filled,\u201d without giving them the things needed for the body, what does it profit? ", "17": "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.", "18": "But some one will say, \u201cYou have faith and I have works.\u201d Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.

", "21": "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar? ", "22": "You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by works, ", "23": "and the scripture was fulfilled which says, \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness\u201d; and he was called the friend of God.

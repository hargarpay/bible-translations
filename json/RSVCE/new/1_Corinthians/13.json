{"1": "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. ", "2": "And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. ", "3": "If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned,[a] but have not love, I gain nothing.", "4": "Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; ", "5": "it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; ", "6": "it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. ", "7": "Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.", "8": "Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. ", "9": "For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; ", "10": "but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. ", "11": "When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways. ", "12": "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. ", "13": "So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love."}

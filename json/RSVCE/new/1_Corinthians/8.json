But some, through being hitherto accustomed to idols, eat food as really offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. ", "8": "Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. ", "9": "Only take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.

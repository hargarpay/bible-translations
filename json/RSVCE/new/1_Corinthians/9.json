", "2": "If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.", "3": "This is my defense to those who would examine me.[a] ", "4": "Do we not have the right to our food and drink? ", "5": "Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a wife,[b][c] as the other apostles and the brethren[d] of the Lord and Cephas?

For I would rather die than have any one deprive me of my ground for boasting. ", "16": "For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! ", "17": "For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. ", "18": "What then is my reward?

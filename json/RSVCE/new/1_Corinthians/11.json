{"1": "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.", "2": "I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I have delivered them to you. ", "3": "But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. ", "4": "Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, ", "5": "but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head\u2014it is the same as if her head were shaven. ", "6": "For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil. ", "7": "For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. ", "8": "(For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. ", "9": "Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.) ", "10": "That is why a woman ought to have a veil[a] on her head, because of the angels.

", "18": "For, in the first place, when you assemble as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it, ", "19": "for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. ", "20": "When you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.[b] ", "21": "For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk. ", "22": "What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.", "23": "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, ", "24": "and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, \u201cThis is my body which is for[c] you.

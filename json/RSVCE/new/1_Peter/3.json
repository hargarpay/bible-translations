", "3": "Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of hair, decoration of gold, and wearing of robes, ", "4": "but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. ", "5": "So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and were submissive to their husbands, ", "6": "as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.", "7": "Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.", "8": "Finally, all of you, have unity of spirit, sympathy, love of the brethren, a tender heart and a humble mind. ", "9": "Do not return evil for evil or reviling for reviling; but on the contrary bless, for to this you have been called, that you may obtain a blessing.

", "17": "For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong.

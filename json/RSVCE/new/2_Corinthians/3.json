", "2": "You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on your[a] hearts, to be known and read by all men; ", "3": "and you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.", "4": "Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. ", "5": "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our sufficiency is from God, ", "6": "who has qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, not in a written code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life.", "7": "Now if the dispensation of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such splendor that the Israelites could not look at Moses' face because of its brightness, fading as this was, ", "8": "will not the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater splendor?

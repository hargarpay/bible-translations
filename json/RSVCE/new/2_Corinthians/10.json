{"1": "I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ\u2014I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold to you when I am away![a]\u2014 ", "2": "I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of acting in worldly fashion. ", "3": "For though we live in the world we are not carrying on a worldly war, ", "4": "for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds. ", "5": "We destroy arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, ", "6": "being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.", "7": "Look at what is before your eyes. If any one is confident that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that as he is Christ's, so are we. ", "8": "For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame.

", "15": "We do not boast beyond limit, in other men's labors; but our hope is that as your faith increases, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, ", "16": "so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another's field. ", "17": "\u201cLet him who boasts, boast of the Lord.\u201d ", "18": "For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord commends."}

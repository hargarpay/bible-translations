So they went. ", "5": "Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. ", "6": "And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' ", "7": "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' ", "8": "And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' ", "9": "And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.

", "13": "But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?

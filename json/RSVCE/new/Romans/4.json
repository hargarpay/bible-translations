{"1": "What then shall we say about[a] Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? ", "2": "For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. ", "3": "For what does the scripture say? \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\u201d ", "4": "Now to one who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due. ", "5": "And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. ", "6": "So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:", "7": "\u201cBlessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;", "8": "blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin.\u201d", "9": "Is this blessing pronounced only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? We say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. ", "10": "How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. ", "11": "He received circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them, ", "12": "and likewise the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.", "13": "The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that they should inherit the world, did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. ", "14": "If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.

", "22": "That is why his faith was \u201creckoned to him as righteousness.\u201d ", "23": "But the words, \u201cit was reckoned to him,\u201d were written not for his sake alone, ", "24": "but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, ", "25": "who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification."}

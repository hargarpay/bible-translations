", "3": "For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen by race. ", "4": "They are Israelites, and to them belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; ", "5": "to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed for ever.[a] Amen.", "6": "But it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, ", "7": "and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but \u201cThrough Isaac shall your descendants be named.\u201d ", "8": "This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants.

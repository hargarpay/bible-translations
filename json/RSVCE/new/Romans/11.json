{"1": "I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. ", "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Eli\u2032jah, how he pleads with God against Israel? ", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed thy prophets, they have demolished thy altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.\u201d ", "4": "But what is God's reply to him? \u201cI have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Ba\u2032al.\u201d ", "5": "So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. ", "6": "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.", "7": "What then? Israel failed to obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, ", "8": "as it is written, \u201cGod gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day.\u201d", "9": "And David says, \u201cLet their feast become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a retribution for them;", "10": "let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs for ever.\u201d", "11": "So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. ", "12": "Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!", "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry ", "14": "in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. ", "15": "For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? ", "16": "If the dough offered as first fruits is holy, so is the whole lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.", "17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness[a] of the olive tree, ", "18": "do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you. ", "19": "You will say, \u201cBranches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u201d ", "20": "That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. ", "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. ", "22": "Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off. ", "23": "And even the others, if they do not persist in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. ", "24": "For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.", "25": "Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brethren: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles come in, ", "26": "and so all Israel will be saved; as it is written, \u201cThe Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob\u201d;", "27": "\u201cand this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\u201d", "28": "As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. ", "29": "For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. ", "30": "Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, ", "31": "so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may[b] receive mercy. ", "32": "For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.", "33": "O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!", "34": "\u201cFor who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?\u201d", "35": "\u201cOr who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?\u201d", "36": "For from him and through him and to him are all things.

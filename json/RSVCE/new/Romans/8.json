{"1": "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. ", "2": "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. ", "3": "For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin,[a] he condemned sin in the flesh, ", "4": "in order that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. ", "5": "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. ", "6": "To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. ", "7": "For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, indeed it cannot; ", "8": "and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.", "9": "But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God really dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. ", "10": "But if Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive because of righteousness. ", "11": "If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.", "12": "So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh\u2014 ", "13": "for if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. ", "14": "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. ", "15": "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship. When we cry, \u201cAbba! Father!\u201d ", "16": "it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, ", "17": "and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.", "18": "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. ", "19": "For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God;[b] ", "20": "for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope; ", "21": "because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God. ", "22": "We know that the whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now; ", "23": "and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. ", "24": "For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? ", "25": "But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.", "26": "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. ", "27": "And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because[c] the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.", "28": "We know that in everything God works for good[d] with those who love him,[e] who are called according to his purpose. ", "29": "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. ", "30": "And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.", "31": "What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us? ", "32": "He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, will he not also give us all things with him? ", "33": "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; ", "34": "who is to condemn? Is it Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us?[f] ", "35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ", "36": "As it is written, \u201cFor thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.\u201d", "37": "No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. ", "38": "For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, ", "39": "nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."}

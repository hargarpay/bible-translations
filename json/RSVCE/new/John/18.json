", "3": "So Judas, procuring a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. ", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward and said to them, \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d ", "5": "They answered him, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cI am he.\u201d Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.

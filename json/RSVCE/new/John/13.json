", "2": "And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, ", "3": "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, ", "4": "rose from supper, laid aside his garments, and girded himself with a towel. ", "5": "Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. ", "6": "He came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him, \u201cLord, do you wash my feet?\u201d ", "7": "Jesus answered him, \u201cWhat I am doing you do not know now, but afterward you will understand.\u201d ", "8": "Peter said to him, \u201cYou shall never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cIf I do not wash you, you have no part in me.\u201d ", "9": "Simon Peter said to him, \u201cLord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!\u201d ", "10": "Jesus said to him, \u201cHe who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet,[b] but he is clean all over; and you are clean, but not all of you.\u201d ", "11": "For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, \u201cYou are not all clean.\u201d", "12": "When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and resumed his place, he said to them, \u201cDo you know what I have done to you? ", "13": "You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am. ", "14": "If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.

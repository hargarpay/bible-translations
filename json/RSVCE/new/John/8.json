", "5": "Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?\u201d ", "6": "This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. ", "7": "And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, \u201cLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ", "8": "And once more he bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.

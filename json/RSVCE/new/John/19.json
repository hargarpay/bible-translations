{"1": "Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. ", "2": "And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe; ", "3": "they came up to him, saying, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d and struck him with their hands. ", "4": "Pilate went out again, and said to them, \u201cBehold, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.\u201d ", "5": "So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, \u201cHere is the man!\u201d ", "6": "When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, \u201cCrucify him, crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them, \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.\u201d ", "7": "The Jews answered him, \u201cWe have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made himself the Son of God.\u201d[a] ", "8": "When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid; ", "9": "he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d[b] But Jesus gave no answer. ", "10": "Pilate therefore said to him, \u201cYou will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?\u201d ", "11": "Jesus answered him, \u201cYou would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\u201d", "12": "Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, \u201cIf you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.\u201d ", "13": "When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gab\u2032batha. ", "14": "Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, \u201cHere is your King!\u201d ", "15": "They cried out, \u201cAway with him, away with him, crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them, \u201cShall I crucify your King?\u201d The chief priests answered, \u201cWe have no king but Caesar.\u201d ", "16": "Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.", "17": "So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Gol\u2032gotha. ", "18": "There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. ", "19": "Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, \u201cJesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\u201d ", "20": "Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. ", "21": "The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, \u201cDo not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.'\u201d ", "22": "Pilate answered, \u201cWhat I have written I have written.\u201d", "23": "When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; ", "24": "so they said to one another, \u201cLet us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.\u201d This was to fulfil the scripture, \u201cThey parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.\u201d", "25": "So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Mag\u2032dalene. ", "26": "When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, \u201cWoman, behold, your son!\u201d ", "27": "Then he said to the disciple, \u201cBehold, your mother!\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.[c]", "28": "After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), \u201cI thirst.\u201d ", "29": "A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. ", "30": "When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, \u201cIt is finished\u201d; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.", "31": "Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. ", "32": "So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; ", "33": "but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. ", "34": "But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.

", "36": "For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u201cNot a bone of him shall be broken.\u201d ", "37": "And again another scripture says, \u201cThey shall look on him whom they have pierced.\u201d", "38": "After this Joseph of Arimathe\u2032a, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took away his body. ", "39": "Nicode\u2032mus also, who had at first come to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight. ", "40": "They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. ", "41": "Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid. ", "42": "So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there."}

{"1": "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any of you be judged to have failed to reach it. ", "2": "For good news came to us just as to them; but the message which they heard did not benefit them, because it did not meet with faith in the hearers.[a] ", "3": "For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, \u201cAs I swore in my wrath, 'They shall never enter my rest,'\u201d although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. ", "4": "For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way, \u201cAnd God rested on the seventh day from all his works.\u201d ", "5": "And again in this place he said, \u201cThey shall never enter my rest.\u201d", "6": "Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, ", "7": "again he sets a certain day, \u201cToday,\u201d saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, \u201cToday, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.\u201d", "8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, God[b] would not speak later of another day.

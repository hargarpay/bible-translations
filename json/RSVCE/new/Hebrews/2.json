{"1": "Therefore we must pay the closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. ", "2": "For if the message declared by angels[a] was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, ", "3": "how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, ", "4": "while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.", "5": "For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. ", "6": "It has been testified somewhere, \u201cWhat is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that thou carest for him?", "7": "Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honor,[b]", "8": "putting everything in subjection under his feet.\u201d Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.

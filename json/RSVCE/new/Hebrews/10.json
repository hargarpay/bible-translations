If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sin. ", "3": "But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year. ", "4": "For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.", "5": "Consequently, when Christ[b] came into the world, he said, \u201cSacrifices and offerings thou hast not desired, but a body hast thou prepared for me;", "6": "in burnt offerings and sin offerings thou hast taken no pleasure.", "7": "Then I said, 'Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God,' as it is written of me in the roll of the book.\u201d", "8": "When he said above, \u201cThou hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings\u201d (these are offered according to the law), ", "9": "then he added, \u201cLo, I have come to do thy will.\u201d He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.

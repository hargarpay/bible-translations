", "2": "And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: ", "3": "\u201cListen! A sower went out to sow. ", "4": "And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. ", "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; ", "6": "and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. ", "7": "Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. ", "8": "And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\u201d ", "9": "And he said, \u201cHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.\u201d", "10": "And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables. ", "11": "And he said to them, \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables; ", "12": "so that[a] they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.\u201d ", "13": "And he said to them, \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? ", "14": "The sower sows the word. ", "15": "And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them.

{"1": "And Bo\u2032az went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the next of kin, of whom Bo\u2032az had spoken, came by. So Bo\u2032az said, \u201cTurn aside, friend; sit down here\u201d; and he turned aside and sat down. ", "2": "And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, \u201cSit down here\u201d; so they sat down. ", "3": "Then he said to the next of kin, \u201cNa\u2032omi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land which belonged to our kinsman Elim\u2032elech. ", "4": "So I thought I would tell you of it, and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.\u201d And he said, \u201cI will redeem it.\u201d ", "5": "Then Bo\u2032az said, \u201cThe day you buy the field from the hand of Na\u2032omi, you are also buying Ruth[a] the Moabitess, the widow of the dead, in order to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance.\u201d ", "6": "Then the next of kin said, \u201cI cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.\u201d", "7": "Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel. ", "8": "So when the next of kin said to Bo\u2032az, \u201cBuy it for yourself,\u201d he drew off his sandal. ", "9": "Then Bo\u2032az said to the elders and all the people, \u201cYou are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Na\u2032omi all that belonged to Elim\u2032elech and all that belonged to Chil\u2032ion and to Mahlon. ", "10": "Also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his native place; you are witnesses this day.\u201d ", "11": "Then all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, \u201cWe are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you prosper in Eph\u2032rathah and be renowned in Bethlehem; ", "12": "and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the children that the Lord will give you by this young woman.\u201d", "13": "So Bo\u2032az took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.

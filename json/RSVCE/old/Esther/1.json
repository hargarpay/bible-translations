{"1": "[a]2\u00a0In the second year of the reign of Ahasu-e\u2032rus[b] the Great, on the first day of Nisan, Mor\u2032decai the son of Ja\u2032ir, son of Shim\u2032e-i, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream. 3\u00a0He was a Jew, dwelling in the city of Susa, a great man, serving in the court of the king. 4\u00a0He was one of the captives whom Nebuchadnez\u2032zar king of Babylon had brought from Jerusalem with Jeconi\u2032ah king of Judea. And this was his dream: Behold, noise[c] and confusion, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth! 6\u00a0And behold, two great dragons came forward, both ready to fight, and they roared terribly. 7\u00a0And at their roaring every nation prepared for war, to fight against the nation of the righteous. 8\u00a0And behold, a day of darkness and gloom, tribulation and distress, affliction and great tumult upon the earth! 9\u00a0And the whole righteous nation was troubled; they feared the evils that threatened them, and were ready to perish. 10\u00a0Then they cried to God; and from their cry, as though from a tiny spring, there came a great river, with abundant water; 11\u00a0light came, and the sun rose, and the lowly were exalted and consumed those held in honor. Mor\u2032decai saw in this dream what God had determined to do, and after he awoke he had it on his mind and sought all day to understand it in every detail. Now Mor\u2032decai took his rest in the courtyard with Gab\u2032atha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king who kept watch in the courtyard. 2\u00a0He overheard their conversation and inquired into their purposes, and learned that they were preparing to lay hands upon Ahasu-e\u2032rus[d] the king; and he informed the king concerning them. 3\u00a0Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and when they confessed they were led to execution. 4\u00a0The king made a permanent record of these things, and Mor\u2032decai wrote an account of them. 5\u00a0And the king ordered Mor\u2032decai to serve in the court and rewarded him for these things. 6\u00a0But Haman, the son of Hammeda\u2032tha, a Bougae\u2032an, was in great honor with the king, and he sought to injure Mor\u2032decai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king. In the days of Ahasu-e\u2032rus, the Ahasu-e\u2032rus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, ", "2": "in those days when King Ahasu-e\u2032rus sat on his royal throne in Susa the capital, ", "3": "in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and servants, the army chiefs[e] of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces being before him, ", "4": "while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his majesty for many days, a hundred and eighty days. ", "5": "And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa the capital, both great and small, a banquet lasting for seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace. ", "6": "There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings caught up with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings[f] and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones. ", "7": "Drinks were served in golden goblets, goblets of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king. ", "8": "And drinking was according to the law, no one was compelled; for the king had given orders to all the officials of his palace to do as every man desired. ", "9": "Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasu-e\u2032rus.", "10": "On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehu\u2032man, Biztha, Harbo\u2032na, Bigtha and Abag\u2032tha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served King Ahasu-e\u2032rus as chamberlains, ", "11": "to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to behold. ", "12": "But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command conveyed by the eunuchs. At this the king was enraged, and his anger burned within him.", "13": "Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times\u2014for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment, ", "14": "the men next to him being Carshe\u2032na, Shethar, Adma\u2032tha, Tarshish, Meres, Marse\u2032na, and Memu\u2032can, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom\u2014: ", "15": "\u201cAccording to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasu-e\u2032rus conveyed by the eunuchs?\u201d ", "16": "Then Memu\u2032can said in presence of the king and the princes, \u201cNot only to the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also to all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasu-e\u2032rus. ", "17": "For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt upon their husbands, since they will say, 'King Ahasu-e\u2032rus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.' ", "18": "This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will be telling it to all the king's princes, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty. ", "19": "If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is to come no more before King Ahasu-e\u2032rus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.

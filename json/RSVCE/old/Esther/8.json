{"1": "On that day King Ahasu-e\u2032rus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mor\u2032decai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her; ", "2": "and the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mor\u2032decai. And Esther set Mor\u2032decai over the house of Haman.", "3": "Then Esther spoke again to the king; she fell at his feet and besought him with tears to avert the evil design of Haman the Ag\u2032agite and the plot which he had devised against the Jews. ", "4": "And the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, ", "5": "and Esther rose and stood before the king. And she said, \u201cIf it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Ag\u2032agite, the son of Hammeda\u2032tha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king. ", "6": "For how can I endure to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?\u201d ", "7": "Then King Ahasu-e\u2032rus said to Queen Esther and to Mor\u2032decai the Jew, \u201cBehold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he would lay hands on the Jews. ", "8": "And you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king's ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked.\u201d", "9": "The king's secretaries were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and an edict was written according to all that Mor\u2032decai commanded concerning the Jews to the satraps and the governors and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language. ", "10": "The writing was in the name of King Ahasu-e\u2032rus and sealed with the king's ring, and letters were sent by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud. ", "11": "By these the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, with their children and women, and to plunder their goods, ", "12": "upon one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasu-e\u2032rus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. The following is a copy of this letter: \u201cThe Great King, Ahasu-e\u2032rus,[a] to the rulers of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, and to those who are loyal to our government, greeting. \u201cThe more often they are honored by the too great kindness of their benefactors, the more proud do many men become. 3\u00a0They not only seek to injure our subjects, but in their inability to stand prosperity they even undertake to scheme against their own benefactors. 4\u00a0They not only take away thankfulness from among men, but, carried away by the boasts of those who know nothing of goodness, they suppose that they will escape the evil-hating justice of God, who always sees everything. 5\u00a0And often many of those who are set in places of authority have been made in part responsible for the shedding of innocent blood, and have been involved in irremediable calamities, by the persuasion of friends who have been entrusted with the administration of public affairs, 6\u00a0when these men by the false trickery of their evil natures beguile the sincere good will of their sovereigns. \u201cWhat has been wickedly accomplished through the pestilent behavior of those who exercise authority unworthily, can be seen not so much from the more ancient records which we hand on as from investigation of matters close at hand. 8\u00a0For the future we will take care to render our kingdom quiet and peaceable for all men, 9\u00a0by changing our methods and always judging what comes before our eyes with more equitable consideration. 10\u00a0For Haman, the son of Hammeda\u2032tha, a Macedo\u2032nian (really an alien to the Persian blood, and quite devoid of our kindliness), having become our guest, 11\u00a0so far enjoyed the good will that we have for every nation that he was called our father and was continually bowed down to by all as the person second to the royal throne. 12\u00a0But, unable to restrain his arrogance, he undertook to deprive us of our kingdom and our life, 13\u00a0and with intricate craft and deceit asked for the destruction of Mor\u2032decai, our savior and perpetual benefactor, and of Esther, the blameless partner of our kingdom, together with their whole nation. 14\u00a0He thought that in this way he would find us undefended and would transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedo\u2032nians. \u201cBut we find that the Jews, who were consigned to annihilation by this thrice accursed man, are not evildoers but are governed by most righteous laws 16\u00a0and are sons of the Most High, the most mighty living God, who has directed the kingdom both for us and for our fathers in the most excellent order. \u201cYou will therefore do well not to put in execution the letters sent by Haman the son of Hammeda\u2032tha, 18\u00a0because the man himself who did these things has been hanged at the gate of Susa, with all his household. For God, who rules over all things, has speedily inflicted on him the punishment he deserved. \u201cTherefore post a copy of this letter publicly in every place, and permit the Jews to live under their own laws. 20\u00a0And give them reinforcements, so that on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, on that very day they may defend themselves against those who attack them at the time of their affliction. 21\u00a0For God, who rules over all things, has made this day to be a joy to his chosen people instead of a day of destruction for them. \u201cTherefore you shall observe this with all good cheer as a notable day among your commemorative festivals, 23\u00a0so that both now and hereafter it may mean salvation for us and the loyal Persians, but that for those who plot against us it may be a reminder of destruction. \u201cEvery city and country, without exception, which does not act accordingly, shall be destroyed in wrath with spear and fire. It shall be made not only impassable for men, but also most hateful for all time to beasts and birds.\u201d", "13": "A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, and by proclamation to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to avenge themselves upon their enemies. 14\u00a0So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out in haste, urged by the king's command; and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. Then Mor\u2032decai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a mantle of fine linen and purple, while the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. 16\u00a0The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor. 17\u00a0And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them."}

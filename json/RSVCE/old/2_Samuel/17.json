{"1": "Moreover Ahith\u2032ophel said to Ab\u2032salom, \u201cLet me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue David tonight. ", "2": "I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged, and throw him into a panic; and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down the king only, ", "3": "and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man,[a] and all the people will be at peace.\u201d ", "4": "And the advice pleased Ab\u2032salom and all the elders of Israel.", "5": "Then Ab\u2032salom said, \u201cCall Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.\u201d ", "6": "And when Hushai came to Ab\u2032salom, Ab\u2032salom said to him, \u201cThus has Ahith\u2032ophel spoken; shall we do as he advises? If not, you speak.\u201d ", "7": "Then Hushai said to Ab\u2032salom, \u201cThis time the counsel which Ahith\u2032ophel has given is not good.\u201d ", "8": "Hushai said moreover, \u201cYou know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people. ", "9": "Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits, or in some other place. And when some of the people fall[b] at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Ab\u2032salom.'

", "11": "But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. ", "12": "So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and all the men with him not one will be left. ", "13": "If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there.\u201d ", "14": "And Ab\u2032salom and all the men of Israel said, \u201cThe counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahith\u2032ophel.\u201d For the Lord had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahith\u2032ophel, so that the Lord might bring evil upon Ab\u2032salom.", "15": "Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abi\u2032athar the priests, \u201cThus and so did Ahith\u2032ophel counsel Ab\u2032salom and the elders of Israel; and thus and so have I counseled.

", "20": "When Ab\u2032salom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, \u201cWhere are Ahim\u2032a-az and Jonathan?\u201d And the woman said to them, \u201cThey have gone over the brook[c] of water.\u201d And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.", "21": "After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, \u201cArise, and go quickly over the water; for thus and so has Ahith\u2032ophel counseled against you.\u201d ", "22": "Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan; by daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.", "23": "When Ahith\u2032ophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and went off home to his own city. And he set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.", "24": "Then David came to Mahana\u2032im. And Ab\u2032salom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. ", "25": "Now Ab\u2032salom had set Ama\u2032sa over the army instead of Jo\u2032ab.

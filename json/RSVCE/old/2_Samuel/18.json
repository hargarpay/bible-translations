And the king said to the men, \u201cI myself will also go out with you.\u201d ", "3": "But the men said, \u201cYou shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us;[a] therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.\u201d ", "4": "The king said to them, \u201cWhatever seems best to you I will do.\u201d So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.

{"1": "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God, and turned away from evil. ", "2": "There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. ", "3": "He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east. ", "4": "His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each on his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. ", "5": "And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, \u201cIt may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.\u201d Thus Job did continually.", "6": "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[a] also came among them. ", "7": "The Lord said to Satan, \u201cWhence have you come?\u201d Satan answered the Lord, \u201cFrom going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.\u201d ", "8": "And the Lord said to Satan, \u201cHave you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?\u201d ", "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, \u201cDoes Job fear God for nought? ", "10": "Hast thou not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. ", "11": "But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy face.\u201d ", "12": "And the Lord said to Satan, \u201cBehold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself do not put forth your hand.\u201d So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.", "13": "Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; ", "14": "and there came a messenger to Job, and said, \u201cThe oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them; ", "15": "and the Sabe\u2032ans fell upon them and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.\u201d ", "16": "While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, \u201cThe fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you.\u201d ", "17": "While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, \u201cThe Chalde\u2032ans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.\u201d ", "18": "While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, \u201cYour sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; ", "19": "and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you.\u201d", "20": "Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped.

{"1": "Now when it was reported to Sanbal\u2032lat and Tobi\u2032ah and to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), ", "2": "Sanbal\u2032lat and Geshem sent to me, saying, \u201cCome and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.\u201d But they intended to do me harm. ", "3": "And I sent messengers to them, saying, \u201cI am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?\u201d ", "4": "And they sent to me four times in this way and I answered them in the same manner. ", "5": "In the same way Sanbal\u2032lat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand. ", "6": "In it was written, \u201cIt is reported among the nations, and Geshem[a] also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall; and you wish to become their king, according to this report. ", "7": "And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, 'There is a king in Judah.' And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So now come, and let us take counsel together.\u201d ", "8": "Then I sent to him, saying, \u201cNo such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind.\u201d ", "9": "For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, \u201cTheir hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.\u201d But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.", "10": "Now when I went into the house of Shemai\u2032ah the son of Delai\u2032ah, son of Mehet\u2032abel, who was shut up, he said, \u201cLet us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you, at night they are coming to kill you.\u201d ", "11": "But I said, \u201cShould such a man as I flee? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live?[b] I will not go in.\u201d ", "12": "And I understood, and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobi\u2032ah and Sanbal\u2032lat had hired him. ", "13": "For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me an evil name, in order to taunt me. ", "14": "Remember Tobi\u2032ah and Sanbal\u2032lat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess No-adi\u2032ah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.", "15": "So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days. ", "16": "And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us were afraid[c] and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God. ", "17": "Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobi\u2032ah, and Tobi\u2032ah's letters came to them. ", "18": "For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecani\u2032ah the son of Arah: and his son Jeho-ha\u2032nan had taken the daughter of Meshul\u2032lam the son of Berechi\u2032ah as his wife. ", "19": "Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words to him. And Tobi\u2032ah sent letters to make me afraid."}

{"1": "Now a man from the house of Levi went and took to wife a daughter of Levi. ", "2": "The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. ", "3": "And when she could hide him no longer she took for him a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with bitumen and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds at the river's brink. ", "4": "And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him. ", "5": "Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked beside the river; she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to fetch it. ", "6": "When she opened it she saw the child; and lo, the babe was crying. She took pity on him and said, \u201cThis is one of the Hebrews' children.\u201d ", "7": "Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, \u201cShall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?\u201d ", "8": "And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \u201cGo.\u201d So the girl went and called the child's mother. ", "9": "And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \u201cTake this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.\u201d So the woman took the child and nursed him. ", "10": "And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son; and she named him Moses,[a] for she said, \u201cBecause I drew him out[b] of the water.\u201d", "11": "One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people. ", "12": "He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. ", "13": "When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together; and he said to the man that did the wrong, \u201cWhy do you strike your fellow?\u201d ", "14": "He answered, \u201cWho made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\u201d Then Moses was afraid, and thought, \u201cSurely the thing is known.\u201d ", "15": "When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh, and stayed in the land of Mid\u2032ian; and he sat down by a well.

Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.\u201d ", "21": "And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daugher Zippo\u2032rah.

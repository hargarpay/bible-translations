I do not know the Lord, and moreover I will not let Israel go.\u201d ", "3": "Then they said, \u201cThe God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go, we pray, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.\u201d ", "4": "But the king of Egypt said to them, \u201cMoses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get to your burdens.\u201d ", "5": "And Pharaoh said, \u201cBehold, the people of the land are now many and you make them rest from their burdens!\u201d ", "6": "The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, ", "7": "\u201cYou shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.

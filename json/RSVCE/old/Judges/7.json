", "3": "Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.'\u201d And Gideon tested them;[a] twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.", "4": "And the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cThe people are still too many; take them down to the water and I will test them for you there; and he of whom I say to you, 'This man shall go with you,' shall go with you; and any of whom I say to you, 'This man shall not go with you,' shall not go.\u201d ", "5": "So he brought the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cEvery one that laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself; likewise every one that kneels down to drink.\u201d ", "6": "And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. ", "7": "And the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cWith the three hundred men that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Mid\u2032ianites into your hand; and let all the others go every man to his home.\u201d ", "8": "So he took the jars of the people from their hands,[b] and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Mid\u2032ian was below him in the valley.", "9": "That same night the Lord said to him, \u201cArise, go down against the camp; for I have given it into your hand. ", "10": "But if you fear to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant; ", "11": "and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.\u201d Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp. ", "12": "And the Mid\u2032ianites and the Amal\u2032ekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for multitude.

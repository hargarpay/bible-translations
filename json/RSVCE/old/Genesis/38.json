{"1": "It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adul\u2032lamite, whose name was Hirah. ", "2": "There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; he married her and went in to her, ", "3": "and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. ", "4": "Again she conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. ", "5": "Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. She[a] was in Chezib when she bore him. ", "6": "And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar. ", "7": "But Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him. ", "8": "Then Judah said to Onan, \u201cGo in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.\u201d ", "9": "But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife he spilled the semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother. ", "10": "And what he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord, and he slew him also. ", "11": "Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, \u201cRemain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up\u201d\u2014for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.", "12": "In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died; and when Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

", "15": "When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face. ", "16": "He went over to her at the road side, and said, \u201cCome, let me come in to you,\u201d for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, \u201cWhat will you give me, that you may come in to me?\u201d ", "17": "He answered, \u201cI will send you a kid from the flock.\u201d And she said, \u201cWill you give me a pledge, till you send it?\u201d ", "18": "He said, \u201cWhat pledge shall I give you?\u201d She replied, \u201cYour signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.\u201d So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him. ", "19": "Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.", "20": "When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he could not find her.

", "28": "And when she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, \u201cThis came out first.\u201d ", "29": "But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out; and she said, \u201cWhat a breach you have made for yourself!\u201d Therefore his name was called Perez.[e] ", "30": "Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah."}

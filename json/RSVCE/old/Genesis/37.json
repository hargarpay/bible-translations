{"1": "Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. ", "2": "This is the history of the family of Jacob. [a]Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father. ", "3": "Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves. ", "4": "But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.", "5": "Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more. ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cHear this dream which I have dreamed: ", "7": "behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf.\u201d ", "8": "His brothers said to him, \u201cAre you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?\u201d So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words. ", "9": "Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, \u201cBehold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.\u201d ", "10": "But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, \u201cWhat is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?\u201d ", "11": "And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.", "12": "Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem. ", "13": "And Israel said to Joseph, \u201cAre not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.\u201d And he said to him, \u201cHere I am.\u201d ", "14": "So he said to him, \u201cGo now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again.\u201d So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. ", "15": "And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, \u201cWhat are you seeking?\u201d ", "16": "\u201cI am seeking my brothers,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock.\u201d ", "17": "And the man said, \u201cThey have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'\u201d So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan. ", "18": "They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. ", "19": "They said to one another, \u201cHere comes this dreamer. ", "20": "Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.\u201d ", "21": "But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, \u201cLet us not take his life.\u201d ", "22": "And Reuben said to them, \u201cShed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him\u201d\u2014that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. ", "23": "So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore; ", "24": "and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it.", "25": "Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ish\u2032maelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. ", "26": "Then Judah said to his brothers, \u201cWhat profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? ", "27": "Come, let us sell him to the Ish\u2032maelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.\u201d And his brothers heeded him. ", "28": "Then Mid\u2032ianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ish\u2032maelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.", "29": "When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes ", "30": "and returned to his brothers, and said, \u201cThe lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?\u201d ", "31": "Then they took Joseph's robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood; ", "32": "and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, \u201cThis we have found; see now whether it is your son's robe or not.\u201d ", "33": "And he recognized it, and said, \u201cIt is my son's robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.\u201d ", "34": "Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. ", "35": "All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, \u201cNo, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.\u201d Thus his father wept for him. ", "36": "Meanwhile the Mid\u2032ianites had sold him in Egypt to Pot\u2032i-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard."}

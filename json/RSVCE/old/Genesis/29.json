{"1": "Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the people of the east. ", "2": "As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and lo, three flocks of sheep lying beside it; for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large, ", "3": "and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place upon the mouth of the well.", "4": "Jacob said to them, \u201cMy brothers, where do you come from?\u201d They said, \u201cWe are from Haran.\u201d ", "5": "He said to them, \u201cDo you know Laban the son of Nahor?\u201d They said, \u201cWe know him.\u201d ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cIs it well with him?\u201d They said, \u201cIt is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!\u201d ", "7": "He said, \u201cBehold, it is still high day, it is not time for the animals to be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, pasture them.\u201d ", "8": "But they said, \u201cWe cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.\u201d", "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them. ", "10": "Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

Jacob told Laban all these things, ", "14": "and Laban said to him, \u201cSurely you are my bone and my flesh!\u201d And he stayed with him a month.", "15": "Then Laban said to Jacob, \u201cBecause you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?\u201d ", "16": "Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

", "25": "And in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and Jacob said to Laban, \u201cWhat is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?\u201d ", "26": "Laban said, \u201cIt is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.

", "34": "Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, \u201cNow this time my husband will be joined[c] to me, because I have borne him three sons\u201d; therefore his name was called Levi. ", "35": "And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, \u201cThis time I will praise[d] the Lord\u201d; therefore she called his name Judah; then she ceased bearing."}

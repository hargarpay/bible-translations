", "2": "And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. ", "3": "So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation.", "4": "These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. [a]In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, ", "5": "when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up\u2014for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; ", "6": "but a mist[b] went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground\u2014 ", "7": "then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. ", "8": "And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed. ", "9": "And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.", "10": "A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. ", "11": "The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Hav\u2032ilah, where there is gold; ", "12": "and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.

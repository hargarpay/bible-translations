{"1": "Rejoice not, O Israel! Exult not[a] like the peoples; for you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved a harlot's hire upon all threshing floors.", "2": "Threshing floor and winevat shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail them.", "3": "They shall not remain in the land of the Lord; but E\u2032phraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.", "4": "They shall not pour libations of wine to the Lord; and they shall not please him with their sacrifices. Their bread[b] shall be like mourners' bread; all who eat of it shall be defiled; for their bread shall be for their hunger only; it shall not come to the house of the Lord.", "5": "What will you do on the day of appointed festival, and on the day of the feast of the Lord?", "6": "For behold, they are going to Assyria;[c] Egypt shall gather them, Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver; thorns shall be in their tents.", "7": "The days of punishment have come, the days of recompense have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad, because of your great iniquity and great hatred.", "8": "The prophet is the watchman of E\u2032phraim, the people of my God, yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.", "9": "They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gib\u2032e-ah: he will remember their iniquity, he will punish their sins.", "10": "Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruit on the fig tree, in its first season, I saw your fathers. But they came to Ba\u2032al-pe\u2032or, and consecrated themselves to Ba\u2032al,[d] and became detestable like the thing they loved.", "11": "E\u2032phraim's glory shall fly away like a bird\u2014 no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!", "12": "Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them till none is left. Woe to them when I depart from them!", "13": "E\u2032phraim's sons, as I have seen, are destined for a prey;[e] E\u2032phraim must lead forth his sons to slaughter.", "14": "Give them, O Lord\u2014 what wilt thou give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.", "15": "Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal; there I began to hate them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their princes are rebels.", "16": "E\u2032phraim is stricken, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit. Even though they bring forth, I will slay their beloved children.", "17": "My God will cast them off, because they have not hearkened to him; they shall be wanderers among the nations."}

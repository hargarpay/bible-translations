Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was put away.", "2": "Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water, and die of thirst.", "3": "I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering.\u201d", "4": "The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with a word him that is weary. Morning by morning he wakens, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.", "5": "The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I turned not backward.", "6": "I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.", "7": "For the Lord God helps me; therefore I have not been confounded; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame;", "8": "he who vindicates me is near.

This shall you have from my hand: you shall lie down in torment."}

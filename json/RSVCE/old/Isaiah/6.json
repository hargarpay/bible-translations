{"1": "[a]In the year that King Uzzi\u2032ah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. ", "2": "Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. ", "3": "And one called to another and said: \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.\u201d", "4": "And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. ", "5": "And I said: \u201cWoe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!\u201d", "6": "Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs from the altar. ", "7": "And he touched my mouth, and said: \u201cBehold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin forgiven.\u201d ", "8": "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?\u201d Then I said, \u201cHere am I! Send me.\u201d ", "9": "And he said, \u201cGo, and say to this people: 'Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and see, but do not perceive.'", "10": "Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.\u201d", "11": "Then I said, \u201cHow long, O Lord?\u201d And he said: \u201cUntil cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the land is utterly desolate,", "12": "and the Lord removes men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.", "13": "And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains standing when it is felled.\u201d The holy seed is its stump."}

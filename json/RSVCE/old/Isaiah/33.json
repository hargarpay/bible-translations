When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of dealing treacherously, you will be dealt with treacherously.", "2": "O Lord, be gracious to us; we wait for thee. Be our arm every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.", "3": "At the thunderous noise peoples flee, at the lifting up of thyself nations are scattered;", "4": "and spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap, men leap upon it.", "5": "The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high; he will fill Zion with justice and righteousness;", "6": "and he will be the stability of your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is his treasure.", "7": "Behold, the valiant ones[a] cry without; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.", "8": "The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases. Covenants are broken, witnesses[b] are despised, there is no regard for man.", "9": "The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.", "10": "\u201cNow I will arise,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cnow I will lift myself up; now I will be exalted.", "11": "You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.", "12": "And the peoples will be as if burned to lime, like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.\u201d", "13": "Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.", "14": "The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: \u201cWho among us can dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?\u201d", "15": "He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands, lest they hold a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil,", "16": "he will dwell on the heights; his place of defense will be the fortresses of rocks; his bread will be given him, his water will be sure.", "17": "Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will behold a land that stretches afar.", "18": "Your mind will muse on the terror: \u201cWhere is he who counted, where is he who weighed the tribute? Where is he who counted the towers?\u201d", "19": "You will see no more the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech which you cannot comprehend, stammering in a tongue which you cannot understand.", "20": "Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken.", "21": "But there the Lord in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor stately ship can pass.", "22": "For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our ruler, the Lord is our king; he will save us.", "23": "Your tackle hangs loose; it cannot hold the mast firm in its place, or keep the sail spread out. Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; even the lame will take the prey.", "24": "And no inhabitant will say, \u201cI am sick\u201d; the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity."}

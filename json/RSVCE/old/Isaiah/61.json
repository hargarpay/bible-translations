{"1": "[a]The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted;[b] he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison[c] to those who are bound;", "2": "to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;", "3": "to grant to those who mourn in Zion\u2014 to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.", "4": "They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.", "5": "Aliens shall stand and feed your flocks, foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;", "6": "but you shall be called the priests of the Lord, men shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their riches you shall glory.", "7": "Instead of your shame you shall have a double portion, instead of dishonor you[d] shall rejoice in your[e] lot; therefore in your[f] land you[g] shall possess a double portion; yours[h] shall be everlasting joy.", "8": "For I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery and wrong;[i] I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.", "9": "Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are a people whom the Lord has blessed.", "10": "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.", "11": "For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations."}

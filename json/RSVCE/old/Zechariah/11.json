Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled!", "3": "Hark, the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is despoiled! Hark, the roar of the lions, for the jungle of the Jordan is laid waste!", "4": "Thus said the Lord my God: \u201cBecome shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter. ", "5": "Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished; and those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the Lord, I have become rich'; and their own shepherds have no pity on them. ", "6": "For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, says the Lord. Lo, I will cause men to fall each into the hand of his shepherd, and each into the hand of his king; and they shall crush the earth, and I will deliver none from their hand.\u201d", "7": "So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slain for those who trafficked in the sheep. And I took two staffs; one I named Grace, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep. ", "8": "In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. ", "9": "So I said, \u201cI will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die; what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let those that are left devour the flesh of one another.\u201d ", "10": "And I took my staff Grace, and I broke it, annulling the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. ", "11": "So it was annulled on that day, and the traffickers in the sheep, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the Lord. ", "12": "Then I said to them, \u201cIf it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.\u201d And they weighed out as my wages thirty shekels of silver. ", "13": "Then the Lord said to me, \u201cCast it into the treasury\u201d[a]\u2014the lordly price at which I was paid off by them. So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury[b] in the house of the Lord. ", "14": "Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.", "15": "Then the Lord said to me, \u201cTake once more the implements of a worthless shepherd. ", "16": "For lo, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for the perishing, or seek the wandering,[c] or heal the maimed, or nourish the sound, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.", "17": "Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword smite his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be wholly withered, his right eye utterly blinded!\u201d"}

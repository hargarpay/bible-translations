", "2": "For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the passover in the second month\u2014 ", "3": "for they could not keep it in its time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem\u2014 ", "4": "and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly. ", "5": "So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to the Lord the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed. ", "6": "So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, \u201cO people of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. ", "7": "Do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who were faithless to the Lord God of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as you see. ", "8": "Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the Lord, and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever, and serve the Lord your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you. ", "9": "For if you return to the Lord, your brethren and your children will find compassion with their captors, and return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.\u201d", "10": "So the couriers went from city to city through the country of E\u2032phraim and Manas\u2032seh, and as far as Zeb\u2032ulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. ", "11": "Only a few men of Asher, of Manas\u2032seh, and of Zeb\u2032ulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. ", "12": "The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the Lord.", "13": "And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.

", "15": "And they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were put to shame, so that they sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of the Lord. ", "16": "They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites. ", "17": "For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to kill the passover lamb for every one who was not clean, to make it holy to the Lord. ", "18": "For a multitude of the people, many of them from E\u2032phraim, Manas\u2032seh, Is\u2032sachar, and Zeb\u2032ulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed.

", "22": "And Hezeki\u2032ah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the Lord. So the people ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the Lord the God of their fathers.", "23": "Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness. ", "24": "For Hezeki\u2032ah king of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And the priests sanctified themselves in great numbers. ", "25": "The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. ", "26": "So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. ", "27": "Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven."}

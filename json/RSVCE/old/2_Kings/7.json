", "4": "If we say, 'Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians; if they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.\u201d ", "5": "So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; but when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there. ", "6": "For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots, and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, \u201cBehold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us.\u201d ", "7": "So they fled away in the twilight and forsook their tents, their horses, and their asses, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.

This day is a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.\u201d ", "10": "So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, \u201cWe came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.\u201d ", "11": "Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's household. ", "12": "And the king rose in the night, and said to his servants, \u201cI will tell you what the Syrians have prepared against us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.'\u201d ", "13": "And one of his servants said, \u201cLet some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel that have already perished; let us send and see.\u201d ", "14": "So they took two mounted men, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, \u201cGo and see.\u201d ", "15": "So they went after them as far as the Jordan; and lo, all the way was littered with garments and equipment which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste.

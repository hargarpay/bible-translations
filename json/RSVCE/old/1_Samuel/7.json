", "2": "From the day that the ark was lodged at Kir\u2032iath-je\u2032arim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.[a]", "3": "Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, \u201cIf you are returning to the Lord with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ash\u2032taroth from among you, and direct your heart to the Lord, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.\u201d ", "4": "So Israel put away the Ba\u2032als and the Ash\u2032taroth, and they served the Lord only.", "5": "Then Samuel said, \u201cGather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lord for you.\u201d ", "6": "So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, \u201cWe have sinned against the Lord.\u201d And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.

", "2": "And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father's house. ", "3": "Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. ", "4": "And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his girdle.

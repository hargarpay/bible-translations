", "4": "Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the loins. ", "5": "Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. ", "6": "And he said to me, \u201cSon of man, have you seen this?\u201d Then he led me back along the bank of the river.

", "11": "But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. ", "12": "And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.\u201d", "13": "Thus says the Lord God: \u201cThese are the boundaries by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel.

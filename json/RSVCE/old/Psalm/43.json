{"1": "Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people; from deceitful and unjust men deliver me!", "2": "For thou art the God in whom I take refuge; why hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?", "3": "Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to thy holy hill and to thy dwelling!", "4": "Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; and I will praise thee with the lyre, O God, my God.", "5": "Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God."}

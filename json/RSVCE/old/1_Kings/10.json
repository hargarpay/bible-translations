{"1": "Now when the queen of Sheba[a] heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions. ", "2": "She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind. ", "3": "And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king which he could not explain to her. ", "4": "And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, ", "5": "the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.", "6": "And she said to the king, \u201cThe report was true which I heard in my own land of your affairs and of your wisdom, ", "7": "but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it; and behold, the half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report which I heard. ", "8": "Happy are your wives![b] Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! ", "9": "Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the Lord loved Israel for ever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness.\u201d ", "10": "Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones; never again came such an abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.", "11": "Moreover the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones. ", "12": "And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the Lord, and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers; no such almug wood has come or been seen, to this day.", "13": "And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land, with her servants.", "14": "Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, ", "15": "besides that which came from the traders and from the traffic of the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and from the governors of the land. ", "16": "King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. ", "17": "And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. ", "18": "The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest gold. ", "19": "The throne had six steps, and at the back of the throne was a calf's head, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests, ", "20": "while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom. ", "21": "All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver, it was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. ", "22": "For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish[c] used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.[d]", "23": "Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. ", "24": "And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. ", "25": "Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.", "26": "And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. ", "27": "And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephe\u2032lah. ", "28": "And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Ku\u2032e, and the king's traders received them from Ku\u2032e at a price. ", "29": "A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria."}

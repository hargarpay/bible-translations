First, Melchizedek's name means \u201cking of \u00b7goodness [righteousness; justice],\u201d and he is king of Salem [C\u202fanother name for Jerusalem], which means \u201cking of peace.\u201d ", "3": "\u00b7No one knows who Melchizedek's father or mother was [L\u202f\u2026without father, without mother], \u00b7where he came from [L\u202fwithout genealogy], \u00b7when he was born, or when he died [L\u202fhaving neither beginning of days, nor end of life; C\u202fsomething unstated was assumed not to exist]. Melchizedek is like the Son of God; he continues being a priest forever [C\u202fMelchizedek's unmentioned genealogy in Genesis is, by analogy, like Jesus' eternal Sonship and priesthood].", "4": "You can see how great Melchizedek was. Abraham, the \u00b7great father [patriarch], gave him a tenth of \u00b7everything that he won in battle [the spoils/booty/plunder].

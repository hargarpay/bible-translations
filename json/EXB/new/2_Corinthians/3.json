{"1": "Are we starting to \u00b7brag about [praise; commend] ourselves again? Do we need letters of \u00b7introduction [recommendation] to you or from you, like some other people [C\u202fPaul's opponents evidently carried letters of reference (perhaps from Jerusalem)]? ", "2": "You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone [C\u202fthe changed lives of the Corinthians prove Paul's credibility as an apostle of Jesus Christ]. ", "3": "You show that you are a letter from Christ \u00b7sent through us [delivered by us; or produced by us; the result of our ministry]. This letter is not written with ink but \u00b7with [by] the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on stone tablets [C\u202fthe law of Moses was written on stone tablets; Ex. 24:12; 32:16] but on human hearts [L\u202fhearts of flesh; Jer. 31:33; Ezek. 11:19; 36:26].", "4": "We can say this, because through Christ we \u00b7feel certain before God [have confidence in God's presence; or can trust in God]. ", "5": "We are not saying that we \u00b7can do this work ourselves [L\u202fare able/competent/adequate to consider anything as from ourselves]. \u00b7It is God who makes us able to do all that we do [L\u202fBut our ability/competence/adequacy is from God]. ", "6": "He made us \u00b7able [adequate; competent] to be servants of a new \u00b7agreement from himself to his people [covenant; Jer. 31:31\u201334; Luke 22:20]. This new \u00b7agreement [covenant] is not \u00b7a written law [L\u202fof the letter], but it is of the Spirit. The \u00b7written law [L\u202fletter] brings death, but the Spirit gives life.", "7": "The \u00b7law [or old system; L\u202fministry] that brought death was \u00b7written in words [L\u202fengraved with letters] on stone. It came with \u00b7God's glory [L\u202fglory], which made Moses' face so \u00b7bright [glorious] that the \u00b7Israelites [L\u202fchildren of Israel] could not \u00b7continue to look [gaze] at it. But that glory \u00b7later disappeared [was fading; or was made ineffective (by the veil on his face)]. ", "8": "So \u00b7surely [L\u202fwill not\u2026?] the \u00b7new way that brings [L\u202fministry of] the Spirit has even more glory. ", "9": "[L\u202fFor] If the \u00b7law that judged people guilty of sin [L\u202fministry of condemnation] had glory, surely the \u00b7new way that makes people right with God [L\u202fministry of righteousness] has much greater glory. ", "10": "For that which had glory [C\u202fthe law] \u00b7really loses its glory [L\u202fhas no glory] when it is compared to the much greater glory [C\u202fthe new way through the Spirit]. ", "11": "[L\u202fFor] If that which \u00b7disappeared [faded; was made ineffective; C\u202fthe law; v. 7] came with glory, then that which \u00b7continues forever [remains; abides; C\u202fthe new way through the Spirit] has much greater glory.", "12": "We have this hope, so we \u00b7are very bold [or speak with boldness/confidence]. ", "13": "We are not like Moses, who put a \u00b7covering [veil] over his face so the \u00b7Israelites [L\u202fchildren of Israel] would not see it [Ex. 34:29\u201335]. The glory was \u00b7disappearing [fading; or made ineffective], and Moses did not want them to see it end. ", "14": "But their minds were \u00b7closed [stubborn; hardened], and even today that same \u00b7covering [veil] \u00b7hides the meaning [L\u202fremains] when they read the old \u00b7agreement [covenant]. That covering is \u00b7taken away [L\u202fnot lifted, because it is removed] only through Christ. ", "15": "Even today, when they read \u00b7the law of Moses [L\u202fMoses], there is a \u00b7covering over [L\u202fveil laying upon] their \u00b7minds [hearts]. ", "16": "But when a person \u00b7changes and follows [L\u202fturns to] the Lord, that \u00b7covering [veil] is taken away [Ex. 34:34]. ", "17": "The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. ", "18": "\u00b7Our faces, then, are not covered [L\u202fWith an unveiled face\u2026]. We all \u00b7show [reflect; or behold; or contemplate] the Lord's glory, and we are being \u00b7changed [transformed] \u00b7to be like him [L\u202finto the same image]. This change in us \u00b7brings ever greater glory [or is from one degree of glory to another; L\u202fis from glory to glory], which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."}

{"1": "Dear brothers and sisters, when I came to you, I did not come preaching God's \u00b7secret[a] [mystery; C\u202fsomething God had not previously disclosed; Eph. 1:9] with \u00b7fancy [superior; eloquent] words or a show of human wisdom. ", "2": "[L\u202fFor] I \u00b7decided [resolved] that while I was with you I would \u00b7forget about everything [L\u202fnot know anything] except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross. ", "3": "So when I came to you, I was weak and fearful and trembling. ", "4": "My \u00b7teaching [message; speech] and preaching were not with words of human wisdom that \u00b7persuade [or entice] people but with \u00b7proof of the power that the Spirit gives [or proof powerfully revealed by the Spirit; or demonstrations of the Spirit and of power]. ", "5": "This was so that your faith would be in God's power and not in human wisdom.", "6": "However, we speak wisdom to those who are mature. But this wisdom is not from this \u00b7world [age] or from the rulers of this \u00b7world [age], who \u00b7are losing their power [will soon disappear; are passing away]. ", "7": "We speak God's \u00b7secret wisdom [or wisdom in a mystery; 2:1], which he has kept hidden. Before the \u00b7world began [ages], God \u00b7planned [decreed; destined] this wisdom for our glory. ", "8": "None of the rulers of this \u00b7world [age] understood it. If they had, they would not have crucified the \u00b7Lord of glory [glorious Lord]. ", "9": "But as it is written in the Scriptures: \u201cNo \u00b7one [L\u202feye] has ever seen this, and no \u00b7one [L\u202fear] has ever heard about it. No \u00b7one [L\u202fhuman heart] has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him [Is. 64:4].\u201d", "10": "But God has \u00b7shown [revealed to] us these things through the Spirit.

Only a person's spirit that lives within him knows his thoughts. It is the same with God. No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

Who has been able to \u00b7teach [advise; counsel] him [Is. 40:13]?\u201d But we have the mind of Christ [C\u202fthe Holy Spirit reveals God and his ways to us; Rom. 11:34]."}

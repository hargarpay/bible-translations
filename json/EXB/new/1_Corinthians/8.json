{"1": "Now \u00b7I will write about [or concerning your question about; L\u202fconcerning; see 7:1; 12:1; 16:1] meat that is sacrificed to idols. We know that \u201cwe all have knowledge [C\u202fprobably a slogan used by the Corinthians; see 6:12, 13; 7:1; 8:4; 10:23].\u201d Knowledge puffs you up with pride, but love builds up. ", "2": "If you think you know something, you do not yet know as \u00b7well as you should [L\u202fyou ought to know]. ", "3": "But if any person loves God, that person is known by God.", "4": "So \u00b7this is what I say about [L\u202fconcerning] eating meat sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is really nothing in the world, and we know there is \u00b7only one God [no God but one; Deut. 4:35, 39; C\u202fthese may be other slogans the church was using to justify their behavior; see v. 1].

All things were made through him, and we also \u00b7were made [exist; live] through him.", "7": "But not all people know this. Some people are still so used to idols that when they eat meat, they still think of it as being sacrificed to an idol. Because their conscience is weak, when they eat it, \u00b7they feel guilty [L\u202ftheir conscience is defiled]. ", "8": "But food will not \u00b7bring us closer [make us acceptable] to God. Refusing to eat does not make us \u00b7less pleasing to God [any worse; L\u202flacking], and eating does not make us \u00b7better in God's sight [any better; L\u202fabounding].", "9": "But be careful that \u00b7your freedom [this right/authority of yours] does not \u00b7cause those who are weak in faith to fall into sin [L\u202fbecome a stumbling block to the weak]. ", "10": "Suppose one of you who has knowledge eats in an idol's temple. Someone who \u00b7is weak in faith [or has a weak conscience] might see you eating there and be \u00b7encouraged [enboldened] to eat meat sacrificed to idols \u00b7while thinking it is wrong to do so [or as a result of his weak conscience]. ", "11": "This weak \u00b7believer [L\u202fbrother] for whom Christ died is \u00b7ruined [destroyed] because of your \u201cknowledge.\u201d ", "12": "When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ like this and \u00b7cause them to do what they feel is wrong [L\u202fwound their weak conscience], you are also sinning against Christ.

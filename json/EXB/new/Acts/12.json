", "2": "He ordered James, the brother of John, to be killed by the sword [C\u202fexecution by beheading]. ", "3": "Herod saw that \u00b7some of the people liked this [L\u202fthis pleased the Jews/Jewish leaders], so he decided to arrest Peter, too. (This happened during the time of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.)", "4": "After Herod \u00b7arrested [seized] Peter, he put him in \u00b7jail [prison] and handed him over to be guarded by \u00b7sixteen [L\u202ffour squads of four] soldiers. Herod planned to bring Peter \u00b7before the people for trial [L\u202fto the people; C\u202fan idiom for a public trial] after the Passover Feast.

Then the angel said, \u201c\u00b7Put on your coat [L\u202fWrap your coat/cloak around you] and follow me.\u201d ", "9": "So Peter followed him out, but he did not know if what the angel was doing was real; he thought he might be seeing a vision.

{"1": "It was decided that we would sail for Italy. An \u00b7officer [centurion] named Julius, who served in the \u00b7emperor's army [Imperial/Augustan regiment; C\u202fa military unit directly under Caesar], \u00b7guarded [took charge of] Paul and some other prisoners. ", "2": "We got on a ship that was from the city of Adramyttium [C\u202fa seaport on the northwest coast of Asia Minor] and was about to sail to different ports in Asia [C\u202fa Roman province, in present-day Turkey]. Aristarchus [19:29; 20:4; Col. 4:10; Philem. 24], a man from the city of Thessalonica [17:1] in Macedonia [16:9], went with us. ", "3": "The next day we \u00b7came to [landed at] Sidon [12:20]. Julius was very \u00b7good [kind; considerate] to Paul and gave him freedom to go visit his friends, who took care of his needs. ", "4": "We left Sidon and sailed \u00b7close to [to the north of; L\u202funder the lee/shelter of] the island of Cyprus [11:19], because the wind was blowing against us. ", "5": "We \u00b7went [L\u202fsailed] across the sea by Cilicia [6:9; 9:11] and Pamphylia [13:13] and landed at the city of Myra [C\u202fa significant city on the Andracus River] in Lycia [C\u202fa province in southeastern Asia Minor]. ", "6": "There the \u00b7officer [centurion] found a ship from Alexandria [C\u202fa major city in Egypt] that was going to Italy, so he put us on it.", "7": "We sailed slowly for many days. We had a hard time reaching Cnidus [C\u202fa port on the southwest side of Asia Minor] because the wind was blowing against us, and we could not go any farther. So we sailed \u00b7by the south side [L\u202funder the shelter/lee] of the island of Crete [C\u202fa large island off the southern coast of Asia Minor] near Salmone [C\u202fa promontory on the eastern coast of Crete, present-day Cape Sidero]. ", "8": "Sailing past it was hard.

So Paul \u00b7warned [advised] them, ", "10": "\u201cMen, I can see there will be \u00b7a lot of trouble [L\u202fdisaster and heavy loss] on this trip. The ship, the cargo, and even our lives may be lost.\u201d ", "11": "But the centurion was more persuaded by the \u00b7captain [pilot] and the owner of the ship than by what Paul said. ", "12": "Since that harbor was not a \u00b7good [suitable; safe] place for the ship to stay for the winter, \u00b7most of the men [the majority] decided that the ship \u00b7should leave [put to sea]. They hoped we could go to Phoenix and stay there for the winter. Phoenix, a \u00b7city [or port; or harbor] on the island of Crete, had a harbor which faced southwest and northwest.", "13": "When a \u00b7good [moderate; gentle] wind began to blow from the south, the men on the ship thought they \u00b7could reach their goal [or had achieved their objective; or had the opportunity they were waiting for]. So they pulled up the anchor, and we sailed very close to the island of Crete. ", "14": "But \u00b7then [L\u202fnot long after this] a \u00b7very strong [violent; hurricane-like] wind named the \u201cnortheaster\u201d came from \u00b7the island [L\u202fit]. ", "15": "The ship was caught in it and could not sail against it. So we stopped trying and \u00b7let the wind carry us [L\u202fwere driven along]. ", "16": "When we went \u00b7below [under the lee/shelter of] a small island named Cauda [C\u202f23 miles off the south coast of Crete], we were barely able to bring in the lifeboat. ", "17": "After the men took the lifeboat in, they tied \u00b7ropes [or cables] \u00b7around [or under] the ship to hold it together. The men were afraid that the ship would \u00b7hit [run aground on] the sandbanks of Syrtis [C\u202foff the coast of North Africa], so they lowered the \u00b7sail [or sea anchor; L\u202fgear] and let the wind carry the ship. ", "18": "The next day the storm was blowing us so hard that the men threw out some of the cargo. ", "19": "\u00b7A day later [L\u202fOn the third day] with their own hands they threw out the ship's \u00b7equipment [rigging; tackle; gear]. ", "20": "When we could not see the sun or the stars for many days, and \u00b7the storm was very bad [L\u202fno small storm raged], we lost all hope of being saved.", "21": "After \u00b7the men [many] had \u00b7gone without food [or lost their appetite] for a long time, Paul stood up before them and said, \u201cMen, you should have \u00b7listened to me [obeyed me; taken my advice]. You should not have sailed from Crete. Then you would not have all this trouble and loss. ", "22": "But now I \u00b7tell [urge; advise] you to \u00b7cheer up [keep up your courage] because none of you will \u00b7die [be lost]. Only the ship will be lost.

You must stand before Caesar. And God has \u00b7promised you that he will save the lives of [graciously granted safety to] everyone sailing with you.' ", "25": "So men, have courage. [L\u202fFor] I trust in God that everything will happen as \u00b7his angel told me [L\u202fI have been told].

About \u00b7midnight [L\u202fthe middle of the night] the sailors thought we were close to land, ", "28": "so they \u00b7lowered a rope with a weight on the end of it into the water [took a sounding]. They found that the water was one hundred twenty feet deep [L\u202ftwenty fathoms]. They went a little farther and \u00b7lowered the rope again [took a sounding]. It was ninety feet [L\u202ffifteen fathoms] deep. ", "29": "\u00b7The sailors [L\u202fThey] were afraid that we would \u00b7hit the rocks [run aground], so they threw four anchors \u00b7into the water [L\u202ffrom the stern] and prayed for daylight to come. ", "30": "Some of the sailors wanted to leave the ship, and they lowered the lifeboat, pretending they were throwing more anchors from the \u00b7front of the ship [bow]. ", "31": "But Paul told the \u00b7officer [centurion] and the other soldiers, \u201cIf these men do not stay in the ship, your lives cannot be saved.\u201d ", "32": "So the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water.", "33": "Just before dawn Paul \u00b7began persuading [begged; encouraged; urged] all the people to \u00b7eat something [L\u202ftake food]. He said, \u201c\u00b7For the past fourteen days [L\u202fToday is the fourteenth day] you have been \u00b7waiting and watching [in suspense] and \u00b7not eating [L\u202fgoing without food, taking nothing]. ", "34": "Now I \u00b7beg [urge; encourage] you to \u00b7eat something [L\u202ftake food]. You need it to \u00b7stay alive [survive]. None of you will lose even one hair off your heads.\u201d ", "35": "After he said this, Paul took some bread and thanked God for it before all of them. He broke off a piece and began eating [C\u202freflecting language associated with the Lord's Supper]. ", "36": "They all felt \u00b7better [encouraged] and \u00b7started eating [L\u202ftook bread], too. ", "37": "\u00b7There were [L\u202fWe were in all] two hundred seventy-six people on the ship. ", "38": "When they had eaten all they wanted, they began making the ship lighter by throwing the \u00b7grain [wheat] into the sea.", "39": "When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach and wanted to sail the ship \u00b7to [up on] the beach if they could. ", "40": "So they \u00b7cut the ropes to [L\u202fcast off] the anchors and left \u00b7the anchors [L\u202fthem] in the sea. At the same time, they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders. Then they raised the front sail into the wind and sailed toward the beach. ", "41": "But the ship hit a \u00b7sandbank [reef; shoal; or cross-current; L\u202fplace of two seas]. The front of the ship stuck there and could not move, but the \u00b7back of the ship [stern] began to break up from the big waves.", "42": "The soldiers \u00b7decided [made a decision] to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim away and escape.

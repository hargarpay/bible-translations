We stayed there for several days.", "13": "On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the river where we \u00b7thought [expected] we would find a special place for prayer [C\u202fPhilippi evidently had no synagogue because of its small Jewish population]. Some women had gathered there, so we sat down and talked with them.

{"1": "Paul looked [L\u202fintently] at the \u00b7council [Sanhedrin; 22:30] and said, \u201c[L\u202fMen,] Brothers, I have \u00b7lived my life [conducted myself; L\u202flived as a citizen] \u00b7without guilt feelings [L\u202fwith a good/clear conscience] before God up to this day.\u201d ", "2": "Ananias, the high priest [C\u202fhigh priest from ad 47 to 58; not the man named in 22:12], heard this and told the men who were standing near Paul to \u00b7hit [strike] him on the mouth.

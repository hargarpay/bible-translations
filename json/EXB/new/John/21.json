{"1": "\u00b7Later [L\u202fAfter these things], Jesus \u00b7showed [revealed] himself to his \u00b7followers [disciples] again\u2014this time at \u00b7Lake Galilee [L\u202fthe Sea of Tiberias; C\u202fan alternate name of Lake/the Sea of Galilee]. This is how he \u00b7showed [revealed] himself: ", "2": "Some of the \u00b7followers [disciples] were together: Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus [C\u202fmeaning \u201cthe Twin\u201d]), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee [C\u202fJames and John], and two other \u00b7followers [disciples]. ", "3": "Simon Peter said to them, \u201cI am going out to fish.\u201d The others said [L\u202fto him], \u201cWe will go with you.\u201d So they went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing.", "4": "\u00b7Early the next morning [Just at daybreak] Jesus stood on the shore, but the \u00b7followers [disciples] did not \u00b7know [realize] it was Jesus. ", "5": "Then he said to them, \u201c\u00b7Friends [L\u202fChildren; C\u202fa term of endearment], did you catch any fish?\u201d They answered, \u201cNo.\u201d", "6": "He said to them, \u201cThrow your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.\u201d So they did, and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat.", "7": "The \u00b7follower [disciple] whom Jesus loved [C\u202fJohn] said to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d [L\u202fSo] When Peter heard him say this, he wrapped his \u00b7coat [outer garment] around himself. (\u00b7Peter had taken his clothes off [L\u202ffor he was naked].) Then he jumped into the \u00b7water [L\u202fsea; lake]. ", "8": "The other \u00b7followers [disciples] went to shore in the boat, \u00b7dragging [towing] the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about a hundred yards [L\u202ftwo hundred cubits]. ", "9": "When the \u00b7followers [disciples] \u00b7stepped out of the boat and onto the shore [landed; disembarked], they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire, and there was bread.", "10": "Then Jesus said [L\u202fto them], \u201cBring some of the fish you just caught.\u201d", "11": "Simon Peter went into the boat and \u00b7pulled [hauled] the net to the shore. It was full of big fish, one hundred fifty-three in all, but even though there were so many, the net did not tear. ", "12": "Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and \u00b7eat [or have breakfast].\u201d None of the followers dared ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they knew it was the Lord. ", "13": "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, along with the fish.", "14": "This was now the third time [C\u202fsee 20:19\u201323; 20:26\u201329] Jesus \u00b7showed [revealed; manifested] himself to his \u00b7followers [disciples] after he was raised from the dead.", "15": "When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me more than these?\u201d [C\u202f\u201cThese\u201d probably refers to the other disciples (rather than the fishing gear), and could mean \u201cDo you love me more than you love your friends?\u201d or \u201cDo you love me more than they love me?\u201d The latter is more likely. This whole scene is the restoration of Peter after he had boasted of his loyalty to Jesus and then denied him.] He answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d", "16": "Again Jesus said, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201c\u00b7Take care of [Tend; Shepherd] my sheep.\u201d", "17": "A third time he said, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter \u00b7was hurt [grieved] because Jesus asked him the third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d Peter said, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\u201d He said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. [C\u202fIn verses 15 and 16 Jesus uses a different word for \u201clove\u201d (agapa\u014d) than Peter uses (phile\u014d); but then in v. 17 Jesus uses Peter's word (phile\u014d). The two terms can be synonymous, and the difference is probably stylistic. The passage is not contrasting two kinds of love; rather, Peter's three affirmations counterbalance his three denials; see 18:15\u201318, 25\u201327] ", "18": "\u00b7I tell you the truth [L\u202fTruly, truly I say to you], when you were younger, you \u00b7tied your own belt [dressed yourself] and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands and someone else will \u00b7tie [dress] you and take you where you don't want to go.\u201d ", "19": "(Jesus said this to \u00b7show [indicate; signify] how Peter would die to \u00b7give glory to [glorify] God.) Then Jesus said to Peter, \u201cFollow me!\u201d", "20": "Peter turned and saw that the \u00b7follower [disciple] Jesus loved [C\u202fJohn] was \u00b7walking behind them [following]. (This was the \u00b7follower [disciple] who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said, \u201cLord, who will \u00b7turn against [betray] you?\u201d [see 13:24\u201325]) ", "21": "When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, \u201cLord, what about him?\u201d", "22": "Jesus answered [L\u202fhim], \u201cIf I want him to live until I come back, \u00b7that is not your business [L\u202fwhat is that to you?]. You follow me.\u201d", "23": "So a \u00b7story [rumor; report; saying; L\u202fword] spread among the \u00b7followers [disciples; L\u202fbrothers] that this one would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come back, \u00b7that is not your business [what is that to you?].\u201d", "24": "That \u00b7follower [disciple] is the one who \u00b7is telling [witnesses/testifies to] these things and who has now written them down. We know that \u00b7what he says [his testimony/witness] is true.", "25": "There are many other things Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written."}

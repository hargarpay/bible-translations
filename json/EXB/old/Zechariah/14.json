They will capture the city and \u00b7rob [plunder; loot] the houses and \u00b7attack [rape] the women. Half the people will be taken away \u00b7as captives [into exile], but the rest of the people won't be taken from the city.", "3": "Then the Lord will go to war against those nations; he will fight as in a day of battle.

", "5": "You will \u00b7run [flee] through this mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel [C\u202funknown location east of Jerusalem]. You will run just as you did from the earthquake when Uzziah was king of Judah [Amos 1:1]. Then the Lord my God will come and all the holy ones [C\u202feither angels or believers; Matt. 25:31; 1 Thess. 3:13; Jude 14; Rev. 19:14] with him.", "6": "On that day there will be no light, \u00b7cold, or frost [or the sources of lights will diminish].

He blew the \u00b7trumpet [ram's horn] and said: \u201cWe have no \u00b7share [interest; portion] in David! We have no \u00b7part [inheritance; heritage] in the son of Jesse! People of Israel, \u00b7let's go home [L\u202feveryone to your tents]!\u201d", "2": "So all the Israelites \u00b7left [deserted; withdrew from] David and followed Sheba son of Bicri.

Now he put them in a \u00b7locked [guarded] house. He \u00b7gave them food [provided for them], but he did not \u00b7have sexual relations with [L\u202fgo in to] them. So they [L\u202fwere shut up/confined and] lived like widows until they died.", "4": "The king said to Amasa, \u201c\u00b7Tell the men [Mobilize the army] of Judah to meet with me \u00b7in [within] three days, and you must also be here.\u201d ", "5": "So Amasa went to \u00b7call [summon] the men of Judah together, but he \u00b7took more time [delayed longer] than the king had said.", "6": "David said to Abishai, \u201cSheba son of Bicri \u00b7is more dangerous to us than Absalom was [L\u202fwill do us more harm than Absalom].

Joab did not have to stab Amasa again; he was already dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued to \u00b7chase [pursue] Sheba son of Bicri.", "11": "One of Joab's young men stood by Amasa's body and \u00b7said [shouted], \u201cEveryone who \u00b7is for [L\u202ffavors] Joab and [L\u202fis for] David should follow Joab!\u201d ", "12": "Amasa lay in the middle of the road, \u00b7covered with [wallowing in] his own blood.

He has \u00b7turned [L\u202flifted his hand] against King David. If you \u00b7bring him to me [hand him over], I will leave the city alone.\u201d The woman said to Joab, \u201cHis head will be thrown over the wall to you.\u201d", "22": "Then the woman spoke very wisely to all the people of the city.

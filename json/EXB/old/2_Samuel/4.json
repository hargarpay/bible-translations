{"1": "When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died at Hebron, \u00b7he was shocked [he lost his courage; L\u202fhis hands grew limp] and all Israel \u00b7became frightened [was alarmed/dismayed]. ", "2": "\u00b7Two men who were captains in Saul's army came to Ish-Bosheth [Saul's son had two leaders of raiding parties]. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Recab. They were the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, who was a Benjaminite. (The town Beeroth belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. ", "3": "The people of Beeroth ran away to Gittaim, and they still live there as \u00b7foreigners [resident aliens] today.)", "4": "(Saul's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who was \u00b7crippled [lame] in both feet. He was five years old when the \u00b7news [report] came from Jezreel \u00b7that Saul and Jonathan were dead [about Saul and Jonathan]. Mephibosheth's nurse had picked him up and run away. But as she hurried to leave, she dropped him, and now he was lame.)", "5": "Recab and Baanah, sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, went to Ish-Bosheth's house in the \u00b7afternoon [L\u202fheat of the day] while he was taking \u00b7a nap [his midday rest]. ", "6-7": "They went into the middle of the house as if to get some wheat. Ish-Bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom. Then Recab and Baanah \u00b7stabbed [L\u202fstruck] him in the stomach, killed him, cut off his head, and took it with them. They escaped and traveled all night through the \u00b7Jordan Valley [L\u202fArabah]. ", "8": "When they arrived at Hebron, they \u00b7gave [brought] his head to David and said to the king, \u201cHere is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy. He \u00b7tried to kill you [sought your life]! Today the Lord has \u00b7paid back [given my lord the king revenge on] Saul and his \u00b7family [offspring; descendants; L\u202fseed] for what they did to you!\u201d", "9": "David answered Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, he has \u00b7saved [L\u202fransomed; redeemed] me from all \u00b7trouble [danger; adversity; or my enemies]! ", "10": "Once a man thought he was bringing me good news. When he told me, 'Saul is dead!' I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news [1:1\u201316]! ", "11": "\u00b7So even more I must [L\u202fHow much more must I\u2026?] put you evil men to death because you have killed an \u00b7innocent [righteous] man on his own bed in his own house!\u201d", "12": "So David commanded his men to kill Recab and Baanah. They cut off the hands and feet of Recab and Baanah and hung \u00b7them [their bodies] \u00b7over [beside] the pool of Hebron. Then they took Ish-Bosheth's head and buried it in Abner's \u00b7tomb [grave] at Hebron."}

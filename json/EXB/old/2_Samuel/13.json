{"1": "[L\u202fSometime later; After this] David had a son named Absalom and a son named Amnon. Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and Amnon loved her. ", "2": "Tamar was a virgin. Amnon made himself sick \u00b7just thinking about her [by his obsession/frustration with her], because \u00b7he could not find any chance to be alone with her [it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her; it appeared he could never have her].", "3": "Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very \u00b7clever [shrewd; crafty; wise] man. ", "4": "He asked Amnon, \u201cSon of the king, why do you look so \u00b7sad [depressed; dejected] \u00b7day after day [L\u202fmorning after morning]? Tell me what's wrong!\u201d Amnon told him, \u201cI love Tamar, the sister of my \u00b7half-brother [L\u202fbrother] Absalom.\u201d", "5": "Jonadab said to Amnon, \u201cGo to bed and \u00b7act as if you are [pretend to be] sick. \u00b7Then [When\u2026] your father will come to see you. Tell him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come in and give me food to eat. Let her make the food in front of me so I can watch and eat it from her hand.'\u201d", "6": "So Amnon went to bed and acted sick. When King David came in to see him, Amnon said to him, \u201cPlease let my sister Tamar come in. Let her make \u00b7two of her special cakes [some special bread] for me while I watch. Then I will eat them from her hands.\u201d", "7": "David sent for Tamar in the palace, saying, \u201cGo to your brother Amnon's house and make some food for him.\u201d ", "8": "So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was \u00b7in bed [L\u202flying down]. Tamar took some dough and \u00b7pressed it together with her hands [kneaded it]. She made some special \u00b7cakes [bread] while Amnon watched. Then she baked them. ", "9": "Next she took the pan and \u00b7served him [L\u202fdished/poured them out before him], but he refused to eat. He said to his servants, \u201c\u00b7All of you, leave me alone [Everyone get out of here]!\u201d So they all \u00b7left him alone [got out]. ", "10": "Amnon said to Tamar, \u201cBring the food into the \u00b7bedroom [inner room] so I may eat from your hand.\u201d Tamar took the \u00b7cakes [bread] she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the \u00b7bedroom [inner room]. ", "11": "She went to him so he could eat from her hands, but Amnon grabbed her. He said, \u201cSister, come and \u00b7have sexual relations [L\u202flie] with me.\u201d", "12": "Tamar said to him, \u201cNo, [L\u202fmy] brother! Don't \u00b7force [violate; rape; L\u202fhumiliate] me! This \u00b7should never be [isn't] done in Israel! Don't do this \u00b7shameful [disgraceful; wicked; vile] thing! ", "13": "\u00b7I could never [L\u202fWhere could I\u2026?] get rid of my shame! And you will be \u00b7like the shameful [one of the greatest] \u00b7fools [scoundrels] in Israel! Please talk with the king, and he will \u00b7let you marry [L\u202fnot refuse your marrying] me.\u201d", "14": "But Amnon refused to listen to her. He was stronger than she was, so he \u00b7forced her to have sexual relations with him [raped/L\u202fhumiliated her and lay with her]. ", "15": "After that, Amnon hated Tamar [L\u202fintensely; with a great hatred]. He hated her more than he had loved her before. Amnon said to her, \u201cGet \u00b7up and leave [out]!\u201d", "16": "Tamar said to him, \u201cNo! Sending me away would be \u00b7worse [a greater wrong] than what you've already done [L\u202fto me]!\u201d But he refused to listen to her. ", "17": "He called his young \u00b7servant [L\u202fman] back in and said, \u201cGet this woman out of here and away from me! Lock the door \u00b7after [behind] her.\u201d ", "18": "So his servant led her out of the room and bolted the door \u00b7after [behind] her. Tamar was wearing a special robe with long sleeves, because the king's virgin daughters wore this kind of robe. ", "19": "Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her special robe [C\u202fa sign of mourning or distress]. \u00b7Putting her hand on her head [or with her face in her hands], she went away, crying loudly.", "20": "Absalom, Tamar's brother, said to her, \u201cHas Amnon, your brother, \u00b7forced you to have sexual relations with him [L\u202fbeen with you]? For now, sister, \u00b7be quiet [keep silent]. He is your half-brother. Don't \u00b7let this upset you so much [worry about this; L\u202ftake this to heart]!\u201d So Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house and was \u00b7sad and lonely [desolate and inconsolable].", "21": "When King David heard the news, he was very angry. ", "22": "Absalom did not say a word, good or bad, to Amnon. But he hated Amnon for \u00b7disgracing [violating; raping; L\u202fhumiliating] his sister Tamar.", "23": "Two years later Absalom had some men come to Baal Hazor, near Ephraim, to cut the wool from his sheep. Absalom invited all the king's sons to come also [C\u202ffor a feast]. ", "24": "Absalom went to the king and said, \u201cI have men coming to cut the wool. Please come with your \u00b7officers [attendants; L\u202fservants] and join \u00b7me [L\u202fyour servant].\u201d", "25": "King David said to Absalom, \u201cNo, my son. We won't all go, because it would be too much \u00b7trouble [of a burden] for you.\u201d Although Absalom \u00b7begged [urged; pressed] David, he would not go, but he did give his blessing.", "26": "Absalom said, \u201cIf you don't want to come, then please let my brother Amnon come with us.\u201d King David asked, \u201cWhy should he go with you?\u201d", "27": "Absalom kept \u00b7begging [urging; pressing] David until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with Absalom.", "28": "Then Absalom instructed his \u00b7servants [L\u202fmen], \u201cWatch Amnon. When \u00b7he is drunk [he's in high spirits; L\u202fhis heart is merry with wine], I will tell you, '\u00b7Kill [L\u202fStrike] Amnon.' Right then, kill him! Don't be afraid, because I have \u00b7commanded [ordered] you! Be \u00b7strong [courageous] and \u00b7brave [valiant]!\u201d ", "29": "So Absalom's \u00b7young men [servants] killed Amnon as Absalom \u00b7commanded [ordered], \u00b7but [then] all of David's other sons got on their mules and \u00b7escaped [fled].", "30": "While the king's sons were on their way [C\u202fback to Jerusalem], the news came to David, \u201cAbsalom has \u00b7killed [L\u202fstruck down] all of the king's sons! Not one of them is left alive!\u201d ", "31": "King David [L\u202fgot up,] tore his clothes [C\u202fa sign of mourning or distress] and \u00b7lay [threw himself] on the ground.

A \u00b7guard [watchman] standing on the city wall saw many people coming [L\u202fon the road] from the other side of the hill.

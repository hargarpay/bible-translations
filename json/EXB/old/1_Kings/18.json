{"1": "During the third year without rain, the \u00b7Lord spoke his word [L\u202fword of the Lord came] to Elijah: \u201cGo and \u00b7meet [present/show yourself to] King Ahab, and I will soon send rain.\u201d ", "2": "So Elijah went to \u00b7meet [present/show himself to] Ahab.

Obadiah recognized Elijah, so he \u00b7bowed down to the ground [L\u202ffell on his face] and said, \u201cElijah?

The god who answers by \u00b7setting fire to his wood is the true [fire\u2014he is] God [C\u202fBaal, the storm god, threw lightening from the sky].\u201d All the people agreed that this was a good idea.", "25": "Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \u201cThere are many of you, so you go first. Choose a \u00b7bull [ox] and prepare it. \u00b7Pray to [L\u202fCall on the name of] your god, but don't start the fire.\u201d", "26": "So they took the \u00b7bull [ox] that was given to them and prepared it.

They \u00b7danced [leaped; or limped; C\u202f\u201climped\u201d may suggest that Israel had hobbled itself by worshiping both God and Baal] around the altar they had built.", "27": "At noon Elijah began to \u00b7make fun of [mock; taunt] them. \u201c\u00b7Pray [Call; Shout] louder!\u201d he said. \u201c\u00b7If Baal really is [Since he is surely] a god, maybe he is \u00b7thinking [preoccupied; daydreaming], or \u00b7busy [has wandered away], or \u00b7traveling [is on a trip/journey]!

", "29": "The afternoon passed, and the prophets \u00b7continued to act like this [raved; ranted] until it was time for the evening sacrifice. But no voice was heard; Baal did not answer, and no one paid attention.", "30": "Then Elijah said to all the people, \u201cNow come \u00b7to [near/closer to] me.\u201d So they gathered around him, and Elijah \u00b7rebuilt [repaired] the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down [C\u202fthe remains of a previous altar to God]. ", "31": "He took twelve stones, one stone for each of the twelve tribes [C\u202fsymbolizing a previously unified Israel; cf Josh. 4:2\u201320], the number of Jacob's sons.

Then he dug a \u00b7ditch [trench] around the altar that was big enough to hold \u00b7about thirteen quarts [L\u202ftwo measures/seahs] of seed.

Then he said, \u201cDo it a third time,\u201d and they did it the third time.

Otherwise, the rain will stop him.\u201d", "45": "After a short time the sky \u00b7was covered with dark [grew black with] clouds. The wind began to blow, and soon a \u00b7heavy [torrential] rain began to fall [C\u202fshowing that it was the Lord, not Baal, that supplied the rain].

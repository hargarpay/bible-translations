{"1": "It was the month of Nisan [C\u202fearly spring] in the twentieth year Artaxerxes was king [C\u202f445 bc]. Wine was brought \u00b7for him [or to me]. I took some and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before. ", "2": "So the king said, \u201cWhy does your face look sad even though you are not sick? \u00b7Your heart must be sad [You must be very troubled].\u201d Then I was very afraid. ", "3": "I said to the king, \u201cMay the king live forever! \u00b7My face is sad because [L\u202fWhy should my face not look sad/dejected when\u2026?] the city \u00b7where my ancestors are buried [of my fathers' tombs] lies in ruins, and its gates have been \u00b7destroyed [L\u202fdevoured] by fire.\u201d", "4": "Then the king said to me, \u201cWhat do you \u00b7want [seek; request]?\u201d \u00b7First [Then; So] I prayed to the God of heaven. ", "5": "Then I answered the king, \u201cIf \u00b7you are willing [it pleases/is good to you] and if I have \u00b7pleased you [found favor in your sight], send me to Judah, to the city \u00b7where my ancestors are buried [of my fathers' tombs; C\u202fJerusalem] so I can rebuild it.\u201d", "6": "The queen was sitting next to the king. He asked me, \u201cHow long will your \u00b7trip [journey] take, and when will you get back?\u201d It \u00b7pleased [L\u202fwas good to] the king to send me, so I set a time.", "7": "I also said to him, \u201cIf \u00b7you are willing [it pleases/is good to you], give me letters for the governors of \u00b7Trans-Euphrates [C\u202fprovinces west of the Euphrates River]. Tell them to let me pass safely through their lands \u00b7on my way to [until I reach] Judah. ", "8": "And may I have a letter for Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, telling him to give me timber? I will need it to make \u00b7boards [beams] for the gates of the \u00b7palace [or fortress], which is by the \u00b7Temple [L\u202fhouse], and for the city wall, and for the house in which I will live.\u201d So the king \u00b7gave [granted] me the letters, because \u00b7God was showing kindness to me [L\u202fthe gracious/good hand of God was on me]. ", "9": "Then I went to the governors of \u00b7Trans-Euphrates [C\u202fprovinces west of the Euphrates River] and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and \u00b7horsemen [cavalry] with me.", "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite \u00b7officer [official] heard about this, they were \u00b7upset [very displeased] that someone had come to \u00b7help [promote/seek the welfare of] the Israelites.", "11": "I went to Jerusalem and \u00b7stayed there three days [or after three days\u2026]. ", "12": "Then at night I started out with a few men. I had not told anyone what God had \u00b7caused me [put in my mind/heart] to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me except the one I was riding.", "13": "I went out at night through the Valley Gate. I rode toward the Dragon Well and the \u00b7Trash [Garbage; Refuse; T\u202fDung] Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been \u00b7destroyed [devoured] by fire. ", "14": "Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for the animal I was riding to pass through. ", "15": "So I went up the \u00b7valley [ravine; C\u202flikely the Kidron Valley; many of these walls no longer exist] at night, inspecting the wall. Finally, I turned and went back in through the Valley Gate. ", "16": "The \u00b7guards [officials] did not know where I had gone or what I was doing. I had not yet said anything to the Jewish people, the priests, the \u00b7important men [nobles], the \u00b7officers [officials], or any of the others who would do the work.", "17": "Then I said to them, \u201cYou can see the trouble we \u00b7have here [are in]. Jerusalem is \u00b7a pile of ruins [desolate], and its gates have been burned. Come, let's rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so we won't be \u00b7full of shame [disgraced; humiliated] any longer.\u201d ", "18": "I also told them how \u00b7God had been kind to [the gracious hand of God had been on] me and what the king had said to me. Then they answered, \u201cLet's start rebuilding.\u201d So they \u00b7began to work hard [L\u202fstrengthened their hands for this good work].", "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite officer, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they \u00b7made fun of us and laughed at [mocked and ridiculed/jeered at] us. They said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you \u00b7turning [rebelling] against the king?\u201d", "20": "But I answered them, \u201cThe God of heaven will \u00b7give us success [prosper us]. We, his servants, will start rebuilding, but you have no share, claim, or \u00b7memorial [historic/ancient right] in Jerusalem.\u201d"}

{"1": "It was in the eleventh year [C\u202fsince King Jehoiachin's exile (1:2)], in the third month, on the first day of the month [C\u202fJune 21, 587 bc]. The \u00b7Lord spoke his word [L\u202fword of the Lord came] to me, saying: ", "2": "\u201c\u00b7Human [T\u202fSon of man; 2:1], say to the king of Egypt and his people: '\u00b7No one [L\u202fWho\u2026?] is like you in your greatness.", "3": "[L\u202fLook; T\u202fBehold] Assyria was once like a cedar tree in Lebanon with beautiful branches that shaded the forest. It was \u00b7very tall [a towering height]; its top was among the clouds.", "4": "Much water made the tree grow; the deep springs made it tall. Rivers flowed around \u00b7the bottom of the tree [its place of planting] and sent their \u00b7streams [channels] to all other trees \u00b7in the countryside [of the field].", "5": "So the tree was taller than all the other trees \u00b7in the countryside [of the field]. Its \u00b7limbs [boughs] became large and its branches long because of \u00b7so much [abundant] water.", "6": "All the birds of the \u00b7sky [heavens] made their nests in the tree's \u00b7limbs [boughs; Dan. 4:12, 21]. And all the \u00b7wild animals [beasts of the field] gave birth under its branches. All great nations lived in the tree's shade.", "7": "So the tree was great and beautiful, with its long branches, because its roots reached down to \u00b7much [abundant] water.", "8": "The cedar trees in the garden of God [C\u202fEden] were not as great as it was. The \u00b7pine [fir; juniper] trees \u00b7did not have such great [could not equal its] \u00b7limbs [boughs]. The plane trees did not have such branches. No tree in the garden of God was as beautiful as this tree.", "9": "I made it beautiful with many branches, and all the trees of Eden in the garden of God \u00b7wanted to be like [envied] it.", "10": "\u201c'So this is what the Lord God says: The tree grew tall. Its top reached the clouds, and it became proud of its height. ", "11": "So I handed it \u00b7over to [L\u202finto the hand of] a mighty ruler of the nations for him to \u00b7punish [deal with] it. Because it was \u00b7evil [wicked], I \u00b7got rid of it [threw it out; cast it aside]. ", "12": "The \u00b7cruelest [most ruthless] foreign nation cut it down and left it. The tree's branches fell on the mountains and in all the valleys, and its \u00b7broken limbs [boughs] were in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth left the shade of that tree.

", "14": "So the trees that grow by the water will not \u00b7be proud to be [or grow so] tall; they will not put their tops among the clouds. None of the trees that are watered well will grow that tall, because they all are \u00b7meant [appointed; consigned] to die and go \u00b7under the ground [or to the underworld; to the depths of the earth]. They will be with \u00b7people who have died [mortals; L\u202fsons of men] and \u00b7have gone down [those who descend] to the \u00b7place of the dead [L\u202fpit].", "15": "\u201c'This is what the Lord God says: On the day \u00b7when the tree [L\u202fit; C\u202fAssyria] went down to \u00b7the place of the dead [L\u202fSheol], I \u00b7made the deep springs cry loudly [or caused mourning]. I \u00b7covered them [or closed the deep over it] and held back their rivers, and the great waters \u00b7stopped flowing [were restrained]. I dressed Lebanon \u00b7in black [or with gloom; C\u202fin mourning for the great tree], and all the trees in the countryside \u00b7were sad about it [wilted; fainted]. ", "16": "I made the nations \u00b7shake with fear [tremble; quake] at the sound of the tree falling when I brought it down to \u00b7the place of the dead [Sheol]. It went to join those who \u00b7have gone down [descend] to the \u00b7grave [pit; C\u202fthe trees represent other great nations that have fallen]. Then all the trees of Eden and the best and \u00b7most beautiful [choicest] trees of Lebanon, all the well-watered trees, were comforted in the \u00b7place of the dead below the earth [underworld; world below].

You will lie among \u00b7unclean people [L\u202fthe uncircumcised], with those who were killed \u00b7in war [L\u202fby the sword]. \u201c'This is about Pharaoh and all his \u00b7people [hordes; armies], says the Lord God.'\u201d"}

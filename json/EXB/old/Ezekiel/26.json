{"1": "It was the eleventh year [C\u202fsince King Jehoiachin's exile (1:2); 586 bc], on the first day of the month. The \u00b7Lord spoke his word [L\u202fword of the Lord came] to me, saying: ", "2": "\u201c\u00b7Human [T\u202fSon of man; 2:1], the city of Tyre has spoken against Jerusalem: 'The \u00b7city that traded with [L\u202fgate of] the nations is \u00b7destroyed [broken]. \u00b7Now we can be the trading center [L\u202fIts doors have swung open to me]. Since \u00b7the city of Jerusalem [L\u202fit] is ruined, \u00b7we can make money [L\u202fI will be filled].' ", "3": "So this is what the Lord God says: [L\u202fLook; T\u202fBehold] I am against you, Tyre. I will bring many nations against you, like the sea \u00b7beating its waves on your island shores [L\u202fbrings up its waves]. ", "4": "They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers. I will also scrape away her \u00b7ruins [rubble; soil] and make her a bare rock. ", "5": "Tyre will be \u00b7an island [L\u202fin the midst of the sea] where fishermen dry their nets. I have spoken, says the Lord God. \u00b7The nations will steal treasures from Tyre [L\u202fShe will become plunder for the nations]. ", "6": "Also, her \u00b7villages [settlements; L\u202fdaughters] on the \u00b7shore [mainland] across from the island will be \u00b7destroyed by war [L\u202fslaughtered by the sword]. Then they will know that I am the Lord.", "7": "\u201cThis is what the Lord God says: [L\u202fLook; T\u202fBehold] I will bring a king from the north against Tyre. He is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, \u00b7the greatest king [L\u202fking of kings], with his horses, chariots, horsemen, and a great army. ", "8": "He will destroy your \u00b7villages [settlements; L\u202fdaughters] on the \u00b7shore across from the island [mainland]. He will set up \u00b7devices to attack you [siege works]. He will build a \u00b7road of earth to the top of the walls [siege ramp]. He will raise his shields against you. ", "9": "He will \u00b7bring logs to pound through [direct blows of battering rams against] your city walls, and he will break down your towers with his \u00b7iron bars [or hammers; L\u202fswords]. ", "10": "His horses will be so many that they will cover you with their dust. Your walls will shake at the noise of horsemen, wagons, and chariots. The king of Babylon will enter your city gates as men enter a city where the walls are broken through. ", "11": "The hoofs of his horses will \u00b7run over [trample] your streets. He will kill your \u00b7army [or people] with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall down to the ground. ", "12": "Also, his men will \u00b7take away [plunder] your riches and will \u00b7steal [loot] \u00b7the things you sell [your merchandise].

", "13": "So I will stop your songs; the music of your \u00b7harps [lyres] will not be heard anymore. ", "14": "I will make you a bare rock, and you will be a place for \u00b7drying [spreading] fishing nets. You will not be built again, because I, the Lord, have spoken, says the Lord God.", "15": "\u201cThis is what the Lord God says to Tyre: \u00b7The people who live along the seacoast will [L\u202fWon't the coastlands\u2026?] \u00b7shake with fear [tremble] \u00b7when they hear about your defeat [or at the sound of your fall]. \u00b7The injured will [L\u202f\u2026when the wounded] groan as the \u00b7killing [slaughter] takes place in you.

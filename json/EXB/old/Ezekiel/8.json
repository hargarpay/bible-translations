{"1": "It was the sixth year [C\u202fsince king Jehoiachin's exile (1:2)], on the fifth day of the sixth month [C\u202fSeptember 17, 592 bc; this vision is the subject of chapters 8\u201311]. I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah in front of me. There \u00b7I felt the power of the Lord God [L\u202fthe hand of the Lord God came upon me]. ", "2": "I looked and saw something that looked like a \u00b7human [man]. From the waist down it looked like fire, and from the waist up it looked like bright glowing \u00b7metal [or amber]. ", "3": "\u00b7It [or He] stretched out the shape of a hand and caught me by the hair on my head. \u00b7The Spirit [or A spirit; or The wind] lifted me up between the earth and \u00b7the sky [heaven]. He took me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple. In the courtyard was the \u00b7idol that caused God to be jealous [L\u202fimage of jealousy; 2 Kin. 21:7; 2 Chr. 33:7, 15]. ", "4": "I saw the glory of the God of Israel [C\u202fhis manifest presence] there, as I had seen \u00b7on the plain [in the valley].", "5": "Then he said to me, \u201c\u00b7Human [T\u202fSon of man; 2:1], now look toward the north.\u201d So I looked up toward the north, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar was the \u00b7idol that caused God to be jealous [image of jealousy].", "6": "He said to me, \u201c\u00b7Human [T\u202fSon of man; 2:1], do you see what they are doing? Do you see how many \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable] things the \u00b7people [L\u202fhouse] of Israel are doing here that drive me far away from my \u00b7Temple [sanctuary]? But you will see things more \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable] than these.\u201d", "7": "Then he brought me to the entry of the courtyard. When I looked, I saw a hole in the wall. ", "8": "He said to me, \u201c\u00b7Human [T\u202fSon of man], dig through the wall.\u201d So I dug through the wall and saw an \u00b7entrance [doorway].", "9": "Then he said to me, \u201cGo in and see the \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable], \u00b7evil [wicked] things they are doing here.\u201d ", "10": "So I entered and looked, and \u00b7I saw [L\u202flook; T\u202fbehold] every kind of crawling thing [Lev. 11:20] and hateful beast [C\u202funclean animal, ritually] and all the idols of the \u00b7people [L\u202fhouse] of Israel, \u00b7carved [engraved] on the wall all around [C\u202fsuch images were idolatrous; Deut. 4:16\u201318; Rom. 1:23].

Each man had his \u00b7pan for burning incense [censer] in his hand, and a \u00b7sweet-smelling [fragrant] cloud of incense was rising.", "12": "Then he said to me, \u201c\u00b7Human [T\u202fSon of man; 2:1], have you seen what the elders of [L\u202fthe house of] Israel are doing in the dark? Have you seen each man in the \u00b7room [chamber; shrine] of his own \u00b7idol [carved image]? They say, 'The Lord doesn't see us. The Lord has \u00b7left [abandoned; forsaken] the land.'\u201d ", "13": "He also said to me, \u201cYou will see even more \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable] things that they are doing.\u201d", "14": "Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the \u00b7Temple [L\u202fhouse] of the Lord, where I saw women sitting and crying for Tammuz [C\u202fa Babylonian god of fertility and rain, whose annual death marked the change of seasons]. ", "15": "He said to me, \u201cDo you see, \u00b7human [T\u202fson of man; 2:1]? You will see things even more \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable] than these.\u201d", "16": "Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the \u00b7Temple [L\u202fhouse of the Lord]. There I saw about twenty-five men at the entrance to the \u00b7Temple [L\u202fhouse] of the Lord, between the \u00b7porch [portico] and the altar. With their backs turned to the Temple of the Lord, they faced east and were worshiping the sun in the east.", "17": "He said to me, \u201cDo you see, \u00b7human [T\u202fson of man; 2:1]? Is it \u00b7unimportant [a trivial thing] that the \u00b7people [L\u202fhouse] of Judah are doing the \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable] things they have done here? They have filled the land with violence and \u00b7made me continually angry [provoked me to still greater anger]. \u00b7Look [T\u202fBehold], they are \u00b7insulting me every way they can [L\u202fputting the branch to their nose; C\u202fperhaps part of the worship of the sun god]. ", "18": "So I will act \u00b7in anger [with wrath]. I will have no pity, nor will I \u00b7show mercy [spare them]. Even if they shout in my ears, I won't listen to them.\u201d"}

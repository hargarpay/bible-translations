Among them was a man dressed in linen with a writing case at his side. The men went in and stood by the bronze altar [Ex. 27:1\u20138].", "3": "Then the glory of the God of Israel [C\u202fhis manifest presence] went up from above the \u00b7creatures with wings [L\u202fcherubim], where it had been, to the place in the \u00b7Temple where the door opened [L\u202fthreshold of the house]. He called to the man dressed in linen who had the writing case at his side. ", "4": "The Lord said to the man, \u201cGo through Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the people who groan and cry about all the \u00b7hateful [detestable; abominable] things being done among them [Rev. 3:12; 7:3; 9:4; 14:1; 22:4].\u201d", "5": "As I listened, he said to the other men, \u201cGo through the city behind the man dressed in linen and \u00b7kill [strike]. Don't [L\u202flet your eye] pity anyone, and don't \u00b7show mercy [spare them]. ", "6": "Kill and destroy old men, young men and \u00b7women [virgins], little children, and older women, but don't touch any who have the mark on them. Start at my \u00b7Temple [sanctuary].\u201d So they started with the \u00b7elders [or old men] who were in front of the \u00b7Temple [L\u202fhouse].", "7": "Then he said to the men, \u201c\u00b7Make the Temple unclean [Defile the temple; C\u202fritually], and fill the courtyards with \u00b7those who have been killed [the slain]. Go out!\u201d So the men went out and killed the people in the city. ", "8": "While they were \u00b7killing the people [striking them down], I was left alone. I bowed facedown on the ground and I cried out, \u201cOh, Lord God! Will you destroy \u00b7everyone left alive in [the whole remnant of] Israel when you \u00b7turn loose your anger [pour out your wrath] on Jerusalem?\u201d", "9": "Then he said to me, \u201cThe sin of the \u00b7people [L\u202fhouse] of Israel and Judah is very great. The land is filled with people who murder, and the city is full of \u00b7people who are not fair [injustice; corruption]. The people say, 'The Lord has \u00b7left [abandoned; forsaken] the land, and the Lord does not see.' ", "10": "But \u00b7I [L\u202fmy eye] will have no pity, nor will I \u00b7show mercy [spare]. I will bring their \u00b7evil [deeds; L\u202fway] back on their heads.\u201d", "11": "Then the man dressed in linen with the writing case at his side reported, \u201cI have done just as you commanded me.\u201d"}

{"1": "Jehoshaphat \u00b7died [L\u202flay down/T\u202fslept with his fathers/ancestors] and was buried with his \u00b7ancestors [fathers] in the City of David [C\u202fJerusalem]. Then his son Jehoram became king in his place. ", "2": "Jehoram's brothers were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. They were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of \u00b7Judah [L\u202fIsrael; 12:6]. ", "3": "Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and \u00b7valuable [precious] things, and he gave them \u00b7strong, walled [fortified] cities in Judah. But Jehoshaphat gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the \u00b7first son [firstborn].", "4": "When Jehoram took control of his father's kingdom and \u00b7made himself secure [established himself], he killed all his brothers with the sword and also killed some of the \u00b7leaders [officials] of Judah. ", "5": "He was thirty-two years old when he began to \u00b7rule [reign], and he \u00b7ruled [reigned] eight years in Jerusalem. ", "6": "He \u00b7followed [L\u202fwalked] in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] of Ahab had done, because he married Ahab's daughter. Jehoram did \u00b7what the Lord said was wrong [L\u202fevil in the Lord's sight/eyes]. ", "7": "But the Lord would not destroy David's \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] because of the \u00b7agreement [covenant; treaty] he had made with David. He had promised \u00b7that one of David's descendants would always rule [L\u202fto give a lamp to David and his descendants/sons forever; C\u202fhere a lamp symbolizes a dynasty].", "8": "In Jehoram's time, Edom \u00b7broke away from [revolted/rebelled against] Judah's \u00b7rule [reign] and \u00b7chose [set up] their own king.

The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot \u00b7commanders [officers], but Jehoram got up and attacked the Edomites at night [C\u202fthe implication is that Jehoram is victorious, but the next verse suggests otherwise; see 2 Kin. 8:21]. ", "10": "From then until now the country of Edom has \u00b7fought against [been free from] the \u00b7rule [reign] of Judah. At the same time the people of Libnah also \u00b7broke away from [rebelled/revolted against] Jehoram because Jehoram \u00b7left [abandoned; forsook] the Lord, the God of his \u00b7ancestors [fathers].", "11": "Jehoram also built \u00b7places to worship gods [L\u202fhigh places; 11:15] on the hills in Judah.

", "13": "But you have \u00b7lived as the kings of Israel lived [L\u202fwalked in the way of the kings of Israel], leading the people of Judah and Jerusalem to \u00b7sin against God [commit adultery; L\u202fplay the harlot], as Ahab and his \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] did. You have killed your brothers, your own family, and they were better than you.

", "17": "So the Philistines and Arabs attacked and invaded Judah and carried away all the wealth of Jehoram's \u00b7palace [L\u202fhouse], as well as his sons and wives. Only Jehoram's youngest son, Ahaziah, was left.", "18": "After these things happened, the Lord \u00b7gave Jehoram [struck/afflicted/T\u202fsmote him with] a disease in his \u00b7intestines [bowels] that could not be cured.

The people did not make a funeral fire to honor Jehoram as they had done for his \u00b7ancestors [fathers].", "20": "Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he \u00b7ruled [reigned] eight years in Jerusalem. No one \u00b7was sad [regretted] when he died. He was buried in the City of David [C\u202fJerusalem], but not in the \u00b7graves for [tombs of] the kings."}

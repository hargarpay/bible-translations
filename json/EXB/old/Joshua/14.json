The people of the nine-and-a-half tribes threw lots [C\u202fcasting lots left the decision to God; the Urim and Thummim may have been used; Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21] to decide which land they would receive.

Among them was Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite. He said to Joshua, \u201cYou remember what the Lord said at Kadesh Barnea when he was speaking to \u00b7the prophet Moses [L\u202fMoses, the man of God] about you and me [Num. 14:6\u20139, 24, 30].

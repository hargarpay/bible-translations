{"1": "But the \u00b7Israelites [L\u202fsons/T\u202fchildren of Israel] \u00b7did not obey the Lord [L\u202facted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things; 6:17]. There was a man from the tribe of Judah named Achan. (He was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, who was the son of Zerah.) Because Achan kept some of the \u00b7things that were to be given to the Lord [L\u202fdevoted things], the \u00b7Lord became very angry [L\u202fLord's anger burned] at the Israelites.", "2": "Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai [C\u202fthe name means \u201cdump,\u201d indicating that it should have been an easy military target], which was near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He told them, \u201cGo to Ai and spy out the area.\u201d So the men went to spy on Ai.", "3": "Later they came back to Joshua and said, \u201cThere are \u00b7only a few people [few soldiers] in Ai, so we will not need all our people to defeat them. Send only two or three thousand men to fight. \u00b7There is no need to send [or Don't tire out] all of our people.\u201d ", "4": "So about three thousand men went up to Ai, but \u00b7the people of Ai beat them badly [L\u202fthey fled from the men of Ai]. ", "5": "The people of Ai killed about thirty-six Israelites and then chased the rest from the city gate all the way down to \u00b7the canyon [or the stone quarries; or Shebarim], killing them as they went down the hill. When the Israelites saw this, \u00b7they lost their courage [L\u202fthe heart of the people melted and became like water].", "6": "Then Joshua tore his \u00b7clothes in sorrow [L\u202fclothes]. He \u00b7bowed [fell] facedown on the ground before the Ark of the Lord and stayed there until evening. The \u00b7leaders [L\u202felders] of Israel did the same thing. They also threw \u00b7dirt [dust] on their heads [C\u202fto show their sorrow]. ", "7": "Then Joshua said, \u201c\u00b7Lord God [or Sovereign Lord], why did you bring our people across the Jordan River \u00b7and then let the Amorites destroy us [to give us into the hands of the Amorites]? \u00b7We would have [L\u202fIf only we had] been happy to stay on the other side of the Jordan. ", "8": "Lord, \u00b7there is nothing I can say now [what can I say now that\u2026]. Israel has \u00b7been beaten by [fled from; L\u202fturned their back before] the enemy. ", "9": "The Canaanites and all the other people in this country will hear about this and will \u00b7surround [encircle] and \u00b7kill us all [L\u202fcut off our name from the earth]!

They \u00b7turn away from the fight and run [fled/turned their backs before their enemies], because I have \u00b7commanded that they be destroyed [devoted them for destruction].

", "17": "So the \u00b7family groups [clans] of Judah presented themselves, and the Lord then chose the \u00b7family group [clan] of Zerah. When all the \u00b7families [clan] of Zerah presented themselves, the family of Zabdi was chosen. ", "18": "And Joshua told all the men in that family to present themselves. The Lord chose Achan son of Carmi. (Carmi was the son of Zabdi, who was the son of Zerah.)", "19": "Then Joshua said to Achan, \u201cMy son, \u00b7tell the truth.

This is what I did: ", "21": "Among the things I saw was a beautiful \u00b7coat [robe; cloak] from \u00b7Babylonia [L\u202fShinar] and about \u00b7five pounds [L\u202ftwo hundred shekels] of silver and \u00b7more than one and one-fourth pounds of gold [L\u202fa gold bar weighing fifty shekels]. I wanted these things very much for myself, so I took them. You will find them buried in the ground under my tent, with the silver underneath.\u201d", "22": "So Joshua sent \u00b7men [L\u202fmessengers] who ran to the tent and \u00b7found the things [T\u202fbehold, it was] hidden there, with the silver underneath.

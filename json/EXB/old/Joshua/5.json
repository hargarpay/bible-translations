During that time all the fighting men who had left Egypt had died because they had not obeyed the Lord [Num. 13\u201314]. So the Lord swore they would not see the land he had promised their ancestors to give them, a \u00b7fertile land [L\u202fland flowing with milk and honey; C\u202fa phrase describing the natural bounty of the land]. ", "7": "Their sons \u00b7took [were raised up in] their places. But none of the sons born on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised, so Joshua circumcised them.

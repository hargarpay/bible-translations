{"1": "When Jabin king of Hazor [C\u202fthe largest and best fortified of the Canaanite cities] heard about all that had happened, he sent messages to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Acshaph. ", "2": "He sent messages to the kings in the northern \u00b7mountains [hill country] and also to the kings in the \u00b7Jordan Valley [or Arabah] south of \u00b7Lake Galilee [L\u202fKinnereth] and in the \u00b7western foothills [lowlands; L\u202fShephelah]. He sent a message to the king of \u00b7Naphoth [or the heights of] Dor in the west [C\u202fthe coastal plain south of Mount Carmel] ", "3": "and to the kings of the Canaanites in the east and in the west. He sent messages to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the \u00b7mountains [hill country]. Jabin also sent one to the Hivites, who lived below Mount Hermon in the area of Mizpah [C\u202fa coalition of the northern cities of Palestine]. ", "4": "So the armies of all these kings came together with their horses and chariots [C\u202fa great challenge to the Israelites, who only had foot soldiers]. There were as many soldiers as grains of sand on the seashore [Gen. 22:17].", "5": "All of these kings met together at the waters of Merom [C\u202fprobably modern Meirun, eight miles northwest of the Sea of Galilee], joined their armies together into one camp, and made plans to fight against the Israelites.", "6": "Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cDon't be afraid of them, because at this time tomorrow I will give them to you. You will \u00b7cripple [hamstring] their horses and burn all their chariots.\u201d", "7": "So Joshua and his whole army surprised the enemy [10:9] by attacking them at the waters of Merom. ", "8": "The Lord \u00b7handed them over to [L\u202fgave them into the hand of] Israel. They chased them to Greater Sidon, Misrephoth Maim, and the Valley of Mizpah in the east [C\u202flocations north and west of the battle]. Israel fought until none of the enemy was left alive. ", "9": "Joshua did what the Lord said to do; he \u00b7crippled [hamstrung] their horses and burned their chariots [C\u202fIsrael did not take the horses and chariots to use themselves, in order to show their trust in God; Ps. 20:7].", "10": "Then Joshua went back and captured the city of Hazor and \u00b7killed [L\u202fstruck with the sword] its king. (Hazor had been the leader of all the kingdoms that fought against Israel.) ", "11": "Israel \u00b7killed [L\u202fstruck with the sword] everyone in Hazor, \u00b7completely destroying them [devoting them to destruction; 2:10; 6:21]; no one was left \u00b7alive [L\u202fthat breathed].

He did this just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded. ", "13": "But the Israelites did not burn any cities that were built on their mounds [C\u202fso Israel could immediately occupy these strategically important cities; Deut. 6:10\u201311], except Hazor; only that city was burned by Joshua.

He had control of the mountains and \u00b7the area of southern Canaan [L\u202fall the Negev], all the areas of Goshen, the \u00b7western foothills [lowlands; L\u202fShephelah], and the \u00b7Jordan Valley [or Arabah]. He controlled the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Israel and \u00b7all the hills near them [or its lowlands/L\u202fShephelah].

Joshua also captured all the kings in the land and killed them. ", "18": "He \u00b7fought [waged war] against them for \u00b7many years [a long time; L\u202fmany days].

This is what the Lord had commanded Moses to do.", "21": "Now Joshua fought the Anakites [or Anakim; Num. 13:33] who lived in the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Hebron, Debir, Anab, Judah, and Israel, and he completely destroyed them and their towns.

He gave the land to Israel, \u00b7because he had promised it to them [L\u202fas an inheritance]. \u00b7Then Joshua divided the land among the tribes of Israel [L\u202f\u2026according to their tribal divisions], and \u00b7there was peace in the land [the land had rest from war]."}

", "3": "And now the Lord has done everything he \u00b7said [promised] he would do. This \u00b7disaster [evil; trouble] happened because you [C\u202fthe people of Judah] sinned against the Lord and did not \u00b7obey him [L\u202flisten to his voice].

If \u00b7you want to [L\u202fit is good in your eyes], come with me to Babylon, and I will \u00b7take good care of you [L\u202fset my eyes on you]. But if \u00b7you don't want to come [L\u202fit is wrong/evil/bad in your eyes to come with me to Babylon], then \u00b7don't [fine]. Look, the whole country is open to you.

Go and \u00b7live [stay] with Gedaliah among the people, or go anywhere \u00b7you want [L\u202fit is right in your eyes].\u201d Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some \u00b7food [provisions] and a \u00b7present [gift] and let him go.

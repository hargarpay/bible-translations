Suddenly, the Lord you are \u00b7looking for [seeking] will come to his Temple; the messenger of the \u00b7agreement [covenant; treaty], \u00b7whom you want [in whom you delight], will come.\u201d ", "2": "\u00b7No one can live through [L\u202fWho can endure\u2026?] \u00b7that time [the day of his coming]; \u00b7no one can survive [who can stand\u2026?] when he \u00b7comes [appears].

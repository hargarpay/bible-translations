{"1": "At that time Israel did not have a king [17:6]. And at that time the tribe of Dan was still \u00b7looking for a land [L\u202fseeking an inheritance] where they could live, a land of their own. The Danites had not yet \u00b7been given their own land [moved into their land; received their allotment] among the tribes of Israel. ", "2": "So, from their family groups, they chose five \u00b7soldiers [valiant men; L\u202fmen, sons of strength] from the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out and explore the land. They were told, \u201cGo, explore the land.\u201d They came to the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Ephraim, to Micah's house, where they spent the night. ", "3": "When they came near Micah's house, they recognized the \u00b7voice [or accent] of the young Levite [17:7]. So they stopped there and asked him, \u201cWho brought you here? What are you doing here? \u00b7Why are you here [What is your business here]?\u201d", "4": "He told them what Micah had done for him, saying, \u201cHe hired me. I am his priest.\u201d", "5": "They said to him, \u201cPlease ask God if \u00b7our journey [our mission; L\u202fthe way we are going] will be successful.\u201d", "6": "The priest said to them, \u201cGo in peace. The Lord \u00b7is pleased with [approves of; watches over] your journey.\u201d", "7": "So the five men left. When they came to the city of Laish, they saw that the people there lived in safety, \u00b7like [L\u202faccording to the custom of] the people of Sidon. They \u00b7thought they were safe [were quiet and secure/unsuspecting] and \u00b7had plenty of everything [or no ruler was humiliating them]. They lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else.", "8": "When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their \u00b7relatives [brothers] asked them, \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d", "9": "They answered, \u201cWe have seen the land, and it is very good. \u00b7We should attack [L\u202fArise, let us go up against] them. \u00b7Aren't you going to do something [Are you just going to sit there]? Don't \u00b7wait [hesitate; or be lazy]! Let's go and take that land! ", "10": "When you go, you will see there is \u00b7plenty of [a wide/spacious] land\u2014\u00b7plenty of everything [lacking nothing]! The people are not expecting an attack. Surely God has handed that land over to us!\u201d", "11": "So six hundred Danites left Zorah and Eshtaol \u00b7ready for [armed with weapons of] war. ", "12": "On their way they set up camp near the city of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is named Mahaneh Dan [C\u202f\u201cCamp of Dan\u201d] to this day. ", "13": "From there they traveled on to the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Ephraim. Then they came to Micah's house.", "14": "The five men who had explored the land around Laish said to their \u00b7relatives [L\u202fbrothers], \u201cDo you know in one of these houses there are a \u00b7holy vest [ephod; Ex. 28:6\u201314], household gods [17:5], an \u00b7idol, and a statue [or image overlaid with silver; 17:3]? \u00b7You know [or Decide now] what to do.\u201d ", "15": "So they stopped at the Levite's house, which was also Micah's house, and \u00b7greeted the Levite [or asked how he was doing]. ", "16": "The six hundred \u00b7Danites [L\u202fmen who were of the sons/descendants of Dan] stood at the entrance gate, wearing their weapons of war. ", "17": "The five spies went into the house and took the \u00b7idol [carved image], the \u00b7holy vest [ephod], the household idols, and the \u00b7statue [cast-metal image]. The priest and the six hundred men armed \u00b7for [L\u202fwith weapons of] war stood by the entrance gate.", "18": "When the spies went into Micah's house and took the [carved] image, the \u00b7holy vest [ephod], the household idols, and the \u00b7statue [cast-metal image], the priest asked them, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "19": "They answered, \u201cBe quiet! \u00b7Don't say a word [L\u202fPut your hand over your mouth]. Come with us and be our father [C\u202fmeaning an advisor or counselor; 17:10; Gen. 45:8] and priest. Is it better for you to be a priest for one man's house or for a tribe and \u00b7family group [clan] in Israel?\u201d ", "20": "This \u00b7made the priest happy [L\u202fpleased the heart of the priest]. So he took the \u00b7holy vest [ephod], the household idols [17:5], and the \u00b7idol [carved image] and went with the \u00b7Danites [people]. ", "21": "They left Micah's house, putting their little children, their animals, and everything they owned in front of them [C\u202ffor protection in case of attack; Gen. 33:2\u20133].", "22": "When they had gone a little way from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah \u00b7were called out [assembled] and caught up with them. ", "23": "The men with Micah shouted at the \u00b7Danites [L\u202fsons/descendants of Dan], who turned around and said to Micah, \u201cWhat's the matter with you? Why have you \u00b7been called out to [assembled for a] fight?\u201d", "24": "Micah answered, \u201cYou took my gods that I made and my priest. What do I have left? How can you ask me, 'What's the matter?'\u201d", "25": "The \u00b7Danites [L\u202fsons/descendants of Dan] answered, \u201c\u00b7You should not argue with [or Don't say another word to; L\u202fDon't let your voice be heard among] us. Some of our \u00b7angry [bitter] men might attack you, \u00b7killing you [and you will lose your life] and your \u00b7family [L\u202fhousehold].\u201d ", "26": "Then the \u00b7Danites [L\u202fsons/descendants of Dan] went on their way. Micah knew they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back home.", "27": "Then the Danites took what Micah had made and his priest and went on to Laish. They attacked those \u00b7peaceful [quiet] and \u00b7unsuspecting [secure] people and killed them with their swords and then burned the city. ", "28": "There was no one to \u00b7save [rescue; T\u202fdeliver] the people of Laish. They lived too far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else. Laish was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived there. ", "29": "They named the city Dan after their ancestor Dan, one of the sons of Israel; the city's original name was Laish.", "30": "The \u00b7people [L\u202fsons; descendants] of Dan set up the \u00b7idol [carved image] in the city of Dan. Jonathan son of Gershom, Moses' son, and his sons served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the \u00b7land was captured [captivity of the land; time of the exile]. ", "31": "The people of Dan set up the \u00b7idols [carved images] Micah had made as long as the \u00b7Holy Tent [Tabernacle; L\u202fHouse] of God was in Shiloh."}

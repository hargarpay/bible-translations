Since he was very tired, he was in a deep sleep. She hammered the tent peg through the side of Sisera's \u00b7head [temple; or mouth] and into the ground. And so Sisera died.", "22": "\u00b7At that very moment [T\u202fAnd behold] Barak came by Jael's tent, chasing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him and said, \u201cCome.

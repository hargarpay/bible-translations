{"1": "The men of Ephraim asked Gideon, \u201c\u00b7Why did you treat us this way [L\u202fWhat is this thing you have done to us]? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight against Midian?\u201d They argued \u00b7angrily [fiercely; greatly] with Gideon.", "2": "But he answered them, \u201c\u00b7I have not done as well as you! [L\u202fWhat have I done compared to you?] The \u00b7small part you did [L\u202fthe gleanings of Ephraim; C\u202fpicking up the leftover grapes after harvest] was better than \u00b7all that my people of Abiezer did [L\u202fthe vintage/grape harvest of Abiezer]. ", "3": "God \u00b7let you capture [L\u202fgave into your hand] Oreb and Zeeb, the \u00b7princes [leaders; commanders] of Midian. \u00b7How can I compare what I did with what you did [L\u202fWhat did I do in comparison]?\u201d When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon's answer, \u00b7they were not as angry anymore [they calmed down; L\u202ftheir spirit declined/subsided].", "4": "When Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan River, they were \u00b7tired [exhausted], but they chased the enemy across to the other side. ", "5": "Gideon said to the men of Succoth, \u201cPlease give my soldiers some loaves of bread because they are \u00b7very tired [exhausted]. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\u201d", "6": "But the \u00b7leaders [princes; officials] of Succoth said, \u201cWhy should we give your soldiers bread? \u00b7You haven't caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet [L\u202fAre the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your hand?].\u201d", "7": "Then Gideon said, \u201c\u00b7The Lord will surrender [L\u202fWhen the Lord surrenders] Zebah and Zalmunna to me. After that, I will \u00b7whip [beat; tear; L\u202fthresh] your skin with thorns and briers from the \u00b7desert [wilderness].\u201d", "8": "Gideon left Succoth and went up to the city of Peniel and \u00b7asked them for food [L\u202fspoke this to them]. But the people of Peniel gave him the same answer as the people of Succoth. ", "9": "So Gideon said to the men of Peniel, \u201c\u00b7After I win the victory [L\u202fWhen I return in peace], I will return and pull down this tower.\u201d", "10": "Zebah and Zalmunna and their army were in the city of Karkor. About fifteen thousand men were left of the armies of the \u00b7peoples [L\u202fsons] of the east.

", "12": "Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian, ran away, but Gideon chased and captured them and \u00b7frightened away [routed; caused to panic] their army.", "13": "Then Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the \u00b7Pass [or Ascent] of Heres. ", "14": "Gideon captured a young man from Succoth and \u00b7asked him some questions [interrogated him]. So the young man wrote down for Gideon the names of seventy-seven \u00b7officers [princes; leaders] and elders of Succoth.", "15": "When Gideon came to Succoth, he said to the people of that city, \u201c\u00b7Here are [L\u202fLook!; T\u202fBehold!] Zebah and Zalmunna. You \u00b7made fun of [taunted; insulted] me by saying, 'Why should we give bread to your tired men? \u00b7You have not caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet [L\u202fAre the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your hand?].'\u201d ", "16": "So Gideon took the elders of the city and \u00b7punished them [taught them a lesson] with thorns and briers from the \u00b7desert [wilderness].

Each one of them looked like \u00b7a prince [L\u202fsons of a king].\u201d", "19": "Gideon said, \u201cThose were my brothers, my mother's sons. As surely as the Lord lives, I would not kill you if you had spared them.\u201d ", "20": "Then Gideon said to Jether, his oldest son, \u201cKill them.\u201d But Jether was only a boy and was afraid, so he did not draw his sword.", "21": "Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, \u201cCome on. \u00b7Kill us [L\u202fDo it] yourself. As the saying goes, '\u00b7It takes a man to do a man's job [L\u202fAs is a man, so is his strength; C\u202fit was honorable to be killed by a great warrior, but humiliating to be killed by a boy].'\u201d So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the \u00b7decorations [L\u202fcrescent-shaped ornaments] off their camels' necks.", "22": "The people of Israel said to Gideon, \u201cYou \u00b7saved [rescued; T\u202fdelivered] us from the Midianites. Now, we want you and your son and your grandson to rule over us [C\u202fto establish a royal dynasty].\u201d", "23": "But Gideon told them, \u201cI will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord will be your ruler.\u201d ", "24": "He said, \u201cI want you to do this one thing for me. I want each of you to give me a gold earring from \u00b7the things you took in the fighting [L\u202fhis plunder].\u201d (The Ishmaelites [C\u202frelated to the Midianites, and sometimes identified with them; Gen. 37:25\u201328] wore gold earrings.)", "25": "They said, \u201cWe will \u00b7gladly [indeed] give you what you want.\u201d So they spread out a \u00b7coat [cloak; garment], and everyone threw down an earring from \u00b7what he had taken [his plunder]. ", "26": "The gold earrings weighed \u00b7about forty-three pounds [L\u202f1,700 shekels of gold]. This did not count the \u00b7decorations [L\u202fcrescent-shaped ornaments], \u00b7necklaces [pendants], and purple robes worn by the kings of Midian, nor the chains from the camels' necks. ", "27": "Gideon used the gold to make a \u00b7holy vest [ephod; C\u202fperhaps in imitation of the high priest and used to discern God's will; Ex. 29:2\u20135], which he put in his hometown of Ophrah. But all the Israelites \u00b7were unfaithful to God [L\u202fprostituted themselves] and worshiped it, so it became a \u00b7trap [snare; cause of sin] for Gideon and his family.", "28": "So Midian was \u00b7under the rule of [subdued before] \u00b7Israel [L\u202fthe sons/T\u202fchildren of Israel]; they did not \u00b7cause trouble anymore [L\u202fraise its head again].

", "32": "So Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age. He was buried in the tomb of Joash, his father, in Ophrah, \u00b7where the Abiezrites live [L\u202fof the Abiezrites].", "33": "As soon as Gideon died, the \u00b7people [L\u202fsons; T\u202fchildren] of Israel \u00b7were again unfaithful to God and followed [L\u202fprostituted themselves to] the Baals.

{"1": "One day Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there. He went in \u00b7to spend the night with her [L\u202fto her; C\u202fa euphemism for sexual relations]. ", "2": "When the people of Gaza heard, \u201cSamson has come here!\u201d they surrounded the place and \u00b7waited for him [set an ambush; lay in wait] near the city gate all night. They whispered to each other, \u201c\u00b7When dawn comes [At the morning light], we will kill Samson!\u201d", "3": "But Samson only stayed with the prostitute until midnight. Then he got up and took hold of the doors and the two posts of the city gate and tore them loose, along with the bar. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces the city of Hebron.", "4": "After this, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Valley of Sorek. ", "5": "The Philistine \u00b7rulers [lords] went to Delilah and said, \u201cFind out what makes Samson so strong. \u00b7Trick [Seduce; Entice] him into telling you how we can overpower him and tie him up and \u00b7capture [subdue] him. If you do this, each one of us will give you \u00b7twenty-eight pounds [L\u202feleven hundred pieces] of silver.\u201d", "6": "So Delilah said to Samson, \u201cTell me why you are so strong. How can someone tie you up and \u00b7capture [subdue] you?\u201d", "7": "Samson answered, \u201cSomeone would have to tie me up with seven \u00b7new [fresh] bowstrings that have not been dried. Then I would be as weak as any other man.\u201d", "8": "The Philistine \u00b7rulers [lords] brought Delilah seven \u00b7new [fresh] bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied Samson with them. ", "9": "Some men were \u00b7hiding [lying in wait] in \u00b7another [an inner; or their] room. Delilah said to him, \u201cSamson, the Philistines are here!\u201d But Samson broke the bowstrings like pieces of burned \u00b7string [flax]. So the Philistines did not find out the secret of Samson's strength.", "10": "Then Delilah said to Samson, \u201cYou \u00b7made a fool of [mocked; or deceived] me. You lied to me. Now tell me how someone can \u00b7tie you up [subdue you].\u201d", "11": "Samson said, \u201cThey would have to tie me with new ropes that have not been used before. Then I would become as weak as any other man.\u201d", "12": "So Delilah took new ropes and tied Samson. Some men were hiding in \u00b7another [an inner; or their] room. She called out to him, \u201cSamson, the Philistines are here!\u201d But he broke the ropes from his arms as easily as if they were threads.", "13": "Then Delilah said to Samson, \u201c\u00b7Again [L\u202fUntil now] you have \u00b7made a fool of [mocked; or deceived] me. You lied to me. Tell me how someone can tie you up.\u201d He said, \u201cUsing the loom, weave the seven braids of my hair into the \u00b7cloth [woven fabric; web], and tighten it with a pin. Then I will be as weak as any other man.\u201d While Samson slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the \u00b7cloth [woven fabric; web]. ", "14": "Then she fastened it with a pin. Again she said to him, \u201cSamson, the Philistines are here!\u201d Samson woke up and pulled out the pin and the loom with the \u00b7cloth [woven fabric; web].", "15": "Then Delilah said to him, \u201cHow can you say, 'I love you,' when \u00b7you don't even trust me [L\u202fyour heart is not with me]? This is the third time you have \u00b7made a fool of [mocked; or deceived] me. You haven't told me the secret of your great strength.\u201d ", "16": "She \u00b7kept bothering [nagged; pressed] Samson about his secret day after day until \u00b7he felt he was going to die [L\u202fhis soul was annoyed to death]!", "17": "So he told her \u00b7everything [L\u202fall his heart]. He said, \u201c\u00b7I have never had my hair cut [L\u202fA razor has never come upon my head], because I have been set apart to God as a Nazirite \u00b7since I was born [L\u202ffrom my mother's womb; 13:5, 7; Num. 6:1\u201312]. If someone shaved my head, I would lose my strength and be as weak as any other man.\u201d", "18": "When Delilah saw that he had told her \u00b7everything sincerely [L\u202fall his heart], she sent a message to the Philistine \u00b7rulers [lords]. She said, \u201cCome back one more time, because he has told me \u00b7everything [L\u202fall that is in his heart].\u201d So the Philistine rulers came back to Delilah and brought the silver \u00b7with them [L\u202fin their hands]. ", "19": "Delilah got Samson to sleep, lying in her lap. Then she called in a man to shave off the seven braids of Samson's hair. In this way she began to \u00b7make him weak [subdue him; make him vulnerable], and his strength left him.", "20": "Then she said, \u201cSamson, the Philistines are here!\u201d He woke up and thought, \u201cI'll leave as I did before and shake myself free.\u201d But he did not know that the Lord had left him.", "21": "Then the Philistines captured Samson and \u00b7tore [gouged] out his eyes. They took him down to Gaza, where they put bronze \u00b7chains [shackles] on him and made him grind grain in the prison. ", "22": "But his hair began to grow again after it was shaved off.", "23": "The Philistine \u00b7rulers [lords] gathered to celebrate and to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They said, \u201cOur god has handed Samson our enemy \u00b7over to us [into our hand].\u201d ", "24": "When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, \u201cThis man \u00b7destroyed [laid waste; ravaged] our country. He \u00b7killed many of us [L\u202fmultiplied our dead]! But our god handed over our enemy to us.\u201d", "25": "\u00b7While the people were enjoying the celebration [When they were in high spirits; L\u202fWhen their heart was good], they said, \u201cBring Samson out to \u00b7perform for [entertain; amuse] us.\u201d So they brought Samson from the prison, and he \u00b7performed for [entertained; amused] them. They made him stand between the pillars. ", "26": "Samson said to the \u00b7servant [youth; young man] holding his hand, \u201cLet me feel the pillars that hold up the \u00b7temple [house] so I can lean against them.\u201d ", "27": "Now the \u00b7temple [house] was full of men and women. All the Philistine \u00b7rulers [lords] were there, and about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching Samson perform. ", "28": "Then Samson prayed to the Lord, \u201c\u00b7Lord God [Sovereign Lord], remember me. God, please give me strength one more time so I \u00b7can pay these Philistines back [avenge the Philistines] for putting out my two eyes!\u201d ", "29": "Then Samson \u00b7turned to [grasped] the two center pillars \u00b7that supported the whole temple [L\u202fon which the house rested]. He braced himself between the two pillars, with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other. ", "30": "Samson said, \u201cLet me die with these Philistines!\u201d Then he pushed \u00b7as hard as he could [with all his strength], causing the temple to fall on the \u00b7rulers [lords] and all the people in it. So Samson killed more of the Philistines when he died than \u00b7when he was alive [during his lifetime].", "31": "Samson's brothers and \u00b7his whole family [L\u202fall the house of his father] went down to get his body. They brought him back and buried him in the tomb of Manoah, his father, between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol. Samson had \u00b7judged [led; 2:16] Israel for twenty years."}

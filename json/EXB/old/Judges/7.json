{"1": "Early in the morning Jerub-Baal (also called Gideon) and all his men set up their camp at the spring of Harod [C\u202fat the foot of Mount Gilboa]. The Midianites were camped north of them in the valley [C\u202fof Jezreel] at the bottom of the hill called Moreh. ", "2": "Then the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cYou have too many men \u00b7to defeat the Midianites [L\u202ffor me to give Midian into your hand]. I don't want the Israelites to brag \u00b7that they saved themselves [L\u202fsaying, \u201cMy own hand has saved/T\u202fdelivered me\u201d]. ", "3": "So now, \u00b7announce to [L\u202fcall into the ears of] the \u00b7people [nation; army], 'Anyone who is \u00b7afraid [L\u202ffearful and trembling] may leave Mount Gilead [C\u202fprobably another name for Gilboa] and go back home.'\u201d So twenty-two thousand men returned home, but ten thousand remained.", "4": "Then the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cThere are still too many men. Take the men down to the water, and I will \u00b7test [sort; sift out] them for you there. If I say, 'This man will go with you,' he will go. But if I say, 'That one will not go with you,' he will not go.\u201d", "5": "So Gideon led the men down to the water. There the Lord said to him, \u201cSeparate them into those who drink water by lapping it up like a dog [C\u202fwith cupped hand making a bowl] and those who \u00b7bend down [kneel] to drink [C\u202fwith faces in the water].\u201d ", "6": "There were three hundred men who used their hands to bring water to their mouths, \u00b7lapping it as a dog does [L\u202flapping]. All the rest \u00b7got down on their knees [kneeled] to drink.", "7": "Then the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cUsing the three hundred men who lapped the water, I will save you and \u00b7hand Midian over to you [L\u202fgive the Midianites into your hand]. Let all the others go home.\u201d ", "8": "So Gideon sent the rest of Israel \u00b7to their homes [L\u202feach to his tent]. But he kept three hundred men and took the \u00b7jars [provisions] and the trumpets of those who left. Now the camp of Midian was in the valley below Gideon. ", "9": "That night the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cGet up. Go down and attack the camp of the Midianites, because I will give \u00b7them to you [L\u202fit into your hands]. ", "10": "But if you are afraid to go down, take your servant Purah with you. ", "11": "When you come to the camp of Midian, you will hear what they are saying. Then \u00b7you will not be afraid [L\u202fyour hands will be strengthened] to attack the camp.\u201d So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the \u00b7edge [outposts; guardposts] of the enemy camp. ", "12": "The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the \u00b7peoples from [L\u202fsons of] the east were camped in that valley. \u00b7There were so many of them they seemed like locusts [L\u202f\u2026like locusts in numbers/greatness]. Their camels could not be counted because they were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore!", "13": "When Gideon came to the enemy camp, he heard a man telling his friend about a dream. He was saying, \u201c[L\u202fLook; T\u202fBehold] I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into the camp of Midian. It hit the tent so hard that the tent turned over and fell flat!\u201d", "14": "The man's friend said, \u201c\u00b7Your dream is about [L\u202fThis can be nothing except] the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel. God \u00b7will hand [L\u202fhas given into his hand] Midian and the whole army over to him!\u201d", "15": "When Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant, he \u00b7worshiped God [L\u202fbowed in worship]. Then Gideon went back to the camp of Israel and called out to them, \u201cGet up! The Lord has handed the army of Midian \u00b7over to you [L\u202finto your hand]!\u201d ", "16": "Gideon divided the three hundred men into three \u00b7groups [companies; divisions]. He gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a burning torch inside.", "17": "Gideon told the men, \u201cWatch me and do what I do. When I get to the edge of the camp, do what I do. ", "18": "Surround the enemy camp. When I and everyone with me blow our trumpets, you blow your trumpets, too. Then shout, 'For the Lord and for Gideon!'\u201d", "19": "So Gideon and the one hundred men with him came to the edge of the enemy camp at the beginning of the middle watch of the night, just after they had \u00b7changed guards [posted sentries; set the watch]. Then Gideon and his men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars. ", "20": "All three groups of Gideon's men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars. They held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands. Then they shouted, \u201cA sword for the Lord and for Gideon!\u201d ", "21": "Each of Gideon's men \u00b7stayed [stood] in his place around the camp, but the Midianites began shouting and running to escape.", "22": "When Gideon's three hundred men blew their trumpets, the Lord \u00b7made all the Midianites fight each other with their swords [L\u202fset the sword of a man against his companion]! The enemy army ran away to the city of Beth Shittah toward Zererah. They ran as far as the border of Abel Meholah, near the city of Tabbath [C\u202ftoward the southeast]. ", "23": "Then men of Israel from Naphtali, Asher, and all of Manasseh were called out to chase the Midianites. ", "24": "Gideon sent messengers through all the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Ephraim, saying, \u201cCome down and attack the Midianites. Take control of the \u00b7Jordan River [L\u202fwaters; C\u202fthe shallow crossing points] as far as Beth Barah before the Midianites can get to it.\u201d So they called out all the men of Ephraim, who took control of the \u00b7Jordan River [waters of the Jordan ahead of them; 3:28] as far as Beth Barah. ", "25": "The men of Ephraim captured two \u00b7princes [leaders; commanders] of Midian named Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb, and they continued chasing the Midianites. They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, \u00b7who was east of [or who was beside/across; L\u202ffrom beyond] the Jordan River."}

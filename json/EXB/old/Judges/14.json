{"1": "Samson went down to the city of Timnah where he saw \u00b7a Philistine woman [L\u202fone of the daughters of the Philistines]. ", "2": "When he returned home, he said to his father and mother, \u201cI saw \u00b7a Philistine woman [L\u202fone of the daughers of the Philistines] in Timnah. I want you to get her for me so I can marry her.\u201d", "3": "His father and mother answered, \u201c\u00b7Surely there is [L\u202fIs there not\u2026?] a woman from \u00b7Israel [L\u202fthe daughters of your brothers/relatives] you can marry. Do you have to marry a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines [Deut. 7:1\u20133]?\u201d But Samson said, \u201cGet that woman for me! She is \u00b7the one I want [L\u202fright in my eyes]!\u201d ", "4": "(Samson's parents did not know that \u00b7the Lord wanted this to happen [this was from the Lord] because he was looking for a \u00b7way [opportunity] to challenge the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at this time.)

They ate it, too, but Samson did not tell them he had \u00b7taken [scooped; scraped] the honey from the body of the dead lion [C\u202ftouching the carcass violated Samson's Nazirite vow; 13:5, 7; Num. 6:6].", "10": "Samson's father went down to see the Philistine woman.

Out of the strong comes something sweet.\u201d After three days, they had not \u00b7found the answer [solved the riddle].", "15": "On the fourth[a] day they said to Samson's wife, \u201cDid you invite us here to make us poor? \u00b7Trick [Entice; Coax] your husband into telling us the answer to the riddle.

They came to Samson and said, \u201cWhat is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?\u201d Then Samson said to them, \u201cIf you had not plowed with my \u00b7young cow [heifer; C\u202freferring to his wife], you would not have solved my riddle!\u201d", "19": "Then the Spirit of the Lord \u00b7entered Samson and gave him great power [empowered/came upon/rushed upon him; v. 6].

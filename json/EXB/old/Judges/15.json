{"1": "At the time of the wheat harvest [C\u202flate May or early June], Samson went to visit his wife, taking a young goat with him [C\u202fas a gift]. He said, \u201cI'm going to my wife's room,\u201d but her father would not let him go in.", "2": "He said to Samson, \u201cI thought you really hated your wife, so I gave her to your \u00b7best man [companion; 14:20]. \u00b7Her younger sister is [L\u202fIs not her younger sister\u2026?] more beautiful. Take her instead.\u201d", "3": "But Samson said to them, \u201cThis time \u00b7no one will blame me [I am justified/blameless/innocent] for hurting you Philistines!\u201d ", "4": "So Samson went out and caught three hundred \u00b7foxes [or jackals]. He took two at a time, tied their tails together, and then tied a torch to the tails of each pair of \u00b7foxes [or jackals]. ", "5": "After he lit the torches, he let the \u00b7foxes [or jackals] loose in the grainfields of the Philistines so that he burned up their standing grain, the \u00b7piles [heaps; shocks] of grain, their vineyards, and their olive trees.", "6": "The Philistines asked, \u201cWho did this?\u201d Someone told them, \u201cSamson, the son-in-law of the \u00b7man from Timnah [L\u202fTimnite], did because his father-in-law gave his wife to his \u00b7best man [companion].\u201d So the Philistines burned Samson's wife and her father to death. ", "7": "Then Samson said to the Philistines, \u201cSince you did this, I won't stop until I \u00b7pay you back [get revenge on you]!\u201d ", "8": "Samson \u00b7attacked the Philistines and killed many of them [L\u202fstruck them down calf on thigh with a great slaughter]. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.", "9": "The Philistines went up and camped in the land of Judah, \u00b7near a place named [spreading out near; or overrunning/raiding] Lehi. ", "10": "The men of Judah asked them, \u201cWhy have you come here to fight us?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe have come to make Samson our prisoner, to \u00b7pay him back for what he did to our people [L\u202fdo to him as he did to us].\u201d", "11": "Then three thousand men of Judah went to the \u00b7cave [cleft] in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, \u201cWhat have you done to us? Don't you know that the Philistines rule over us?\u201d Samson answered, \u201cI only \u00b7paid them back for [L\u202fdid to them] what they did to me.\u201d", "12": "Then they said to him, \u201cWe have come to \u00b7tie you up [bind you] and to hand you over to the Philistines.\u201d Samson said to them, \u201cPromise me you will not \u00b7hurt [attack; come against] me yourselves.\u201d", "13": "The men from Judah said, \u201c\u00b7We agree [L\u202fNo; C\u202fmeaning they wouldn't hurt him]. We will just \u00b7tie you up [bind you] and give you to the Philistines. We will not kill you.\u201d So they tied Samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock. ", "14": "When Samson came to the Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him, \u00b7shouting for joy [or with shouts of triumph; L\u202fshouting]. Then the Spirit of the Lord \u00b7entered Samson and gave him great power [came upon/rushed upon/empowered him; 14:19]. The ropes on him weakened like burned \u00b7strings [flax] and [L\u202fhis bonds] fell off his hands! ", "15": "Samson found the \u00b7jawbone [L\u202ffresh jawbone; C\u202fnot yet decayed] of a \u00b7dead donkey [T\u202fass], took it, and \u00b7killed [L\u202fstruck down] a thousand men with it!", "16": "Then Samson said, \u201cWith a donkey's jawbone I \u00b7made donkeys out of them [or have piled them in heaps]. With a donkey's jawbone I \u00b7killed [L\u202fstruck down] a thousand men!\u201d", "17": "When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone. So that place was named Ramath Lehi [C\u202fJawbone Hill].", "18": "Samson was very thirsty, so he cried out to the Lord, \u201cYou gave me, your servant, this great victory. Do I have to die of thirst now? Do I have to be captured by \u00b7people who are not circumcised [or these pagans; L\u202fthe uncircumcised]?\u201d ", "19": "Then God \u00b7opened up a hole in the ground [L\u202fsplit open the basin/hollow place] at Lehi, and water came out. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he \u00b7felt better [revived]. So he named that spring \u00b7Caller's Spring [or Spring of the One Who Cries Out; L\u202fEn Hakkore], which is still in Lehi.", "20": "Samson \u00b7judged [led] Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines."}

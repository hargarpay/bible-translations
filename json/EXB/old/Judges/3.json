", "6": "The Israelites \u00b7began to marry [L\u202ftook as wives] the daughters of those people, and they \u00b7allowed their daughters to marry [L\u202fgave their daughters to] the sons of those people. Israel also served their gods.", "7": "The \u00b7Israelites [L\u202fsons/T\u202fchildren of Israel] did \u00b7what the Lord said was wrong [L\u202fevil in the eyes/sight of the Lord]. They forgot about the Lord their God and served the \u00b7idols of Baal [L\u202fBaals; 2:11] and \u00b7Asherah [L\u202fAsherahs; C\u202fsacred trees or poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah; Deut. 16:21; Judg. 6:25].

Ehud said, \u201cI have a message from God for you.\u201d As the king stood up from his chair [C\u202fperhaps an act of reverence to receive the divine oracle], ", "21": "Ehud reached with his left hand and took out the sword that was tied to his right hip [C\u202fthe unusual location on the right allowed concealment and caught the king by surprise]. Then he stabbed the sword deep into the king's belly! ", "22": "Even the handle sank in, and \u00b7the blade came out his back [or his bowels discharged]. The king's fat covered the whole sword, so Ehud left the sword in Eglon.

He passed by the \u00b7statues [idols; images] and went to Seirah. ", "27": "When he reached the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Ephraim he blew the trumpet. The \u00b7people [L\u202fsons; T\u202fchildren] of Israel heard it and went down from the hills with Ehud leading them.", "28": "He said to them, \u201cFollow me! The Lord has \u00b7helped you to defeat [L\u202fgiven into your hand] your enemies, the Moabites.\u201d So Israel followed Ehud and captured the \u00b7crossings [fords] of the Jordan River \u00b7across from [or against] Moab.

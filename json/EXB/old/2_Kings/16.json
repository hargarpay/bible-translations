", "2": "Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he \u00b7ruled [reigned] sixteen years in Jerusalem. Unlike his \u00b7ancestor [father] David, he did not do \u00b7what the Lord his God said was right [right in the eyes/sight of the Lord his God]. ", "3": "Ahaz \u00b7did the same things the kings of Israel had done [L\u202fwalked in the way/path of the kings of Israel]. He even \u00b7made his son pass through fire [sacrificed his son in the fire; C\u202fa reference to human sacrifice]. He did the same \u00b7hateful sins [detestable/abominable practices] as the nations had done whom the Lord had \u00b7forced [driven] out of the land ahead of the \u00b7Israelites [L\u202fsons/T\u202fchildren of Israel].

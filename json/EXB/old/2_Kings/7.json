{"1": "Elisha said, \u201cListen to the Lord's word. \u00b7This is what the Lord says [T\u202fThus says the Lord]: 'About this time tomorrow \u00b7seven quarts [a measure/L\u202fseah; C\u202fthe exact quantity of a seah is debated] of \u00b7fine [choice] flour will be sold for \u00b7two-fifths of an ounce of silver [L\u202fa shekel], and \u00b7thirteen quarts [two measures/L\u202fseahs] of barley will be sold for \u00b7two-fifths of an ounce of silver [L\u202fa shekel; C\u202ffood would be readily available]. This will happen at the gate of Samaria [C\u202fthe common location of the marketplace].'\u201d", "2": "Then the officer \u00b7who was close to the king [L\u202fon whose arm the king was leaning] answered Elisha, \u201cEven if the Lord opened windows in the sky [C\u202fresulting in rain], that couldn't happen.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cYou will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it.\u201d", "3": "There were four men with \u00b7a skin disease [T\u202fleprosy; 5:1] at the entrance to the city gate. They said to each other, \u201cWhy \u00b7do [should] we sit here until we die? ", "4": "There is \u00b7no food [famine] in the city. So if we go into the city, we will die there. If we stay here, we will die. So let's go to the Aramean camp. If they \u00b7let us live [spare us], we will live. If they kill us, we die.\u201d", "5": "So they got up at \u00b7twilight [dusk] and went to the Aramean camp, but when they arrived at the edge of the camp, no one was there.

They had said to each other, \u201cThe king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!\u201d ", "7": "So they got up and ran away in the \u00b7twilight [dusk], \u00b7leaving [abandoning] their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp \u00b7standing [just as it was] and \u00b7ran [fled] for their lives.", "8": "When the \u00b7men with the skin disease [T\u202flepers; 5:1] came to the edge of the camp, they went into one of the tents and ate and drank. They carried silver, gold, and clothes out of the camp and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent. They carried things from this tent and hid them, also.

If we wait until the sun comes up, we'll be \u00b7discovered [punished; found guilty]. Let's go right now and tell the people in the king's \u00b7palace [L\u202fhousehold].\u201d", "10": "So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city.

Then we'll enter the city.'\u201d", "13": "One of his officers answered, \u201cLet some men take five of the horses that are still left in the city. These men are like all the Israelites who are left; they, like a multitude of Israelites who have already perished, are about to die. Let's send them to see what has happened.\u201d", "14": "So the men took two chariots with horses.

The road was full of clothes and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away as they had hurriedly left. So the messengers returned and told the king.

{"1": "Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was \u00b7honored [held in great favor] by his master and much respected, because the Lord used him to give victory to Aram. He was a \u00b7mighty and brave man [valiant soldier], but he had \u00b7a skin disease [T\u202fleprosy; C\u202frefers to a variety of skin diseases; Lev. 13:2].", "2": "The Arameans had gone out to raid the Israelites and had taken a little girl as a captive. This little girl served Naaman's wife. ", "3": "She said to her mistress, \u201cI wish my \u00b7master [lord] would meet the prophet who lives in Samaria. He would cure him of his \u00b7disease [T\u202fleprosy; 5:1].\u201d", "4": "Naaman went to the king and told him \u00b7what the girl from Israel had said [L\u202faccording to this and according to that the girl said]. ", "5": "The king of Aram said, \u201cGo ahead, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\u201d So Naaman left and took with him \u00b7about seven hundred fifty pounds [L\u202ften talents] of silver, as well as \u00b7one hundred fifty pounds [L\u202fsix thousand shekels] of gold and ten \u00b7changes of clothes [sets of festal/formal robes].

He said, \u201c\u00b7I'm not God! I can't kill and make alive again! [L\u202fAm I God, to give life or take it away?] Why does this man send someone with \u00b7a skin disease [T\u202fleprosy; 5:1] for me to heal? You can see that the king of Aram is trying to \u00b7start trouble [pick a fight/quarrel] with me.\u201d", "8": "When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent the king this message: \u201cWhy have you torn your clothes?

As surely as the Lord lives, I'll run after him and get something from him.\u201d ", "21": "So Gehazi \u00b7went after [pursued; ran after] Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got off the chariot to meet Gehazi. He asked, \u201cIs \u00b7everything all right [all well]?\u201d", "22": "Gehazi said, \u201cEverything is \u00b7all right [well]. My \u00b7master [lord] has sent me. He said, 'Two young men from the \u00b7groups [company; brotherhood; L\u202fsons] of prophets in the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Ephraim just came to me. Please give them \u00b7seventy-five pounds [L\u202fa talent] of silver and two changes of clothes.'\u201d", "23": "Naaman said, \u201cPlease take \u00b7one hundred fifty pounds [L\u202ftwo talents],\u201d and he urged Gehazi to take it. He tied \u00b7one hundred fifty pounds [L\u202ftwo talents] of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes. Then he gave them to two of his servants to carry for Gehazi. ", "24": "When they came to the hill, Gehazi took these things from Naaman's servants and \u00b7put [hid; stored] them in the house. Then he let Naaman's servants go, and they left.", "25": "When he came in and stood before his \u00b7master [lord], Elisha said to him, \u201cWhere have you been, Gehazi?\u201d \u201cI didn't go anywhere,\u201d he answered.", "26": "But Elisha said to him, \u201c\u00b7My spirit was [L\u202fDid not my heart/spirit go\u2026?] with you.

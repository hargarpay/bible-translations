{"1": "Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria [C\u202fthe city, not the region]. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria\u2014to the officers of the city[a] and elders\u2014and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab. Jehu said, ", "2": "\u201cYou have your \u00b7master's [lord's] sons with you, and you have chariots, horses, a \u00b7city with strong walls [fortified city], and weapons. When you get this letter, ", "3": "choose the best and most worthy person among your \u00b7master's [lord's] sons, and make him king. Then fight for your \u00b7master's [lord's] \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse].\u201d", "4": "But the officers and leaders of Jezreel were \u00b7frightened [utterly terrified]. They said, \u201cTwo kings could not \u00b7stand up to [resist] Jehu, so how can we?\u201d", "5": "The \u00b7palace manager [steward of the house], the city \u00b7governor [administrator], the \u00b7leaders [elders], and the guardians sent a message to Jehu. \u201cWe are your servants,\u201d they said. \u201cWe will do everything you tell us to do. We won't make any man king, so do whatever \u00b7you think is best [L\u202fis good in your eyes/sight].\u201d", "6": "Then Jehu wrote a second letter, saying, \u201cIf you are on my side and will obey me, cut off the heads of your \u00b7master's [lord's] sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.\u201d Now the seventy sons of the king's \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] were with the leading men of the city who were \u00b7their guardians [raising them]. ", "7": "When the leaders received the letter, they took the king's sons and \u00b7killed [slaughtered] all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. ", "8": "The messenger came to Jehu and told him, \u201cThey have brought the heads of the king's sons.\u201d Then Jehu said, \u201c\u00b7Lay [Pile] the heads in two \u00b7piles [heaps] at the city gate until morning.\u201d", "9": "In the morning, Jehu went out and stood before the people and said to them, \u201cYou are innocent. Look, I \u00b7made plans [conspired; plotted] against my \u00b7master [lord] and killed him. But who killed all these [C\u202fJehu might have been blaming the Samaritan officials, or perhaps was implying that God ordered the killing]? ", "10": "You should know that \u00b7everything [L\u202fnothing] the Lord said about Ahab's \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] will \u00b7come true [L\u202ffall to the ground/earth]. The Lord \u00b7has spoken [spoke his word] through his servant Elijah, and the Lord has done what he said.\u201d ", "11": "So Jehu killed everyone of Ahab's \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] in Jezreel who was still alive. He also killed all Ahab's \u00b7leading men [important officials], \u00b7close [personal] friends, and priests. \u00b7No one who had helped Ahab was left alive [He left no one to survive him].", "12": "Then Jehu left and went to Samaria by way of the road to Beth Eked of the Shepherds. ", "13": "There Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah. Jehu asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe are relatives of Ahaziah. We have come down to \u00b7get revenge for [or greet; visit] the families of the king and the king's mother.\u201d", "14": "Then Jehu said, \u201cTake them alive!\u201d So they captured Ahaziah's relatives alive and killed them at the \u00b7well [pit] near Beth Eked\u2014forty-two of them. Jehu \u00b7did not leave anyone alive [spared no one].", "15": "After Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab [Jer. 35], who was also on his way to meet Jehu. Jehu greeted him and said, \u201c\u00b7Are you as good a friend to me as I am to you [Are you as loyal to me as I am to you; L\u202fIs your heart right, as my heart is with your heart]?\u201d Jehonadab answered, \u201c\u00b7Yes, I am [L\u202fIt is].\u201d Jehu said, \u201cIf you are, then give me your hand.\u201d So Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him into the chariot. ", "16": "\u201cCome with me,\u201d Jehu said. \u201cYou can see \u00b7how strong my feelings are [my zeal/devotion] for the Lord.\u201d So Jehu had Jehonadab ride in his chariot.", "17": "When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all of Ahab's \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] in Samaria. He destroyed all those who were left, \u00b7just as the Lord had told Elijah it would happen [L\u202fin accordance with the word of the Lord spoken to Elijah].", "18": "Then Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, \u201cAhab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve Baal \u00b7much [greatly]. ", "19": "Now \u00b7call for me [summon; assemble] all Baal's prophets and priests and all the people who \u00b7worship [serve] Baal. Don't let anyone miss this meeting, because I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who is not there will not live.\u201d But Jehu was \u00b7tricking them [deceiving them; L\u202facting cunningly] so he could destroy \u00b7the worshipers of [those who served] Baal. ", "20": "He said, \u201cPrepare a \u00b7holy [sacred; solemn] meeting for Baal.\u201d So they \u00b7announced [proclaimed] the meeting. ", "21": "Then Jehu sent word through all Israel, and all \u00b7the worshipers of [who served] Baal came; not one stayed \u00b7home [behind]. They came into the \u00b7temple [L\u202fhouse] of Baal, and the \u00b7temple [L\u202fhouse] was filled from one side to the other.", "22": "Jehu said to the man who kept the robes, \u201cBring out \u00b7robes [garments; vestments] for all \u00b7the worshipers of [those who serve] Baal.\u201d After he brought out \u00b7robes [garments; vestments] for them, ", "23": "Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the \u00b7temple [L\u202fhouse] of Baal. Jehu said to \u00b7the worshipers of [those who served] Baal, \u201cLook around, and make sure there are no servants of the Lord with you. Be sure there are only \u00b7worshipers of [those who serve] Baal.\u201d ", "24": "Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had eighty men waiting outside. He had told them, \u201c\u00b7Don't let anyone escape. If you do, you [The one who allows any of these men who I have put in your hands to escape] must \u00b7pay with [exchange] your own life.\u201d", "25": "As soon as Jehu finished offering the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and the \u00b7captains [officers], \u201cGo in and kill \u00b7the worshipers of [those who serve] Baal. Don't let anyone \u00b7come out [escape].\u201d So the guards and \u00b7captains [officers] killed \u00b7the worshipers of [those who served] Baal with the sword and threw their bodies out. Then they went to the inner rooms of the \u00b7temple [L\u202fhouse of Baal] ", "26": "and brought out the \u00b7pillars [sacred poles/stone; C\u202fused in worship] of the \u00b7temple [L\u202fhouse] of Baal and burned them. ", "27": "They \u00b7tore down [smashed] the stone pillar of Baal, as well as the \u00b7temple [L\u202fhouse] of Baal. And they made it into a \u00b7sewage pit [public toilet; latrine], as it is today.", "28": "So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel, ", "29": "but he did not \u00b7stop doing [turn/depart from] the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had led Israel to sin by worshiping the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.", "30": "The Lord said to Jehu, \u201cYou have done well in \u00b7obeying what I said was right [L\u202fdoing what was right in my eyes/sight]. You have done to the \u00b7family [L\u202fhouse] of Ahab \u00b7as I wanted [L\u202fall that was in my heart/mind]. Because of this, your \u00b7descendants as far as your great-great-grandchildren [sons to the fourth generation] will \u00b7be kings [L\u202fsit on the throne] of Israel.\u201d ", "31": "But Jehu was not careful to follow the \u00b7teachings [law; L\u202ftorah] of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not \u00b7stop doing [turn/depart from] the same sins Jeroboam had done, by which he had led Israel to sin.", "32": "At that time the Lord began to \u00b7make Israel smaller [cut/trim off parts of Israel]. Hazael defeated the Israelites \u00b7in all the land [throughout the territory] of Israel, ", "33": "taking all the land east of the Jordan known as the land of Gilead. (It was the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh.) He took land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine through Gilead to Bashan.", "34": "The other things Jehu did\u2014everything he did and all his \u00b7victories [achievements; power]\u2014\u00b7are [L\u202fare they not\u2026?] recorded in the book of the \u00b7history [chronicles; annals; 1:18] of the kings of Israel. ", "35": "Jehu \u00b7died [L\u202flay down/T\u202fslept with his fathers/ancestors] and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz became king in his place. ", "36": "Jehu \u00b7was king [reigned] over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years."}

{"1": "When Jacob also went his way, the \u00b7angels [messengers] of God met him. ", "2": "When he saw them, he said, \u201cThis is the camp of God!\u201d So he named that place Mahanaim [C\u202fsounds like \u201ctwo camps\u201d in Hebrew; a city in the hill country of Gilead; Josh. 13:26, 30].", "3": "Jacob's brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the country of Edom [14:6]. Jacob sent messengers to Esau, ", "4": "telling them, \u201cGive this message to my \u00b7master [lord] Esau: 'This is what Jacob, your servant, says: I have \u00b7lived [sojourned; lived as an alien] with Laban and have \u00b7remained [or been detained] there until now. ", "5": "I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants. I send this message to \u00b7you [my master/lord] \u00b7and ask you to accept us [L\u202fto find grace in your eyes].' \u201d", "6": "The messengers returned to Jacob and said, \u201cWe went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him.\u201d", "7": "Then Jacob was very afraid and \u00b7worried [distressed]. He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two camps. ", "8": "Jacob thought, \u201cEsau might come and \u00b7destroy [strike; attack] one camp, but the \u00b7other camp can run away and [L\u202fthe camp that is left] \u00b7be saved [escape].\u201d", "9": "Then Jacob said, \u201cGod of my father Abraham! God of my father Isaac! Lord, \u00b7you told [did you not tell\u2026?] me to return to my country and my family. You said that you would treat me well. ", "10": "I am not worthy of the \u00b7kindness [loyalty; covenant love] and \u00b7continual goodness [faithfulness] you have shown \u00b7me [L\u202fyour servant]. The first time I traveled across the Jordan River, I had only my walking stick, but now I own enough to have two camps. ", "11": "Please \u00b7save [rescue; deliver] me from [L\u202fthe hand of] my brother Esau. I am afraid he will come and \u00b7kill [strike; attack] all of us, even the mothers with the children. ", "12": "You said to me, 'I will treat you well and will make your \u00b7children [L\u202fseed] as many as the sand of the seashore [22:17]. There will be too many to count.' \u201d", "13": "Jacob stayed there for the night and prepared \u00b7a gift [or tribute] for Esau from what he had with him: ", "14": "two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred \u00b7female sheep [ewes] and twenty \u00b7male sheep [rams], ", "15": "thirty female camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys. ", "16": "Jacob gave each separate flock of animals to one of his servants and said to them, \u201c\u00b7Go [Pass] ahead of me and keep some space between each herd.\u201d ", "17": "Jacob gave them their orders. To the servant with the first group of animals he said, \u201cMy brother Esau will come to you and ask, '\u00b7Whose servant are you [L\u202fTo whom do you belong]? Where are you going and whose \u00b7animals are these [L\u202fare these ahead of you]?' ", "18": "Then you will answer, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. He sent them as a \u00b7gift [or tribute] to you, my \u00b7master [lord] Esau, and he also is coming behind us.' \u201d", "19": "Jacob ordered the second servant, the third servant, and all the \u00b7other servants [L\u202fothers who followed the droves of animals] to do the same thing. He said, \u201cSay the same thing to Esau when you meet him. ", "20": "Say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.' \u201d Jacob thought, \u201cIf I send \u00b7these gifts [or this tribute] ahead of me, maybe \u00b7Esau will forgive me [L\u202fI will appease/propitiate him]. Then when I see \u00b7him [L\u202fhis face], perhaps he will accept me.\u201d ", "21": "So Jacob \u00b7sent [passed ahead of him] the \u00b7gifts [or tribute] to Esau, but he himself stayed that night in the camp.", "22": "During the night Jacob rose and crossed the Jabbok River [C\u202fa tributary of the Jordan about 15 miles north of the Dead Sea in the Transjordan] at the crossing, taking with him his two wives, his two slave girls, and his eleven sons. ", "23": "He sent his family and everything he had across the \u00b7river [wadi; ravine]. ", "24": "So Jacob was alone, and a man came and wrestled with him until \u00b7the sun came up [daybreak]. ", "25": "When the man saw he could not defeat Jacob, he struck Jacob's \u00b7hip [hip socket] and put it out of joint [L\u202fas he wrestled with him]. ", "26": "Then he said to Jacob, \u201cLet me go. \u00b7The sun is coming up [Daybreak is coming].\u201d But Jacob said, \u201cI will \u00b7let you go if you will [L\u202fnot let you go unless you] bless me.\u201d", "27": "The man said to him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he answered, \u201cJacob.\u201d", "28": "Then the man said, \u201cYour name will no longer be Jacob. Your name will now be Israel [C\u202fsounds like \u201che wrestled/fought/strove with God\u201d in Hebrew], because you have \u00b7wrestled [fought; strove] with God and with people, and you have \u00b7won [prevailed].\u201d", "29": "Then Jacob asked him, \u201cPlease tell me your name.\u201d But \u00b7the man [L\u202fhe] said, \u201cWhy do you ask my name?\u201d Then he blessed Jacob there.", "30": "So Jacob named that place Peniel [C\u202fsounds like \u201cface of God\u201d in Hebrew], saying, \u201cI have seen God face to face, but my life was \u00b7saved [spared].\u201d ", "31": "Then the sun rose as he was leaving that place, and Jacob was limping because of his \u00b7leg [hip]. ", "32": "So even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle that is on the hip joint of animals [C\u202fthe sciatic muscle], because Jacob was touched there."}

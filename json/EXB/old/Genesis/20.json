Abimelech king of Gerar heard this, so he sent some servants to take her. ", "3": "But one night God spoke to Abimelech in a dream and said, \u201cYou will die. The woman you took is married.\u201d", "4": "But Abimelech had not gone near Sarah, so he said, \u201cLord, would you \u00b7destroy [L\u202fkill; slay] an innocent nation?

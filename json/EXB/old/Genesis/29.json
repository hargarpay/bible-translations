", "2": "He looked and saw a well in the field and three flocks of sheep lying nearby, because they drank water from this well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well. ", "3": "When all the flocks would gather there, \u00b7the shepherds [L\u202fthey] would roll the stone away from the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place.", "4": "Jacob said to the shepherds there, \u201cMy brothers, where are you from?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe are from Haran [11:31].\u201d", "5": "Then Jacob asked, \u201cDo you know Laban, \u00b7grandson [descendant] of Nahor?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe know him.\u201d", "6": "Then Jacob asked, \u201cHow is he?\u201d They answered, \u201cHe is well.

Then we will roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep.\u201d", "9": "While \u00b7Jacob [L\u202fhe] was talking with \u00b7the shepherds [L\u202fthem], Rachel came with her father's sheep, because \u00b7it was her job to care for the sheep [L\u202fshe was a shepherdess].

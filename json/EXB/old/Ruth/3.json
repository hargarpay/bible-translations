{"1": "Then Naomi, Ruth's mother-in-law, said to her, \u201cMy daughter, \u00b7I must [L\u202fShould I not\u2026?] find \u00b7a suitable home [L\u202frest; C\u202fa husband and a home to provide security] for you, \u00b7one that will be good for you [or so you will be secure; L\u202fthat it will go/be well for you]. ", "2": "Now Boaz, whose \u00b7young women [female servants] you worked with, is our close relative [C\u202fand so an appropriate guardian/kinsman-redeemer to marry Ruth; 2:20]. [L\u202fLook; T\u202fBehold] Tonight he will be \u00b7working [L\u202fwinnowing barley] at the threshing floor. ", "3": "Wash yourself, put on perfume, \u00b7change your clothes [or get dressed up; or put on your cloak], and go down to the threshing floor. But don't let him know you're there until he has finished \u00b7his dinner [L\u202feating and drinking]. ", "4": "Watch him so you will know where he lies down to sleep. When he lies down, go and \u00b7lift the cover off [uncover] his \u00b7feet [or legs; C\u202fevidently an appeal for marriage] and lie down. He will tell you what you should do.\u201d", "5": "Then Ruth answered, \u201cI will do everything you say.\u201d", "6": "So Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did all her mother-in-law \u00b7told [instructed; commanded] her to do. ", "7": "After \u00b7his evening meal [L\u202fhe had eaten and drunk], \u00b7Boaz felt good [L\u202fhis heart was good/pleased] and went to sleep lying \u00b7beside [at the end of] the pile of grain. Ruth went to him quietly and lifted the cover from his feet and lay down.", "8": "About midnight Boaz \u00b7was startled [or shuddered] and rolled over. [L\u202fAnd look/T\u202fbehold] There was a woman lying near his feet! ", "9": "Boaz asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d She said, \u201cI am Ruth, your servant girl. Spread \u00b7your cover [or the corner of your garment; or your wings; 2:12] over me [C\u202fa request for the provision and protection of marriage], because you are a \u00b7relative who is supposed to take care of me [guardian; kinsman-redeemer; 2:20].\u201d", "10": "Then Boaz said, \u201cThe Lord bless you, my daughter. This [second; L\u202flast] act of kindness is greater than the \u00b7kindness you showed to Naomi in the beginning [L\u202ffirst]. You didn't look for a young man to marry, either rich or poor. ", "11": "Now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do everything you ask, because all the people in our town know you are a \u00b7good [worthy; noble] woman [Prov. 31:10]. ", "12": "It is true that I am a \u00b7relative who is to take care of you [guardian; kinsmen-redeemer; 2:20], but you have a closer relative than I. ", "13": "Stay here tonight, and in the morning we will see if he will \u00b7take care of [be a guardian for; redeem] you. If he decides to \u00b7take care of [be a guardian for; redeem] you, that is fine. But if he refuses, I will \u00b7take care of [be a guardian for; redeem] you myself, as surely as the Lord lives. So \u00b7stay here [L\u202flie down] until morning.\u201d", "14": "So Ruth stayed near his feet until morning but got up while it was still too dark to recognize anyone. Boaz thought, \u201cPeople in town must not know that the woman came here to the threshing floor.\u201d ", "15": "So Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cBring me your \u00b7shawl [cloak] and hold it open.\u201d So Ruth held her \u00b7shawl [cloak] open, and Boaz poured six portions of barley into it. Boaz then put it on \u00b7her head [or her back; L\u202fher] and went[a] back to the city.", "16": "When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, \u201cHow did \u00b7you do [things go], my daughter?\u201d Ruth told Naomi everything that \u00b7Boaz [L\u202fthe man] did for her. ", "17": "She said, \u201cBoaz gave me these six portions of barley, saying, 'You must not go home \u00b7without a gift for [L\u202fempty to] your mother-in-law.'\u201d", "18": "Naomi answered, \u201c\u00b7Wait [Stay here; or Be patient], my daughter, until you see what happens. \u00b7Boaz [L\u202fThe man] will not rest until he has finished doing what he should do today.\u201d"}

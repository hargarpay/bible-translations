But if you don't want to buy it, tell me, because you are the \u00b7only one [or first in line] who can buy it, and I am next after you.\u201d The close relative answered, \u201cI will \u00b7buy back the land [redeem it].\u201d", "5": "Then Boaz explained, \u201cWhen you \u00b7buy [acquire] the land from [L\u202fthe hand of] Naomi, you must also \u00b7marry [acquire] Ruth, the Moabite, the dead man's wife. \u00b7That way, the land will stay in the dead man's name [L\u202f\u2026to raise up a name for the dead man upon his inheritance].\u201d", "6": "The \u00b7close relative [guardian; kinsman-redeemer] answered, \u201cI can't \u00b7buy back the land [redeem it].

May the Lord make this woman, who is coming into your home, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the \u00b7people [L\u202fhouse] of Israel [C\u202fthe twelve sons of Israel were born to Leah, Rachel and their servant girls; Gen. 29:31\u201430:24].

They should be taken to the \u00b7women's quarters [harem; L\u202fhouse of the women] and put under the \u00b7care [custody; authority] of Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the \u00b7women [harem].

Jair was the son of Shimei, the son of Kish [C\u202fthese are relatives of Saul, showing that Mordecai was his descendant; 1 Sam. 9:1\u20133; 2 Sam. 16:5]. Mordecai was from the tribe of Benjamin, ", "6": "which had been taken \u00b7captive [into exile] from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

Hadassah was also called Esther, and she \u00b7had a very pretty figure and face [L\u202fwas beautiful of form]. Mordecai had \u00b7adopted [raised; taken] her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.", "8": "When the king's command and \u00b7order [decree; edict] had been \u00b7heard [proclaimed], many \u00b7girls [young women] had been brought to the \u00b7palace [citadel; fortress; 1:2] in Susa and put under the \u00b7care [custody; authority] of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the king's \u00b7palace [L\u202fhouse] and put under the \u00b7care [custody; authority] of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.

He gave her seven \u00b7servant girls [maids; attendants] chosen from the king's \u00b7palace [L\u202fhouse]. Then he \u00b7moved [transferred] her and her \u00b7seven servant girls [maids; attendants] to the best part of the \u00b7women's quarters [harem; L\u202fhouse of the women].", "10": "Esther did not tell anyone about her \u00b7family [people; nationality] or \u00b7who her people were [her kindred/lineage], because Mordecai had \u00b7told [instructed] her not to.

For six months she was treated with oil \u00b7and [or of] myrrh and for six months with \u00b7perfumes [spices] and \u00b7cosmetics [ointments]. ", "13": "Then she \u00b7was ready to go [would go in this way] to the king. Anything she \u00b7asked for [desired] was given to her to take with her from the \u00b7women's quarters [harem; L\u202fhouse of the women] to the king's \u00b7palace [L\u202fhouse].

He announced a holiday for all the \u00b7empire [L\u202fprovinces] and \u00b7had the government give away gifts [gave gifts with royal liberality/generosity].", "19": "Now Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate [C\u202fan indication he was likely a government official] when the girls were \u00b7gathered the second time [or transferred to the second harem; or gathered again].

While Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, they became angry and \u00b7began to make plans [plotted; conspired] to \u00b7kill [assassinate; L\u202fsend a hand against] King \u00b7Xerxes [L\u202fAhasuerus].

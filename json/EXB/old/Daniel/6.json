{"1": "\u00b7Darius thought it would be a good idea [L\u202fIt pleased Darius; 5:30] to \u00b7choose [L\u202fset over the kingdom] one hundred twenty \u00b7governors [L\u202fsatraps] who would \u00b7rule his [L\u202fbe over the] kingdom. ", "2": "He chose three men as \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads] over those \u00b7governors [L\u202fsatraps], and Daniel was one of the \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads]. The \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads] were to ensure that the \u00b7governors did not try to cheat the king [L\u202fking would not be troubled/disturbed]. ", "3": "Daniel \u00b7showed that he could do the work better than [distinguished himself above] the other \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads] and \u00b7governors [L\u202fsatraps] because an \u00b7excellent [extraordinary] spirit was in him, so the king planned to put Daniel in charge of the whole kingdom. ", "4": "Because of this, the other \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads] and \u00b7governors [L\u202fsatraps] tried to find reasons to accuse Daniel \u00b7about his work in the government [L\u202fin regard to the kingdom]. But they could not find anything \u00b7wrong with him or any reason to accuse him [in regard to complaint or corruption], because he was trustworthy and not lazy or \u00b7dishonest [corrupt]. ", "5": "Finally these men said, \u201cWe will never find any reason to accuse Daniel unless it is about the law of his God.\u201d", "6": "So the \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads] and \u00b7governors [L\u202fsatraps] \u00b7went as a group to [or conspired against] the king and said: \u201cKing Darius, live forever! ", "7": "The \u00b7supervisors [presidents; heads], \u00b7assistant governors [prefects], \u00b7governors [L\u202fsatraps], \u00b7the people who advise you [counselors], and the \u00b7captains of the soldiers [governors] have \u00b7all agreed [taken counsel] that you should \u00b7make a new law [issue a decree] \u00b7for everyone to obey [and enforce an edict]: For the next thirty days no one should pray to any god or human except to you, O king. Anyone who doesn't obey will be thrown into the lions' den. ", "8": "Now, O king, \u00b7make the law [enforce the edict] and sign \u00b7your name to it [L\u202fthe document] so that it cannot be changed, because then it will be a law of the Medes and Persians and cannot be canceled.\u201d ", "9": "So King Darius signed the \u00b7law [L\u202fdocument and edict].", "10": "Even though Daniel knew that the \u00b7new law [document] had been \u00b7written [signed], he went to pray in an upstairs room in his house, which had windows that opened toward Jerusalem. Three times each day Daniel would kneel down to pray and \u00b7thank [praise] God, just as he always had done [1 Kin. 8:35\u201336; Ps. 55:17].", "11": "Then those men \u00b7went as a group [conspired] and found Daniel praying and \u00b7asking God for help [seeking mercy from God]. ", "12": "So they \u00b7went to [approached] the king and talked to him about the \u00b7law he had made [edict]. They said, \u201cDidn't you sign a \u00b7law [edict] that says no one may pray to any god or human except you, O king? Doesn't it say that anyone who disobeys during the next thirty days will be thrown into the lions' den?\u201d The king answered, \u201cYes, \u00b7that is the law [L\u202fthe thing is certain], and the laws of the Medes and Persians cannot be canceled.\u201d", "13": "Then they said to the king, \u201cDaniel, one of the \u00b7captives [exiles] from Judah, \u00b7is not paying attention to [disregards] you, O\u00a0king, or to the \u00b7law [edict] you signed. Daniel still prays three times every day.\u201d ", "14": "The king \u00b7became very upset [was displeased] when he heard \u00b7this [L\u202fthe word]. He \u00b7wanted [L\u202fset his mind] to \u00b7save [rescue] Daniel, and he worked hard until sunset trying to think of a way to \u00b7save [rescue] him.", "15": "Then those men \u00b7went as a group to [or conspired against] the king. They said, \u201c\u00b7Remember [Know], O king, the law of the Medes and Persians says that no \u00b7law [edict] or command given by the king can be changed.\u201d", "16": "So King Darius gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, \u201cMay the God you \u00b7serve [fear; Prov. 1:7] all the time \u00b7save [rescue] you!\u201d ", "17": "A stone was brought and placed over the \u00b7opening [L\u202fmouth] of the lions' den. Then the king used his signet ring and the rings of his \u00b7royal [noble; important] officers to put special seals on the rock [C\u202frings with personal identification symbols that could be pressed into soft clay]. This ensured that \u00b7no one would move the rock and bring Daniel out [L\u202fnothing would be changed with Daniel]. ", "18": "Then King Darius went back to his palace. He \u00b7did not eat [fasted] that night, \u00b7he did not have any entertainment [L\u202fnothing was; C\u202freferring to food and/or women] brought to him, and he could not sleep.", "19": "The next morning King Darius got up at dawn and \u00b7hurried [or in agitation went] to the lions' den. ", "20": "As he came near the den, he was worried. He called out to Daniel, \u201cDaniel, servant of the living God! Has your God that you always \u00b7worship [fear; serve; Prov. 1:7] been able to \u00b7save [rescue] you from the lions?\u201d", "21": "Daniel answered, \u201cO king, live forever! ", "22": "My God sent his \u00b7angel [or messenger] to close the lions' mouths [Heb. 11:33]. They have not \u00b7hurt [injured] me, because my God knows I am \u00b7innocent [blameless]. I never did anything \u00b7wrong to [to injure] you, O king.\u201d", "23": "King Darius was very happy and told his servants to lift Daniel out of the lions' den. So they lifted him out and did not find any injury on him, because Daniel had trusted in his God.", "24": "Then the king commanded that the men who had \u00b7accused [conspired against; L\u202featen pieces of] Daniel be brought to the lions' den. They, their wives, and their children were thrown into the den. The lions \u00b7grabbed [overpowered] them before they \u00b7hit [reached] the floor of the den and \u00b7crushed their bones [or tore their bodies into pieces; Prov. 28:10].", "25": "Then King Darius wrote a letter to all people and all nations, \u00b7to those who spoke every language [L\u202fand tongues] in the world: I wish you great \u00b7peace and wealth [prosperity].", "26": "I \u00b7am making a new law [L\u202fset a decree] for people in every part of my \u00b7kingdom [kingly dominion]. All of you must \u00b7fear [tremble] and \u00b7respect [fear] the God of Daniel. For he is the living God; he \u00b7lives [endures] forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his \u00b7rule [sovereignty] will never end.", "27": "God rescues and \u00b7saves [delivers] people and does \u00b7mighty miracles [signs and wonders] in heaven and on earth. He is the one who \u00b7saved [rescued] Daniel from the \u00b7power [L\u202fhand] of the lions.", "28": "So Daniel was \u00b7successful [prosperous] during the time Darius was king \u00b7and [or even] when Cyrus the Persian was king [C\u202fmay be two different names for the same king]."}

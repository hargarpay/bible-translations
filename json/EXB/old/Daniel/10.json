{"1": "During Cyrus' third year as king of Persia [C\u202f536 bc], a \u00b7message [L\u202fword] was revealed to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar [1:7]. The \u00b7message [L\u202fword] was true and concerned a great \u00b7war [conflict]. He understood the \u00b7message [L\u202fword] and understood the vision.", "2": "\u00b7At that time [L\u202fIn those days] I, Daniel, had been \u00b7very sad [mourning] for three \u00b7weeks [sevens of days]. ", "3": "I did not eat any \u00b7fancy [rich] food or meat, or drink any wine, or \u00b7use any perfumed oil [anoint myself] \u00b7for three weeks [L\u202funtil the completion of the three weeks/sevens of days].", "4": "On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was standing beside the great Tigris River [C\u202falong with the Euphrates, one of the major rivers in Babylon, present-day Iraq]. ", "5": "I \u00b7looked up [L\u202flifted up my eyes] and saw a man dressed in linen clothes with a belt of gold of Uphaz [C\u202fsignifying high quality] wrapped around his waist. ", "6": "His body was like \u00b7shiny yellow quartz [beryl; or chrysolite]. His face was like lightning [C\u202fbright], and his eyes were like \u00b7fire [L\u202fflaming torches]. His arms and legs were \u00b7shiny [gleaming] like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like the roar of a crowd [Ezek. 1:7, 13, 23, 24, 27; 9:2; Rev. 1:15].", "7": "I, Daniel, was the only person who saw the vision. The men with me did not see it, because \u00b7they were so frightened [L\u202fgreat trembling fell on them] that they \u00b7ran away [fled] and hid. ", "8": "So I was left alone, watching this great vision. \u00b7I lost my strength [L\u202fNo strength was left in me], my \u00b7face turned white like a dead person [L\u202fsplendor was spoiled], and I \u00b7was helpless [L\u202fretained no strength]. ", "9": "Then I heard the \u00b7man in the vision speaking [L\u202fsound of his words]. As I \u00b7listened [L\u202fheard the sound of his words], I fell into a \u00b7deep sleep [trance] with my face on the ground.", "10": "Then a hand touched me and set me on my hands and knees. I was so afraid that I was \u00b7shaking [trembling]. ", "11": "\u00b7The man in the vision [L\u202fHe] said to me, \u201cDaniel, \u00b7God loves you very much [L\u202fyou are favored/coveted/desired]. Think carefully about the words I will speak to you, and stand up, because I have been sent to you.\u201d When he said this, I stood up, but I was still \u00b7shaking [trembling].", "12": "Then the man said to me, \u201cDaniel, do not be afraid. \u00b7Some time ago [L\u202fFrom the first day] you \u00b7decided [L\u202fgave your heart/mind] to get understanding and to humble yourself before your God. \u00b7Since that time God has listened to you [L\u202f\u2026your words have been heard], and I have come because of your \u00b7prayers [L\u202fwords].

Then Michael, one of the most important \u00b7angels [L\u202fprinces], came to help me, because I had been left there with the king of Persia. ", "14": "Now I have come to \u00b7explain to you [help you understand] what will happen to your people, because the vision is about a time in the future.\u201d", "15": "While he was speaking to me, I \u00b7bowed facedown [L\u202fplaced my face on the ground] and could not speak. ", "16": "Then one \u00b7who looked like a man [L\u202faccording to the likeness of a son of man] touched my lips, so I opened my mouth and started to speak. I said to the one standing in front of me, \u201cMaster, \u00b7I am upset and afraid [L\u202fpangs/anguish/pain came over me] because of what I saw in the vision. I \u00b7feel helpless [L\u202fcould not retain strength].

", "19": "He said, \u201cDaniel, don't be afraid. \u00b7God loves you very much [L\u202fYou are favored/coveted/desired]. Peace be with you. Be strong now; be courageous.\u201d When he spoke to me, I became stronger and said, \u201cMaster, speak, since you have given me strength.\u201d", "20": "Then he said, \u201cDaniel, do you know why I have come to you? Soon I must go back to fight against the prince of Persia [v. 13]. When I go, the prince of \u00b7Greece [L\u202fJavan] will come, ", "21": "but I must first tell you what is \u00b7written [inscribed] in the \u00b7Book of Truth [or dependable writings]. No one stands with me against these enemies except Michael, \u00b7the angel ruling over your people [L\u202fyour prince]."}

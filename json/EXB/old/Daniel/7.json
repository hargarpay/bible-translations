{"1": "In Belshazzar's first year as king of Babylon [C\u202fperhaps 550 bc], Daniel had a dream. He saw visions [L\u202fin his head] as he was lying on his bed, and he wrote \u00b7down what he had dreamed [L\u202fthe beginning of the words/matter].", "2": "Daniel said: \u201cI saw my vision at night. In the vision the \u00b7wind was blowing from all four directions, which made the sea very rough [L\u202ffour winds of heaven stirred up the great sea; C\u202fa picture of chaos]. ", "3": "I saw four huge \u00b7animals [beasts] come up from the sea, and each \u00b7animal [beast] was different from the others.", "4": "\u201cThe first \u00b7animal [beast] looked like a lion, but had wings like an eagle. I watched this \u00b7animal [beast] until its wings were torn off. It was lifted from the ground so that it stood up on two feet like a human, and it was given the \u00b7mind [heart] of a human [C\u202fperhaps representing Babylon].", "5": "\u201cThen I saw a \u00b7second [L\u202fanother] \u00b7animal [beast] before me that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides and had three \u00b7ribs [or tusks] in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat \u00b7all the meat you want [much flesh; many bodies; C\u202fperhaps representing the Medes or the Medes and Persians]!'", "6": "\u201cAfter that, I looked, and there before me was another \u00b7animal [beast]. This \u00b7animal [beast] looked like a leopard with four wings on its back that looked like a bird's wings. This \u00b7animal [beast] had four heads and was given \u00b7power to rule [authority; C\u202fperhaps representing the Persians or the Greeks].", "7": "\u201cAfter that, in my vision at night I saw in front of me a fourth \u00b7animal [beast] that was \u00b7cruel [fearsome], \u00b7terrible [terrifying], and very strong [C\u202fperhaps the Greeks or Romans]. It had large iron teeth. It crushed and ate what it killed, and then it \u00b7walked on [L\u202fstamped with its feet] whatever was left. This fourth \u00b7animal [beast] was different from any \u00b7animal [beast] I had seen before, and it had ten horns [C\u202frepresenting strength and power].", "8": "\u201cWhile I was \u00b7thinking about [reflecting on] the horns, another horn grew up among them. It was a little horn with eyes like a human's eyes. It also had a mouth, and the mouth was bragging. The little horn \u00b7pulled out [uprooted] three of the other horns.", "9": "\u201cAs I looked, thrones were put in their places, and \u00b7God, the Eternal One, [L\u202fthe Ancient of Days] sat on his throne. His clothes were white like snow, and the hair on his head was like wool [C\u202fwhite]. His throne was made from fire, and the wheels of his throne were blazing with fire.", "10": "A river of fire was flowing from in front of him. \u00b7Many [L\u202fA thousand] thousands of angels were serving him, and \u00b7millions [L\u202ften thousand times ten thousand; C\u202fangels] stood before him. Court \u00b7was ready to begin [sat in judgment], and the books were opened.", "11": "\u201cI kept on looking because the horn [C\u202fthe little one] was bragging. I kept watching until finally the \u00b7animal [beast; C\u202fthe fourth] was killed. Its body was destroyed, and it was \u00b7thrown [given over] into the burning fire. ", "12": "(The \u00b7power and rule [authority; dominion; sovereignty] of the \u00b7other animals [rest of the beasts] had been taken from them, but they were permitted to live for a \u00b7certain period of time [L\u202fseason and a time].)", "13": "\u201cIn my vision at night I saw in front of me someone \u00b7who looked like a human being [L\u202flike a son of man] coming on the clouds in the \u00b7sky [heavens; C\u202fGod's heavenly chariot; Ps. 18:10\u201319; 68:4; 104:3; Is. 19:1; Luke 21:27; Rev. 1:7]. He came near \u00b7God, who has been alive forever [L\u202fthe Ancient of Days], and he was \u00b7led to God [presented to him].

The visions that went through my \u00b7mind [L\u202fhead] \u00b7frightened [terrified] me. ", "16": "I came near one of those standing there [C\u202fan angel, perhaps Gabriel who interprets visions; 8:16; 9:21] and asked \u00b7what all this meant [the truth of all this]. \u201cSo he told me and explained to me \u00b7what these things meant [L\u202fthe interpretation of the matter]: ", "17": "'The four great \u00b7animals [beasts] are four \u00b7kingdoms [or kings] that will come from the earth [vv. 4\u20137].

It was very \u00b7terrible [fearsome] and had iron teeth and bronze claws. It was the \u00b7animal [beast] that crushed and ate what it killed and then \u00b7walked on [stamped with its feet] whatever was left [v. 7]. ", "20": "I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn [C\u202fthe little one] that grew there. It had \u00b7pulled out [uprooted] three of the other ten horns and looked greater than the others. It had eyes and a mouth that kept bragging. ", "21": "As I watched, the horn [C\u202fthe little one] began making war against \u00b7God's holy people [L\u202fthe holy ones; v. 18] and was defeating them ", "22": "until \u00b7God, who has been alive forever, [L\u202fthe Ancient of Days; v. 9] came.

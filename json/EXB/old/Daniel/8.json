{"1": "\u00b7During [In] the third year of King Belshazzar's rule [C\u202fperhaps 547 bc], I, Daniel, saw another vision, \u00b7which was like the first one [L\u202fafter the one that appeared to me in the beginning/previously; 7:1]. ", "2": "In this vision I saw myself in the \u00b7capital city [or fortress city] of Susa, in the \u00b7area [province] of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai \u00b7Canal [or Gate] ", "3": "when I \u00b7looked up and [L\u202flifted my eyes I] saw a \u00b7male sheep [ram] standing beside the \u00b7canal [or gate]. It had two long horns, but one horn was longer and \u00b7newer than the other [L\u202fcame up second]. ", "4": "I watched the \u00b7sheep [ram] charge to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stand before him, and none could \u00b7save [protect] another animal from his \u00b7power [L\u202fhand]. He did whatever he \u00b7wanted [pleased] and became very \u00b7powerful [great; strong].", "5": "While I was \u00b7watching this [or reflecting; pondering], I saw a male goat come from the west. This goat had \u00b7one large horn between his eyes that was easy to see [L\u202fa horn of vision; or a conspicuous horn between its eyes]. He crossed over the whole earth without touching the ground [C\u202fbecause of its speed].", "6": "\u00b7In his anger [or With angry power] the goat \u00b7charged [L\u202fcame up to] the \u00b7sheep [ram] with the two horns that I had seen standing by the \u00b7canal [or gate]. ", "7": "I watched the angry goat \u00b7attack [approach] the \u00b7sheep [ram] and break the \u00b7sheep's [ram's] two horns. The \u00b7sheep [ram] \u00b7was not strong enough to stop him [L\u202fdid not have the power/strength to stand before him]. The goat \u00b7knocked [threw] the \u00b7sheep [ram] to the ground and then \u00b7walked all over him [trampled him]. No one was able to \u00b7save [protect] the \u00b7sheep [ram] from \u00b7the goat [its power/L\u202fhand], ", "8": "so the male goat became very \u00b7great [powerful; strong]. But when he was strong, his \u00b7big [or conspicuous] horn broke off and four horns grew in place of the one big horn. Those four horns \u00b7pointed in four different directions [L\u202fwere toward the four winds of heaven] and were \u00b7easy to see [conspicuous].", "9": "Then \u00b7a little horn grew from one of those four horns [L\u202ffrom one of them came out another horn, a little one; 7:8], and it became very \u00b7big [great]. It grew to the south, the east, and toward the beautiful land [C\u202fJudah; Ezek. 20:6, 15]. ", "10": "That \u00b7little horn [L\u202fit] grew \u00b7until it reached to the sky [L\u202fto the hosts of heaven; C\u202fthe angels and the stars]. It even threw some of the \u00b7army of heaven [L\u202fhosts and the stars] to the ground and \u00b7walked on [trampled] them! ", "11": "\u00b7That little horn [L\u202fIt] set itself up as equal to the prince of \u00b7heaven's armies [L\u202fthe hosts; C\u202fGod]. It \u00b7stopped [abolished] the \u00b7daily [regular] sacrifices [Ex. 29:38\u201341; Num. 28:3\u20138] that were offered to him, and the \u00b7Temple, the place where people worshiped him, [L\u202fplace of the sanctuary] was \u00b7pulled down [overthrown]. ", "12": "Because there was a \u00b7turning away from God [rebellion; transgression], the people stopped the \u00b7daily [regular] sacrifices. Truth was thrown down to the ground, and \u00b7the horn [L\u202fit] was successful in everything it did.", "13": "Then I heard \u00b7a holy angel [L\u202fone of the holy ones] speaking. Another \u00b7holy angel [L\u202fholy one] asked the first one, \u201cHow long will the things in this vision last\u2014the \u00b7daily [regular] sacrifices [8:12], the \u00b7turning away from God [rebellion; transgression] that brings \u00b7destruction [desolation], the \u00b7Temple [sanctuary] being pulled down, and the \u00b7army of heaven [host] being \u00b7walked on [trampled]?\u201d", "14": "The angel said to me, \u201cThis will happen for twenty-three hundred evenings and mornings [C\u202feither 2,300 or 1,150 days]. Then the \u00b7holy place [sanctuary] will be \u00b7repaired [restored; made right again].\u201d", "15": "I, Daniel, saw this vision and \u00b7tried to understand what it meant [L\u202fsought understanding]. I saw someone who looked like a man standing near me. ", "16": "And I heard a man's voice calling from the Ulai \u00b7Canal [or Gate]: \u201cGabriel [C\u202fan angel], explain the vision to this man.\u201d", "17": "\u00b7Gabriel [L\u202fHe] came to where I was standing. When he came close to me, I was \u00b7very afraid [terrified; or overwhelmed] and \u00b7bowed facedown on the ground [L\u202ffell on my face]. But \u00b7Gabriel [L\u202fhe] said to me, \u201c\u00b7Human being [L\u202fSon of man], understand that this vision is about the time of the end.\u201d", "18": "While \u00b7Gabriel [L\u202fhe] was speaking, I fell into a \u00b7deep sleep [trance] with my face on the ground. Then he touched me [C\u202fstrengthening him] and \u00b7lifted me to my feet [L\u202fmade me stand in my place]. ", "19": "He said, \u201cNow, I will \u00b7explain [make known; reveal] to you what will happen in the time of anger. Your vision was about the \u00b7set [appointed] time of the end.", "20": "\u201cYou saw a \u00b7male sheep [ram] with two horns, which are the kings of Media and Persia. ", "21": "The male goat is the king of \u00b7Greece [L\u202fJavan], and the big horn between its eyes is the first king [C\u202fAlexander the Great, who defeated Persia around 330 bc]. ", "22": "The four horns that grew in the place of the broken horn are four kingdoms [C\u202fAlexander died in 323 bc and his four most powerful generals carved up his empire between them]. Those four kingdoms will come from \u00b7the nation of the first king [L\u202fhis nation], but \u00b7they will not be as strong as the first king [L\u202fnot with his power/strength].", "23": "\u201cWhen the end comes near for those kingdoms, a \u00b7bold and cruel [fierce/stern-faced] king who \u00b7tells lies will come [L\u202funderstands riddles/enigmas; C\u202fAntiochus Epiphanes, who terrorized the Jews in the mid-second century bc]. This will happen when \u00b7many people have turned against God [rebellions/transgressions will reach their height]. ", "24": "\u00b7This king will be very powerful [L\u202fHis power will be strong], but \u00b7his power will not come from himself [L\u202fnot his own power].

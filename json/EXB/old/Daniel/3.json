Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They do not serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up.\u201d", "13": "Nebuchadnezzar \u00b7became very angry [flew into a rage] and called for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. When they were brought to the king, ", "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said, \u201cShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you do not serve my gods nor worship the gold statue I have set up?

If you \u00b7bow [L\u202ffall] down and worship the statue I made, that will be good. But if you do not worship it, you will immediately be thrown into the blazing furnace.

He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual. ", "20": "Then he commanded some of the \u00b7strongest soldiers in his army [L\u202fmen mighty in strength] to \u00b7tie up [bind] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.", "21": "So \u00b7Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego [L\u202fthe men] were \u00b7tied up [bound] and thrown into the blazing furnace while still wearing their \u00b7robes [tunics], trousers, turbans, and other clothes.

He asked the men who advised him, \u201cDidn't we tie up only three men and throw them into the fire?\u201d They answered, \u201c\u00b7Yes [True], O king.\u201d", "25": "The king said, \u201cLook! I see four men walking around in the fire. They are not \u00b7tied [bound] up, and they are not \u00b7burned [hurt]. The fourth man looks like a son of the gods [C\u202fa divine figure].\u201d", "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar \u00b7went to [approached] the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, \u201cShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, come out!

Their hair was not \u00b7burned [singed], their \u00b7robes [tunics] were not burned, and they didn't even smell like smoke!", "28": "Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \u201c\u00b7Praise [Blessed be] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Their God has sent his \u00b7angel [or messenger] and \u00b7saved [rescued; delivered] his servants from the fire! These three men trusted their God and \u00b7refused to obey [defied] \u00b7my [L\u202fthe king's] command.

No other god can \u00b7save [rescue; deliver] his people like this.\u201d ", "30": "Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the \u00b7area [province] of Babylon."}

{"1": "The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cHow long will you \u00b7continue to feel sorry [mourn; grieve] for Saul? I have rejected him as king of Israel. Fill your \u00b7container [flask; L\u202fhorn] with olive oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse who lives in Bethlehem, because I have \u00b7chosen [selected; found myself] one of his sons to be king.\u201d", "2": "But Samuel said, \u201c\u00b7If [L\u202fHow can\u2026?] I go, Saul will hear the news and will try to kill me.\u201d The Lord said, \u201cTake a \u00b7young calf [heifer] with you. Say, 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord.' ", "3": "Invite Jesse to the sacrifice. Then I will tell you what to do. You must \u00b7appoint [anoint] the one I \u00b7show you [indicate; designate; name; L\u202ftell you].\u201d", "4": "Samuel did what the Lord told him to do. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of Bethlehem \u00b7shook with fear [trembled]. They met him and asked, \u201cAre you coming in peace?\u201d", "5": "Samuel answered, \u201cYes, I come in peace. I have come to make a sacrifice to the Lord. \u00b7Set yourselves apart to the Lord [Consecrate/Purify/Sanctify yourselves] and come to the sacrifice with me.\u201d Then he \u00b7set Jesse and his sons apart to the Lord, [consecrated/purified/sanctified Jesse and his sons] and he invited them to come to the sacrifice.", "6": "When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab, and he thought, \u201cSurely, here stands before me the Lord's \u00b7appointed [anointed].\u201d", "7": "But the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDon't look at \u00b7how handsome Eliab is [his appearance] or \u00b7how tall he is [his height], because I have \u00b7not chosen [rejected] him. God does not see \u00b7the same way [as] people see. People look at \u00b7the outside of a person [appearances; the outward appearance], but the Lord looks \u00b7at [on] the heart.\u201d", "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab and told him to \u00b7pass by [walk in front of] Samuel. But Samuel said, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen this man either.\u201d ", "9": "Then Jesse had Shammah pass by. But Samuel said, \u201cNo, the Lord has not chosen this one.\u201d ", "10": "Jesse had seven of his sons \u00b7pass by [presented to] Samuel. But Samuel said to him, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen any of these.\u201d", "11": "Then he asked Jesse, \u201cAre these all the sons you have?\u201d Jesse answered, \u201cI still have the youngest son. He is out taking care of the sheep.\u201d Samuel said, \u201cSend for him. We will not sit down to eat until he arrives.\u201d", "12": "So Jesse sent and had his youngest son brought in. He was \u00b7a fine boy, tanned [dark; ruddy], [L\u202fwith beautiful eyes] and handsome. The Lord said to Samuel, \u201c\u00b7Go [Rise], \u00b7appoint [anoint] him, because he is the one.\u201d", "13": "So Samuel took the \u00b7container [flask; L\u202fhorn] of olive oil and \u00b7poured it on Jesse's youngest son to appoint [anointed] him in front of his brothers. From that day on, the Lord's Spirit \u00b7worked in [came powerfully upon] David. Samuel then went back to Ramah.", "14": "But the Lord's Spirit \u00b7had left [departed from] Saul, and an \u00b7evil [tormenting] spirit from the Lord \u00b7troubled [terrorized; afflicted] him.", "15": "Saul's servants said to him, \u201cSee, an \u00b7evil [tormenting] spirit from God is \u00b7troubling [terrorizing; afflicting] you. ", "16": "Give \u00b7us [L\u202fyour servants] the command to look for someone who can play the \u00b7harp [lyre]. When the \u00b7evil [tormenting] spirit from God \u00b7troubles [terrorizes; afflicts] you, he will play, and you will \u00b7feel better [be well].\u201d", "17": "So Saul said to his servants, \u201cFind someone who can play well and bring him to me.\u201d", "18": "One of the servants said, \u201cI have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem play the \u00b7harp [lyre]. He is brave and \u00b7courageous [a warrior]. He \u00b7is a good speaker [or has good judgment] and handsome, and the Lord is with him.\u201d", "19": "Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying, \u201cSend me your son David, \u00b7who is with the sheep [the shepherd].\u201d ", "20": "So Jesse loaded a donkey with bread, a \u00b7leather bag [wineskin] full of wine, and a young goat, and he sent them with his son David to Saul.", "21": "When David came to Saul, he \u00b7began to serve him [entered his service; L\u202fstood before him]. Saul \u00b7liked David [loved David very much] and made him \u00b7the officer who carried his armor [his armor bearer]. ", "22": "Saul sent a message to Jesse, saying, \u201cLet David \u00b7stay and serve me [remain in my service] because \u00b7I like him [I am pleased with him; L\u202fhe has found grace/favor in my sight].\u201d", "23": "When the \u00b7evil [tormenting] spirit from God \u00b7troubled [terrorized; afflicted] Saul, David would take his \u00b7harp [lyre] and play. Then the \u00b7evil [tormenting] spirit would leave him, and Saul would feel \u00b7better [refreshed; soothed]."}

You won't die! See, my father doesn't do anything \u00b7great or small [important or unimportant] without first \u00b7telling [confiding in] me. Why would he \u00b7keep [hide] this from me? It's not true!\u201d", "3": "But David \u00b7took an oath [vowed; swore], saying, \u201cYour father knows very well that \u00b7you like me [L\u202fI have found favor in your sight].

Now send for David and bring him to me. He \u00b7must [deserves to] die!\u201d", "32": "Jonathan asked his father, \u201cWhy should David be killed? What wrong has he done?\u201d ", "33": "Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan, \u00b7trying to kill [L\u202fto strike] him. So Jonathan knew that his father \u00b7really wanted [was determined] to kill David. ", "34": "Jonathan \u00b7was very angry [rose in fierce anger] and left the table. That second day of the \u00b7month [or New Moon festival] he refused to eat.

He had a young boy with him. ", "36": "Jonathan said to the boy, \u201cRun and find the arrows I shoot.\u201d When he ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.

He bowed facedown on the ground \u00b7before Jonathan three [three] times. Then David and Jonathan kissed each other and cried together, but David cried the more.", "42": "Jonathan said to David, \u201cGo in \u00b7peace [safety]. We have \u00b7promised [vowed; sworn] by the [L\u202fname of the] Lord \u00b7that we will be friends [to each other].

{"1": "The boy Samuel \u00b7served [ministered before] the Lord under Eli. In those days \u00b7the Lord did not speak directly to people very often [L\u202fthe word from the Lord was rare]; there were very few visions.", "2": "Eli's eyes were so \u00b7weak [dim] he \u00b7was almost blind [L\u202fcould not see]. One night he was lying in \u00b7bed [his usual place].

God's lamp [C\u202fprobably the Menorah] \u00b7was still burning [had not yet gone out].", "4": "Then the Lord called Samuel, and he answered, \u201cI am here!\u201d ", "5": "He ran to Eli and said, \u201cI am here. You called me.\u201d But Eli said, \u201cI didn't call you. Go back \u00b7to bed [and lie down].\u201d So Samuel went back \u00b7to bed [and lay down].", "6": "The Lord called again, \u201cSamuel!\u201d Samuel again went to Eli and said, \u201cI am here. You called me.\u201d Again Eli said, \u201cI didn't call you. Go back \u00b7to bed [and lie down].\u201d", "7": "Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and \u00b7the Lord had not spoken directly to him yet [L\u202fthe word of the Lord had not been revealed to him before].", "8": "The Lord called Samuel for the third time. Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, \u201cI am here. You called me.\u201d Then Eli \u00b7realized [understood; perceived; discerned that] the Lord was calling the boy.

If he calls you again, say, 'Speak, Lord. \u00b7I am your servant and I am [\u2026for your servant is] listening.'\u201d So Samuel went and lay down in \u00b7bed [his place].", "10": "The Lord came and stood there and called as he had before, \u201cSamuel, Samuel!\u201d Samuel said, \u201c\u00b7Speak, Lord.

Then Eli said, \u201cHe [or It] is the Lord.

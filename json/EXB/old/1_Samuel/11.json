Then he gave the pieces of the oxen to messengers and ordered them to carry them through all the land of Israel [C\u202fa ritual to curse an enemy]. The messengers said, \u201cThis is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who does not \u00b7follow [march with; C\u202finto battle] Saul and Samuel.\u201d So the \u00b7people became very afraid of the Lord [L\u202fterror/dread of the Lord fell on the people].

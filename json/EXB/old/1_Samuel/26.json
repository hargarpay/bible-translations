I won't need to \u00b7hit [L\u202fstrike] him twice.\u201d", "9": "But David said to Abishai, \u201cDon't \u00b7kill [L\u202fdestroy] Saul! \u00b7No one [Who\u2026?] can \u00b7harm [raise a hand against] the Lord's \u00b7appointed king [anointed] and still be \u00b7innocent [without guilt]!

Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?\u201d", "17": "Saul \u00b7knew [recognized] David's voice. He said, \u201cIs that your voice, David my son?\u201d David answered, \u201cYes, it is [L\u202fmy voice], my \u00b7master [lord] and king.\u201d ", "18": "David also said, \u201cWhy are you \u00b7chasing me [pursuing your servant], my \u00b7master [lord]?

Come back, David my son. Today you \u00b7respected [valued; considered precious] my life, so I will not try to hurt you. I have been very \u00b7stupid [wrong; mistaken] and foolish.\u201d", "22": "David answered, \u201c\u00b7Here is [T\u202fBehold] your spear [L\u202fO king].

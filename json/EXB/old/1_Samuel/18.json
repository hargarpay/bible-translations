{"1": "When David finished talking with Saul, \u00b7Jonathan felt very close to David [L\u202fthe life/soul of Jonathan was knit/bound to the life/soul of David]. He loved David as much as \u00b7he loved himself [L\u202fhis own life/soul]. ", "2": "Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him go home to his father's house. ", "3": "Jonathan made an \u00b7agreement [covenant; solemn pact; treaty] with David, because he loved David as much as \u00b7himself [L\u202fhis own life/soul]. ", "4": "He took off his \u00b7coat [robe; C\u202fperhaps a royal robe] and gave it to David, along with his \u00b7armor [tunic], including his sword, bow, and belt [C\u202fan expression of loyalty to David and perhaps even giving him the future kingship].", "5": "[L\u202fWherever] Saul sent David \u00b7to fight in different battles, and David [out, he] was very successful.

He thought, \u201cThe women \u00b7say David has killed [credit/ascribe to David] tens of thousands, but they \u00b7say I have killed [credit/ascribe to me] only thousands. The only thing left for him to have is the kingdom!\u201d ", "9": "So Saul watched David closely from then on, because he was jealous.", "10": "The next day an \u00b7evil [tormenting] spirit from God \u00b7rushed upon [overwhelmed; seized; possessed] Saul, and he \u00b7prophesied [or raved madly] in his house. David was playing the harp as he usually did, but Saul had a spear in his hand.

So Saul was afraid of David. ", "13": "He sent David away and made him commander of a thousand soldiers. So David led them \u00b7in battle [L\u202fout and back in].

The Philistines will do that.\u201d", "18": "But David answered Saul, saying, \u201cWho am I? \u00b7My family is not important enough [What is my father's family in Israel\u2026?] for me to become the king's son-in-law.\u201d ", "19": "So, when the time \u00b7came [should have come] for Saul's daughter Merab to marry David, Saul gave her instead to Adriel of Meholah [L\u202fas a wife].", "20": "Now Saul's other daughter, Michal, loved David. When they told Saul, \u00b7he was pleased [L\u202fthe matter was right in his eyes].

I am poor and \u00b7unimportant [have no position/reputation; C\u202fDavid cannot afford to pay the expected dowry].\u201d", "24": "When Saul's servants told him what David had said, ", "25": "Saul said, \u201cTell David, 'The king doesn't want \u00b7money [L\u202fa dowry/bride price] for the bride. All he wants is a hundred Philistine foreskins to get \u00b7even with [revenge on] his enemies.'\u201d Saul planned to let \u00b7the Philistines kill David [L\u202fDavid fall at the hands of the Philistines].", "26": "When Saul's servants told this to David, \u00b7he was pleased [he was happy/delighted; L\u202fthe thing was right in the eyes of David] to become the king's son-in-law.

", "29": "So he grew even more afraid of David, and he was David's enemy \u00b7all his life [from then on; L\u202fall the days].", "30": "The Philistine commanders continued to go out to fight the Israelites, but every time, David was more \u00b7skillful [successful; wise] than Saul's officers. So he became \u00b7famous [highly esteemed; L\u202fhis name became extremely valuable]."}

{"1": "Kish, son of Abiel from the tribe of Benjamin, was an \u00b7important man [man of wealth/rank/standing/valor]. (Abiel was the son of Zeror, who was the son of Becorath, who was the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.) ", "2": "Kish had a son named Saul, who was a \u00b7fine [handsome] young man. There was no Israelite \u00b7better [more handsome] than he. Saul stood \u00b7a head [head and shoulders] taller than any other man in Israel.", "3": "Now the donkeys of Saul's father, Kish, were lost. So Kish said to Saul, his son, \u201cTake one of the servants, and go and look for the donkeys.\u201d ", "4": "Saul went through the \u00b7mountains [hill country] of Ephraim and the \u00b7land [area; territory] of Shalisha, but he and the servant could not find the donkeys. They went into the \u00b7land [area; territory] of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. They went through the \u00b7land [area; territory] of Benjamin, but they still did not find them. ", "5": "When they arrived in the area of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, \u201cLet's go back or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and will start worrying about us.\u201d", "6": "But the servant answered, \u201cA man of God [C\u202fa title for a prophet] is in this town. People \u00b7respect [honor] him because everything he says comes true. Let's go \u00b7into the town now [L\u202fthere]. Maybe he can tell us \u00b7something about the journey we have taken [or what way to go].\u201d", "7": "Saul said to his servant, \u201cIf we go into the town, what can we give him? The \u00b7food [bread] in our bags is gone. We have no gift to give him. \u00b7Do we have anything [What do we have]?\u201d", "8": "Again the servant answered Saul. \u201cLook, I have \u00b7one-tenth of an ounce [L\u202fa quarter of a shekel] of silver. \u00b7Give [or I will give] it to the man of God. Then he will tell us \u00b7about our journey [L\u202fwhat to do/way to go].\u201d ", "9": "(In \u00b7the past [L\u202fthose days], if someone in Israel wanted to \u00b7ask something from [inquire of] God, he would say, \u201cLet's go to the seer.\u201d We call the person a prophet today, but in \u00b7the past [L\u202fthose days] he was called a seer.)", "10": "Saul said to his servant, \u201c\u00b7That's a good idea [Well said]. Come, let's go.\u201d So they went toward the town where the man of God was.", "11": "As Saul and the servant were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to \u00b7get [draw] water. Saul and the servant asked them, \u201cIs the seer here?\u201d", "12": "The young women answered, \u201cYes, he's here. He's ahead of you. Hurry now. He has just come to our town today, because the people will offer a sacrifice at the \u00b7place of worship [high place]. ", "13": "As soon as you enter the town, you \u00b7will [can] find him before he goes up to the \u00b7place of worship [high place] to eat. The people will not begin eating until the seer comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. After that, the guests will eat. Go now, and you should find him [L\u202fquickly; at once].\u201d", "14": "Saul and the servant went up to the town. Just as they \u00b7entered it [L\u202farrived in the midst of the town], they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the \u00b7place of worship [high place].", "15": "The day before Saul came, the Lord had \u00b7told [revealed this to] Samuel: ", "16": "\u201cAbout this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the \u00b7land [territory] of Benjamin. \u00b7Appoint [Anoint] him \u00b7to lead [L\u202fruler/prince over] my people Israel. He will \u00b7save [rescue; deliver] my people from the [L\u202fhand of the] Philistines. I have seen \u00b7the suffering of my people, and I have listened to their cry [L\u202fmy people because their cry has reached me].\u201d", "17": "When Samuel first saw Saul, the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cThis is the man I told you about. He will \u00b7organize [rule over; govern] my people.\u201d", "18": "Saul approached Samuel at the gate and said, \u201cPlease tell me where the seer's house is.\u201d", "19": "Samuel answered, \u201cI am the seer. Go \u00b7with [ahead of] me to the \u00b7place of worship [high place]. Today you and your servant are to eat with me. Tomorrow morning I will \u00b7answer all your questions [L\u202ftell you all that is in your heart/mind] and send you home. ", "20": "Don't worry about the donkeys you lost three days ago, because they have been found. Soon all the \u00b7wealth [desires] of Israel will \u00b7belong to [be focused/fixed on; turn to] you and your family.\u201d", "21": "Saul answered, \u201c\u00b7But I am [L\u202fAm I not\u2026?] from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel. And \u00b7my family group is [L\u202fis not my family/clan\u2026?] the \u00b7smallest [least] in the tribe of Benjamin. Why are you \u00b7saying such things [talking this way to me]?\u201d", "22": "Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into \u00b7a large room [the hall] and \u00b7gave them a choice place at [placed them at the head of] the table. About thirty guests were there. ", "23": "Samuel said to the cook, \u201cBring the meat I gave you, the portion I told you to set aside.\u201d", "24": "So the cook took the thigh and put it on the table in front of Saul. Samuel said, \u201cThis is the meat saved for you. Eat it, because it was set aside for you for this \u00b7special [appointed] time. \u00b7As I said, 'I had invited the people.' [or \u2026 even before I invited these others].\u201d So Saul ate with Samuel that day.", "25": "After they finished eating, they came down from the \u00b7place of worship [high place] and went to the town. Then Samuel \u00b7talked with [or prepared a bed for] Saul on the roof of his house [C\u202fthe flat roofs of Israelite houses served as living space]. ", "26": "At dawn they got up, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof. He said, \u201cGet up, and I will send you on your way.\u201d So Saul got up and went out of the house with Samuel. ", "27": "As Saul, his servant, and Samuel were getting near the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, \u201cTell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay, \u00b7because I have a message from [so I may give/proclaim the word of] God for you.\u201d"}

The best thing I can do is escape to the land of the Philistines. Then he will give up looking for me in Israel, and I can \u00b7get away from him [L\u202fescape from his hand].\u201d", "2": "So David and his six hundred men \u00b7left Israel and went [L\u202fcrossed over] to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.

Leave the Amalekites \u00b7so that I won't [or I will] destroy you with them, because you showed \u00b7kindness [lovingkindness; treaty faithfulness] to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt.\u201d So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.", "7": "Then Saul \u00b7defeated [L\u202fstruck] the Amalekites.

But the people told Samuel, \u201cSaul has gone to Carmel, where he has put up a monument \u00b7in his own honor [to himself]. Now he has gone down to Gilgal.\u201d", "13": "When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said, \u201cMay the Lord bless you! I have \u00b7obeyed [carried out; upheld] the Lord's commands.\u201d", "14": "But Samuel said, \u201cThen why do I hear \u00b7cattle mooing [oxen lowing] and sheep bleating?\u201d", "15": "Saul answered, \u201cThe \u00b7soldiers [people] took them from the Amalekites. They saved the best sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the Lord your God, but we \u00b7destroyed [devoted to destruction; 15:3] all the other animals.\u201d", "16": "Samuel said to Saul, \u201c\u00b7Stop [Enough]!

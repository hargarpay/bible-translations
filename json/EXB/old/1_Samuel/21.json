{"1": "David went to Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech \u00b7shook with fear [trembled; C\u202fperhaps rumors of Saul's displeasure were circulating] when he saw David, and he asked, \u201cWhy are you alone? Why is no one with you?\u201d", "2": "David answered him, \u201cThe king \u00b7gave me a special order [sent me on a mission; commissioned me]. He told me, 'No one must know \u00b7what I am sending you to do or what I told you to do [about the mission I am sending you on].' I told my [L\u202fyoung] men \u00b7where to meet me [to meet me at a certain place]. ", "3": "Now, what \u00b7food do you have with you [L\u202fis at hand]? Give me five loaves of bread or anything you find.\u201d", "4": "The priest said to David, \u201cI don't have any \u00b7plain [ordinary; regular] bread here, but I do have some \u00b7holy [consecrated; holy] bread [C\u202ffrom the Table of Presence; Ex. 25:23\u201330]. You may eat it if your men have \u00b7kept themselves from [not recently slept with] women [C\u202fsexual relations rendered a man ritually unclean; Lev. 15:16\u201318].\u201d", "5": "David answered [L\u202fthe priest and said to him], \u201cNo women have been near us \u00b7for days [or as usual on a campaign]. My men always keep \u00b7themselves [their bodies/L\u202fvessels] holy, even \u00b7when we do ordinary work [on an ordinary/common journey]. And this is especially true when the \u00b7work [journey] is holy.\u201d", "6": "So the priest gave David the \u00b7holy [consecrated] bread \u00b7from the presence of God [\u2014the bread of the Presence\u2014] because there was no other. Each day the holy bread was replaced with \u00b7hot [fresh] bread.", "7": "One of Saul's servants happened to be there that day. He had been \u00b7held there [detained] before the Lord [C\u202ffor some unspecified ritual purpose]. He was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.", "8": "David asked Ahimelech, \u201cDo you have a spear or sword here? The king's business was very \u00b7important [urgent], so I \u00b7left without [brought neither\u2026nor] my sword or any other weapon.\u201d", "9": "The priest answered, \u201cThe sword of Goliath the Philistine, the one you \u00b7killed [L\u202fstruck] in the Valley of Elah [ch. 17], is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the \u00b7holy vest [ephod; Ex. 28:6\u201314]. If you want it, you may take it. There's no other sword here but that one.\u201d David said, \u201cThere is \u00b7no other sword [none] like it. Give it to me.\u201d", "10": "That day David \u00b7ran away [L\u202ffled] from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath [C\u202fa major Philistine town]. ", "11": "But the servants of Achish said to him, \u201c\u00b7This is [L\u202fIsn't this\u2026?] David, the king of the \u00b7Israelites [L\u202fland]. \u00b7He's [L\u202fIsn't he\u2026?] the man they dance and sing about, saying: 'Saul has \u00b7killed thousands of his enemies [T\u202fslain his thousands], \u00b7but [and] David has \u00b7killed [T\u202fslain his] tens of thousands [18:7].'\u201d", "12": "David \u00b7paid attention to [L\u202ftook to heart] these words and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. ", "13": "So he \u00b7pretended to be crazy in front of Achish and his servants [L\u202fchanged his behavior in their eyes/presence]. \u00b7While he was with them [L\u202fIn their hands], he acted like a madman and \u00b7clawed [scratched; scribbled] on the doors of the gate and \u00b7let spit run [drooled] down his beard.", "14": "Achish said to his servants, \u201cLook at the man! He's crazy! Why do you bring him to me? ", "15": "\u00b7I [Don't I\u2026?] have enough madmen. I don't need you to bring him here to act like this in front of me! \u00b7Don't let him in [Must this one come into\u2026?] my house!\u201d"}

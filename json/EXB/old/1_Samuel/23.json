{"1": "\u00b7Someone told [News came to; L\u202fThey told] David, \u201cLook, the Philistines are fighting \u00b7against [at] Keilah and \u00b7stealing grain from [L\u202frobbing; plundering; looting] the threshing floors.\u201d", "2": "David \u00b7asked [inquired of] the Lord, \u201cShould I go and \u00b7fight [attack; L\u202fstrike] these Philistines?\u201d The Lord answered him, \u201cGo. \u00b7Attack [L\u202fStrike] the Philistines, and \u00b7save [rescue; deliver] Keilah.\u201d", "3": "But David's men said to him, \u201cWe're afraid here in Judah. We will be more afraid if we go to Keilah \u00b7where the Philistine army is [L\u202fagainst the ranks of the Philistines].\u201d", "4": "David \u00b7again asked [inquired again of] the Lord, and the Lord [L\u202fagain] answered, \u201cGo down to Keilah. I will \u00b7help you defeat [L\u202fgive into your hand] the Philistines.\u201d ", "5": "So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines and took their cattle. David \u00b7killed [slaughtered] many Philistines and \u00b7saved [rescued; delivered] the people of Keilah. ", "6": "(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the \u00b7holy vest [ephod] \u00b7with him [L\u202fin his hand] when he came to David at Keilah [C\u202fthe ephod probably held the Urim and Thummim used to determine God's will; Ex. 28:30].)", "7": "Someone told Saul that David was now at Keilah. Saul said, \u201cGod has \u00b7handed David over to me [L\u202fmade a stranger of him into my hand; C\u202fthe Hebrew is obscure]! He has \u00b7trapped [imprisoned] himself, because he has entered a town with gates and bars [C\u202fSaul could lay siege to such a town].\u201d ", "8": "Saul called all his army together for battle, and they prepared to go down to Keilah to \u00b7attack [L\u202fbesiege] David and his men.", "9": "David learned Saul was \u00b7making evil plans [plotting evil] against him. So he said to Abiathar the priest, \u201cBring the \u00b7holy vest [ephod].\u201d ", "10": "David prayed, \u201cLord, God of Israel, \u00b7I have [L\u202fyour servant has] heard that Saul plans to come to Keilah to destroy the town because \u00b7of me [I am here]. ", "11": "Will the \u00b7leaders [citizens; men] of Keilah \u00b7hand me over [surrender/betray me] to Saul? Will Saul come down to Keilah, as I heard? Lord, God of Israel, tell me, your servant!\u201d The Lord answered, \u201cSaul will come down.\u201d", "12": "Again David asked, \u201cWill the \u00b7leaders [citizens; men] of Keilah \u00b7hand [surrender; betray] me and my men over to Saul?\u201d The Lord answered, \u201cThey will [L\u202fsurrender/betray you].\u201d", "13": "So David and his six hundred men left Keilah and \u00b7kept moving from place to place [L\u202fwent/roamed wherever they could]. When Saul found out that David had escaped from Keilah, he \u00b7did not go there [gave up pursuit/the campaign].", "14": "David stayed in the \u00b7desert [wilderness] \u00b7hideouts [strongholds] and in the hills of the \u00b7Desert [Wilderness] of Ziph. Every day Saul looked for David, but the Lord did not \u00b7surrender David to him [L\u202fgive David into his hand].", "15": "While David was at Horesh in the \u00b7Desert [Wilderness] of Ziph, he learned that Saul was coming to kill him. ", "16": "But Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and \u00b7strengthened his faith [encouraged him; L\u202fstrengthened his hand] in God. ", "17": "Jonathan told him, \u201cDon't be afraid, because [L\u202fthe hand of] my father Saul won't \u00b7touch [L\u202ffind] you. You will be king of Israel, and I will be \u00b7second [next] to you. Even my father Saul knows this.\u201d ", "18": "The two of them \u00b7made [L\u202fcut] an \u00b7agreement [covenant; solemn pact] before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home, but David stayed at Horesh.", "19": "The people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and told him, \u201cDavid is hiding in our land. He's at the \u00b7hideouts [strongholds] of Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, \u00b7south of [in the southern part of] Jeshimon. ", "20": "Now, our king, come down \u00b7anytime you want [whenever you're ready]. It's our duty to hand David over to you.\u201d", "21": "Saul answered, \u201cThe Lord bless you for \u00b7helping [L\u202fshowing concern for; having compassion on] me. ", "22": "Go and \u00b7learn more about him [make sure]. \u00b7Find out [Investigate] where he is staying and who has seen him there. I have heard that he is \u00b7clever [very cunning/crafty]. ", "23": "Find all the hiding places he uses, and come back \u00b7and tell me everything [when you are sure; with definite information]. Then I'll go with you. If David is in the \u00b7area [land], I will \u00b7track him down [search him out] among all the \u00b7families [clans; or thousands] in Judah.\u201d", "24": "So they went back to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the \u00b7Desert [Wilderness] of Maon[a] in the \u00b7desert [wilderness] area south of Jeshimon. ", "25": "Saul and his men went to look for David, but David heard about it and went down to \u00b7a [the great] rock and stayed in the \u00b7Desert [Wilderness] of Maon. When Saul heard that, he \u00b7followed [pursued] David into the \u00b7Desert [Wilderness] of Maon.", "26": "Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side. They were hurrying to get away from Saul, because Saul and his men were \u00b7closing in on [surrounding] them. ", "27": "But a messenger came to Saul, saying, \u201cCome quickly! The Philistines are \u00b7attacking [raiding] our land!\u201d ", "28": "So Saul stopped chasing David and went to \u00b7challenge [meet; oppose] the Philistines. That is why people call this place Rock of \u00b7Parting [Escape; or Separations]. ", "29": "David also left the \u00b7Desert [Wilderness] of Maon and stayed in the \u00b7hideouts [strongholds] of En Gedi."}

{"1": "'I am the true vine', said Jesus, 'and my father is the gardener. ", "2": "He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn't bear fruit; and he prunes every branch that does bear fruit, so that it can bear more fruit. ", "3": "You are already clean. That's because of the word that I've spoken to you.", "4": "'Remain in me, and I will remain in you! The branch can't bear fruit by itself, but only if it remains in the vine. In the same way, you can't bear fruit unless you remain in me. ", "5": "I am the vine, you are the branches. People who remain in me, and I in them, are the ones who bear plenty of fruit. Without me, you see, you can't do anything.", "6": "'If people don't remain in me, they are thrown out, like a branch, and they wither. People collect the branches and put them on the fire, and they are burned. ", "7": "If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want, and it will happen for you.

", "15": "I'm not calling you \u201cservants\u201d any longer; servants don't know what their master is doing. But I've called you \u201cfriends\u201d, because I've let you know everything I heard from my father.", "16": "'You didn't choose me. I chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last. Then the father will give you whatever you ask in my name. ", "17": "This is my command to you: love one another.'", "18": "'If the world hates you,' Jesus went on, 'know that it hated me before it hated you. ", "19": "If you were from the world, the world would be fond of its own. But the world hates you for this reason: that you're not from the world. No: I chose you out of the world.", "20": "'Remember the word that I said to you: servants are not greater than their masters. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you too. If they kept my word, they will keep yours too.

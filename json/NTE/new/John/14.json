If that wasn't the case, I'd have told you, wouldn't I? I'm going to get a place ready for you! ", "3": "And if I do go and get a place ready for you, I will come back and take you to be with me, so that you can be there, where I am. ", "4": "And as to where I'm going\u00a0\u2013 you know the way!'", "5": "'Actually, Master,' said Thomas to him, 'we don't know where you're going, so how can we know the way?'", "6": "'I am the way,' replied Jesus, 'and the truth and the life! Nobody comes to the father except through me. ", "7": "If you had known me, you would have known my father. From now on you do know him! You have seen him.'", "8": "'Just show us the father, then, Master,' said Philip to Jesus, 'and that'll be good enough for us!'", "9": "'Have I been with you for such a long time, Philip,' replied Jesus, 'and still you don't know me? Anyone who has seen me has seen the father! How can you say, \u201cShow us the father\u201d? ", "10": "Don't you believe that I am in the father, and the father is in me? The words I'm speaking to you, I'm not speaking on my own initiative. It's the father, who lives within me, who is doing his own works.

If not, then trust because of all the things you've seen done.'", "12": "'I'm telling you the solemn truth,' Jesus continued. 'Anyone who trusts in me will also do the works that I'm doing. In fact, they will do greater works than these, because I'm going to the father! ", "13": "And whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, so that the father may be glorified in the son. ", "14": "If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.", "15": "'If you love me,' he went on, 'you will keep my commands.

The world can't receive him, because it doesn't see him or know him. But you know him, because he lives with you, and will be in you.", "18": "'I'm not going to leave you bereft. I am coming to you. ", "19": "Not long from now, the world won't see me any more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live too. ", "20": "On that day you will know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.", "21": "'Anyone who has my commandments and keeps them\u00a0\u2013 that's the person who loves me. Anyone who loves me will be loved by my father, and I will love them and show myself to them.'", "22": "Judas spoke up. (This was the other Judas, not Iscariot.) 'Master,' he said, 'how will it be that you will show yourself to us and not to the world?'", "23": "'If anyone loves me,' Jesus replied, 'they will keep my word. My father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. ", "24": "Anyone who doesn't love me won't keep my word. And the word which you hear isn't mine.

He has nothing to do with me. ", "31": "But all this is happening so that the world may know that I love the father, and that I'm doing what the father has told me to do. 'Get up. Let's be going.'"}

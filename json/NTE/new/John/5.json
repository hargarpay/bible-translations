{"1": "After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.", "2": "In Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool which is called, in Hebrew, Bethesda. It has five porticoes, ", "3": "where there were several sick people lying. They were blind, lame and paralysed.", "5": "There was a man who had been there, in the same sick state, for thirty-eight years. ", "6": "Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been there a long time already. 'Do you want to get well?' he asked him.", "7": "'Well, sir,' the sick man replied, 'I don't have anyone to put me into the pool when the water gets stirred up. While I'm on my way there, someone else gets down before me.'", "8": "'Get up,' said Jesus, 'pick up your mattress and walk!'", "9": "At once the man was healed. He picked up his mattress and walked. The day all this happened was a sabbath. ", "10": "So the Judaeans confronted the man who had been healed. 'It's the sabbath!' they said. 'You shouldn't be carrying your mattress!'", "11": "'Well,' he replied, 'the man who cured me told me to pick up my mattress and walk!'", "12": "'Oh, really?' they said. 'And who is this man, who told you to pick it up and walk?'", "13": "But the man who'd been healed didn't know who it was. Jesus had gone away, and the place was crowded.", "14": "After this Jesus found the man in the Temple. 'Look!' he said. 'You're better again! Don't sin any more, or something worse might happen to you!'", "15": "The man went off and told the Judaeans that it was Jesus who had healed him. ", "16": "This was why the Judaeans began to persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.", "17": "This was Jesus' response to them. 'My father', he said, 'is going on working, and so am I!'", "18": "So for this reason the Judaeans were all the more eager to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but spoke of God as his own father, making himself equal to God.", "19": "So Jesus made this response to them. 'I'm telling you the solemn truth,' he said. 'The son can do nothing by himself. He can only do what he sees the father doing. Whatever the father does, the son does too, and in the same way. ", "20": "The father loves the son, you see, and shows him all the things that he's doing. Yes: he will show him even greater things than these, and that'll amaze you! ", "21": "For, just as the father raises the dead and gives them life, in the same way the son gives life to anyone he chooses.", "22": "'The father doesn't judge anyone, you see; he has handed over all judgment to the son, ", "23": "so that everyone should honour the son just as they honour the father. Anyone who doesn't honour the son doesn't honour the father who sent him.", "24": "'I'm telling you the solemn truth: anyone who hears my word, and believes in the one who sent me, has the life of God's coming age. Such a person won't come into judgment; they will have passed out of death into life. ", "25": "I'm telling you the solemn truth: the time is coming\u00a0\u2013 in fact, it's here already!\u00a0\u2013 when the dead will hear the voice of God's son, and those who hear it will live. ", "26": "You see, just as the father has life in himself, in the same way he has given the son the privilege of having life in himself. ", "27": "He has even given him authority to pass judgment, because he is the son of man.", "28": "'Don't be surprised at this. The time is coming, you see, when everyone in the tombs will hear his voice. ", "29": "They will come out\u00a0\u2013 those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.'", "30": "'I can't do anything on my own authority,' Jesus went on. 'I judge on the basis of what I hear. And my judgment is just, because I'm not trying to carry out my own wishes, but the wishes of the one who sent me.", "31": "'If I give evidence about myself, my evidence isn't true. ", "32": "There is someone else who gives evidence about me, and I know that the evidence which he brings about me is true. ", "33": "You sent messengers to John, and he gave evidence about the truth. ", "34": "Not that I need evidence from human beings; but I'm saying this so that you may be saved.", "35": "'John was a burning, bright lamp, and you were happy to celebrate in his light for a while. ", "36": "But I have greater evidence on my side than that of John. The works which the father has given me to complete\u00a0\u2013 these works, which I'm doing, will provide evidence about me, evidence that the father has sent me. ", "37": "And the father who sent me has given evidence about me. You've never heard his voice; you've never seen his form. ", "38": "What's more, you haven't got his word abiding in you, because you don't believe in the one he sent.'", "39": "'You study the Bible', Jesus continued, 'because you suppose that you'll discover the life of God's coming age in it. In fact, it's the Bible which gives evidence about me! ", "40": "But you won't come to me so that you can have life.", "41": "'I'm not accepting glory from human beings; ", "42": "but I know that you haven't got the love of God within you. ", "43": "I have come in the name of my father, and you won't receive me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will receive him! ", "44": "How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another, and you're not looking for the glory which comes from the one and only God?", "45": "'Don't think that I'm going to accuse you to the father. There is someone who accuses you: it's Moses, the one you've put your hope in! ", "46": "You see, if you'd believed Moses, you would have believed me\u00a0\u2013 because it was me he was writing about. ", "47": "But if you don't believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?'"}

They have a diseased craving for disputes and arguments about words. That just leads to envy, jealousy, evil speaking, wicked suspicions ", "5": "and irritating arguments among people with depraved minds who have lost their grip on the truth and imagine that godliness is a means of gain.", "6": "If it's gain you want, though, there is plenty to be had in godliness\u00a0\u2013 if it's combined with contentment.

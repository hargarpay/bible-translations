", "3": "You know\u00a0\u2013 the secret purpose that God revealed to me, as I wrote briefly just now? ", "4": "Anyway ... When you read this you'll be able to understand the special insight I have into the king's secret. ", "5": "This wasn't made known to human beings in previous generations, but now it's been revealed by the spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. ", "6": "The secret is this: that, through the gospel, the Gentiles are to share Israel's inheritance. They are to become fellow members of the body, along with them, and fellow-sharers of the promise in King Jesus.", "7": "This is the gospel that I was appointed to serve, in line with the free gift of God's grace that was given to me. It was backed up with the power through which God accomplishes his work.", "8": "I am the very least of all God's people. However, he gave me this task as a gift: that I should be the one to tell the Gentiles the good news of the king's wealth, wealth no one could begin to count.

Some of them have come from miles off.'", "4": "'Where could you get food for all this lot, out here in the wilderness?' answered his disciples.", "5": "'How many loaves have you got?' he asked. 'Seven,' they replied.", "6": "He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them and gave them to his disciples to share around, and they gave them to the crowd.

", "23": "He took his hand, led him off outside the village, and put spittle on his eyes. Then he laid his hands on him, and asked, 'Can you see anything?'", "24": "'I can see people,' said the man, peering around, 'but they look like trees walking about.'", "25": "Then Jesus laid his hands on him once more. This time he looked hard, and his sight came back: he could see everything clearly. ", "26": "Jesus sent him back home.

", "38": "If you're ashamed of me and my words in this cheating and sinning generation, the son of man will be ashamed of you when he \u201ccomes in the glory of his father with the holy angels\u201d."}

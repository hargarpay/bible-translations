Watch out for yourselves: you too may be tested. ", "2": "Carry each other's burdens; that's the way to fulfil the Messiah's law. ", "3": "If you think you're something when you are not, you deceive yourself. ", "4": "Every one of you should test your own work, and then you will have a reason to boast of yourself, not of somebody else. ", "5": "Each of you, you see, will have to carry your own load.", "6": "If someone is being taught the word, they should share with the teacher all the good things they have. ", "7": "Don't be misled; God won't have people turning their noses up at him. What you sow is what you'll reap. ", "8": "Yes: if you sow in the field of your flesh you will harvest decay from your flesh, but if you sow in the field of the spirit you will harvest eternal life from the spirit.

", "15": "Circumcision, you see, is nothing; neither is uncircumcision! What matters is new creation. ", "16": "Peace and mercy on everyone who lines up by that standard\u00a0\u2013 yes, on God's Israel.", "17": "For the rest, let nobody make trouble for me. You see, I carry the marks of Jesus on my body.", "18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah be with your spirit, my dear family. Amen."}

{"1": "Jesus said to his disciples, 'Once there was a rich man who had a steward, and charges were laid against him that he was squandering his property. ", "2": "So he called him and said to him, \u201cWhat's all this I hear about you? Present an account of your stewardship; I'm not going to have you as my steward any more!\u201d", "3": "'At this, the steward said to himself, \u201cWhat shall I do? My master is taking away my stewardship from me! I can't do manual work, and I'd be ashamed to beg ...", "4": "'\u202f\u201cI have an idea what to do!\u00a0\u2013 so that people will welcome me into their households when I am fired from being steward.\u201d", "5": "'So he called his master's debtors to him, one by one. \u201cHow much\u201d, he asked the first, \u201cdo you owe my master?\u201d", "6": "'\u202f\u201cA hundred measures of olive oil,\u201d he replied. '\u202f\u201cTake your bill,\u201d he said to him, \u201csit down quickly, and make it fifty.\u201d", "7": "'To another he said, \u201cAnd how much do you owe?\u201d '\u202f\u201cA hundred measures of wheat,\u201d he replied.

The children of this world, you see, are wiser than the children of light when it comes to dealing with their own generation.", "9": "'So let me tell you this: use that dishonest stuff called money to make yourselves friends! Then, when it gives out, they will welcome you into homes that will last.'", "10": "'Someone who is faithful in a small matter', Jesus continued, 'will also be faithful in a large one. Someone who is dishonest in a small matter will also be dishonest in a large one. ", "11": "If you haven't been faithful with that wicked thing called money, who is going to entrust you with true wealth? ", "12": "And if you haven't been faithful in looking after what belongs to someone else, who is going to give you what is your own?", "13": "'Nobody can serve two masters. You will end up hating one and loving the other, or going along with the first and despising the other. You can't serve God and money.'", "14": "The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this, and mocked Jesus.

What people call honourable, God calls abominable!", "16": "'The law and the prophets lasted until John. From now on, God's kingdom is announced, and everyone is trying to attack it.

Even the dogs came and licked his sores.", "22": "'In due course the poor man died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. ", "23": "As he was being tormented in Hades, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom.", "24": "'\u202f\u201cFather Abraham!\u201d he called out. \u201cHave pity on me!

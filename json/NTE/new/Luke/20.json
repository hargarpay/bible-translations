{"1": "On one of those days, while Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple, and announcing the good news, the chief priests and the scribes came up with the elders, and said to him, ", "2": "'Tell us: by what authority are you doing these things? Or who gave you this authority?'", "3": "'I've got a question for you, too,' said Jesus, 'so tell me this: ", "4": "was John's baptism from God, or was it merely human?'", "5": "'If we say it was from God,' they said among themselves, 'he'll say, So why didn't you believe him? ", "6": "But if we say \u201cmerely human\u201d, all the people will stone us, since they're convinced that John was a prophet.'", "7": "So they replied that they didn't know where John and his baptism came from.", "8": "'Very well, then,' said Jesus. 'Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.'", "9": "Jesus began to tell the people this parable. 'There was a man who planted a vineyard, let it out to tenant farmers, and went abroad for a long while. ", "10": "When the time came, he sent a slave to the farmers to collect from them some of the produce of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ", "11": "He then sent a further slave, and they beat him, abused him, and sent him back empty-handed. ", "12": "Then he sent yet a third, and they beat him up and threw him out.", "13": "'So the master of the vineyard said, \u201cWhat shall I do? I'll send my beloved son. They will certainly respect him!\u201d ", "14": "But when the farmers saw him they said to each other, \u201cThis is the heir! Let's kill him, and then the inheritance will belong to us!\u201d ", "15": "And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 'So what will the master of the vineyard do? ", "16": "He will come and wipe out those farmers, and give the vineyard to others.' When they heard this, they said, 'God forbid!' ", "17": "But Jesus looked round at them and said, 'What then does it mean in the Bible when it says, The very stone the builders refused now for the corner's top is used?", "18": "'Everyone who falls on that stone will be smashed to smithereens; but if it falls on anyone, it will crush them.'", "19": "The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on him then and there. But they were afraid of the people, because they knew that Jesus had told this parable against them.", "20": "So the authorities watched Jesus, and sent people to lie in wait for him. They pretended to be upright folk, but were trying to trap him in something he said, so that they could hand him over to the rule and authority of the governor. ", "21": "So they asked him this question. 'Teacher,' they said, 'we know that you speak and teach with integrity. You are completely impartial, and you teach God's way and God's truth. ", "22": "So: is it right for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?'", "23": "Jesus knew they were playing a trick.", "24": "'Show me a tribute-coin,' he said. 'This image\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and this inscription\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. who do they belong to?' 'Caesar,' they said.", "25": "'Well, then,' replied Jesus, 'you'd better give Caesar back what belongs to him! And give God back what belongs to him.'", "26": "They couldn't catch him in anything he said in front of the people. They were amazed at his answer, and had nothing more to say.", "27": "Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus to put their question. (The Sadducees deny that there is any resurrection.)", "28": "'Teacher,' they said, 'Moses wrote for us that \u201cIf a man's brother dies, leaving a widow but no children, the man should marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.\u201d ", "29": "Well, now: there were seven brothers; the eldest married a wife, and died without children. ", "30": "The second ", "31": "and the third married her, and then each of the seven, and they died without children. ", "32": "Finally the woman died as well. ", "33": "So, in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? The seven all had her as their wife.'", "34": "'The children of this age', replied Jesus, 'marry and are given in marriage. ", "35": "But those who are counted worthy of a place in the age to come, and of the resurrection of the dead, don't marry, and they are not given in marriage. ", "36": "This is because they can no longer die; they are the equivalent of angels. They are children of God, since they are children of the resurrection.", "37": "'But when it comes to the dead being raised, Moses too declares it, in the passage about the burning bush, where scripture describes the Lord as \u201cthe God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob\u201d. ", "38": "God is God, not of the dead, but of the living. They are all alive to him.'", "39": "'That was well said, teacher,' commented some of the scribes, ", "40": "since they no longer dared ask him anything else.", "41": "Jesus said to them, 'How can people say that the Messiah is the son of David? ", "42": "David himself says, in the book of Psalms, The Lord says to the Lord of mine sit here at my right hand;", "43": "until I place those foes of thine right underneath thy feet.", "44": "'David, you see, calls him \u201cLord\u201d; so how can he be his son?'", "45": "As all the people listened to him, he said to the disciples, ", "46": "'Watch out for the scribes who like to go about in long robes, and enjoy being greeted in the market-place, sitting in the best seats in the synagogues, and taking the top table at dinners. ", "47": "They devour widows' houses, and make long prayers without meaning them. Their judgment will be all the more severe.'"}

'He's gone in to spend time with a proper old sinner!' they were saying.", "8": "But Zacchaeus stood there and addressed the master. 'Look, Master,' he said, 'I'm giving half my property to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I'm giving it back to them four times over.'", "9": "'Today,' said Jesus, 'salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. ", "10": "You see, the son of man came to seek and to save the lost.'", "11": "While people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell a parable.

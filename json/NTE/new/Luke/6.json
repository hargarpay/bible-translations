His disciples were plucking and eating ears of grain, rubbing them with their hands.", "2": "'Why', asked some Pharisees, 'are you doing something that isn't permitted on the sabbath?'", "3": "'Haven't you read what David did?' replied Jesus. 'When he and his men were hungry, ", "4": "he went into God's house and took the \u201cbread of the Presence\u201d, which no one but the priests was allowed to eat. He ate some, and gave it to his companions.", "5": "'The son of man', he declared, 'is Lord of the sabbath.'", "6": "On another sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching. A man was there whose right hand was withered. ", "7": "The scribes and Pharisees were watching him, to see if he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they could find an accusation against him.", "8": "He knew what they were thinking. 'Get up,' he said to the man with the withered hand, 'and come out here in the middle.' He got up and came out.", "9": "'Let me ask you something,' Jesus said to them. 'Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath or to do evil? To save life or to destroy it?'", "10": "He looked round at all of them. 'Stretch out your hand,' he said to the man. He did so; and his hand was restored. ", "11": "But they were filled with rage, and discussed with each other what they might do to Jesus.", "12": "It happened around that time that Jesus went up into the mountain to pray, and he spent all night in prayer to God. ", "13": "When day came, he called his disciples, and chose twelve of them, calling them 'apostles': ", "14": "Simon, whom he called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, Bartholomew, ", "15": "Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called 'the hothead', ", "16": "Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who turned traitor.", "17": "He went down with them, and took up a position on a level plain where there was a large crowd of his followers, with a huge company of people from all Judaea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon. ", "18": "They came to hear him, and to be cured from their diseases. Those who were troubled by unclean spirits were healed, ", "19": "and the whole crowd tried to touch him, because power was going out from him and healing everybody.", "20": "He lifted up his eyes and looked at his disciples, and said: 'Blessings on the poor: God's kingdom belongs to you!", "21": "'Blessings on those who are hungry today: you'll have a feast! 'Blessings on those who weep today: you'll be laughing!", "22": "'Blessings on you, when people hate you, and shut you out, when they slander you and reject your name as if it was evil, because of the son of man.

", "35": "No: love your enemies, do good and lend without expecting any return. Your reward will be great! You will be children of the Highest! He is generous, you see, to the stingy and wicked. ", "36": "You must be merciful, just as your father is merciful.", "37": "'Don't judge, and you won't be judged. Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned. Forgive, and you'll be forgiven.

Yes: the ration you give to others is the ration you'll get back for yourself.'", "39": "Jesus told them this riddle. 'What do you get when one blind man guides another?

When a flood came, the river burst its banks all over the house, but it couldn't shake it because it was well built.

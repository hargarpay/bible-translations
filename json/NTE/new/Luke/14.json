", "3": "So Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees, 'Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath or not?' ", "4": "They remained silent. He took the man, healed him, and dismissed him.", "5": "Then he said to them, 'Suppose one of you has a son\u00a0\u2013 or an ox!\u00a0\u2013 that falls into a well. Are you going to tell me you won't pull him out straight away on the sabbath day?' ", "6": "They had no answer for that.", "7": "He noticed how the guests chose the best seats, and told them this parable.", "8": "'When someone invites you to a wedding feast,' he said, 'don't go and sit in the best seat, in case some other guest more important is invited, ", "9": "and the person who invited you both comes and says to you, \u201cPlease move down for this man,\u201d and you will go to the end of the line covered with embarrassment. ", "10": "Instead, when someone invites you, go and sit down at the lowest place. Then, when your host arrives, he will say to you, \u201cMy dear fellow! Come on higher up!\u201d Then all your fellow guests will show you respect.

'When you give a lunch or a supper,' he said, 'don't invite your friends or your family or relatives, or your rich neighbours. They might ask you back again, and you'd be repaid.

The first said, \u201cI've just bought a field, and I really have to go and see it.

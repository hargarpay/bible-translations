", "2": "They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. ", "3": "They all ate the same spiritual food ", "4": "and drank the same spiritual drink. They drank, you see, from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was the Messiah. ", "5": "But God wasn't pleased with most of them, as you can tell by the fact that he laid them low in the desert.", "6": "Now these things were patterns for us, so that we should not start to crave for wicked things as they did. ", "7": "Nor should we commit idolatry, as some of them did\u00a0\u2013 as the Bible says, 'The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play.' ", "8": "Nor should we become immoral, like some of them became immoral, and twenty-three thousand fell on a single day. ", "9": "Nor should we put the Messiah to the test, as some of them put him to the test, and were destroyed by serpents. ", "10": "Nor should we grumble, as some of them grumbled and were destroyed by the destroyer.", "11": "Now these things happened to them as a pattern, and they were written for our instruction, since it's upon us that the ends of the ages have now come. ", "12": "As a result, anyone who reckons they are standing upright should watch out in case they fall over. ", "13": "Every test that comes upon you is normal for human beings. But God is faithful: he won't let you be tested beyond your ability. Along with the testing, he will provide the way of escape, so that you can bear it.", "14": "Therefore, my dear people, run away from idolatry. ", "15": "I'm speaking as to intelligent people: you yourselves must weigh my words. ", "16": "The cup of blessing which we bless is a sharing in the Messiah's blood, isn't it? The bread we break is a sharing in the Messiah's body, isn't it? ", "17": "There is one loaf; well, then, there may be several of us, but we are one body, because we all share the one loaf.", "18": "Consider ethnic Israel. Those who eat from the sacrifices share in the altar, don't they? ", "19": "So what am I saying? That idol-food is real, or that an idol is a real being? ", "20": "No: but when they offer sacrifices, they offer them to demons, not to God. And I don't want you to be table-partners with demons. ", "21": "You can't drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't share in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. ", "22": "Surely you don't want to provoke the Lord to jealousy?

For why should my freedom be condemned by someone else's conscience? ", "30": "If I eat my share gratefully, why should someone else speak evil of me because of something I've given thanks for?", "31": "So, then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to God's glory.

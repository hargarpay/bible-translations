{"1": "If I speak in human languages, or even in those of angels, but do not have love, then I've become a clanging gong or else a clashing cymbal. ", "2": "And if I should have prophetic gifts, and know all mysteries, all knowledge, too; have faith, to move the mountains, but have no love\u00a0\u2013 I'm nothing. ", "3": "If I give all my possessions to the poor, and, for pride's sake, my very body, but do not have love, it's useless to me.", "4": "Love's great-hearted; love is kind, knows no jealousy, makes no fuss, is not puffed up, ", "5": "no shameless ways, doesn't force its rightful claim, doesn't rage or bear a grudge,", "6": "doesn't cheer at others' harm, rejoices, rather, in the truth.", "7": "Love bears all things, believes all things, love hopes all things, endures all things.", "8": "Love never fails. But prophecies will be abolished; tongues will stop; and knowledge, too, be done away. ", "9": "We know, you see, in part; we prophesy in part; ", "10": "but, with perfection, the partial is abolished. ", "11": "As a child I spoke, and thought, and reasoned like a child; when I grew up, I threw off childish ways.", "12": "For at the moment all that we can see are puzzling reflections in a mirror; then, face to face. I know in part, for now; but then I'll know completely, through and through, even as I'm completely known. ", "13": "So, now, faith, hope, and love remain, these three; and, of them, love is the greatest."}

{"1": "Now when it comes to meat offered to idols, we know that 'We all have knowledge'. Knowledge puffs you up, but love builds you up! ", "2": "If anybody thinks they 'know' something, they don't yet 'know' in the way they ought to know. ", "3": "But if anybody loves God, they are 'known'\u00a0\u2013 by him.", "4": "So when it comes to food that has been offered to idols, we know that 'idols are nothing in the world', and that 'there is no God but one'. ", "5": "Yes, indeed: there may be many so-called 'gods', whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many 'gods' and many 'lords'. ", "6": "But for us There is one God, the father, from whom are all things, and we live to him and for him; and one Lord, Jesus the Messiah, through whom are all things, and we live through him.", "7": "The problem is that not everybody has this 'knowledge'. Some have been accustomed up to now to eating idol-food with the assumption that it really does belong to the idol. This has left them with a weak conscience, and now that conscience will be polluted. ", "8": "But the food we eat won't recommend us to God. We won't be any worse off if we don't eat, and we won't be any better off if we do.", "9": "But you must take care in case this official right of yours becomes a danger to the weak. ", "10": "Look at it like this: if someone with a weak conscience sees you, a person with 'knowledge', sitting down to eat in an idol-house, that conscience of theirs is likely to make up its mind actually to eat idol-food, isn't it? ", "11": "And so, you see, the weak person\u00a0\u2013 a brother or sister for whom the Messiah died!\u00a0\u2013 is then destroyed by your 'knowledge'. ", "12": "That means you'll be sinning against your brother or sister, and attacking their weak conscience; and in doing this you'll be sinning against the Messiah. ", "13": "So, for this reason, if food causes my brother or sister to stumble, I will never ever eat meat, so that I won't make my brother or sister trip up."}

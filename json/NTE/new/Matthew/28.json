{"1": "Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week; the sabbath was over. Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, had come to look at the tomb, ", "2": "when suddenly there was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came to the stone, rolled it away, and sat down on top of it. ", "3": "Looking at him was like looking at lightning, and his clothes were white, like snow. ", "4": "The guards trembled with terror at him, and became like corpses themselves.", "5": "'Don't be afraid,' said the angel to the women. 'I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified. ", "6": "He isn't here! He's been raised, as he said he would be! Come and see the place where he was lying\u00a0\u2013", "7": "and then go at once, and tell his disciples that he's been raised from the dead, and that he's going on ahead of you to Galilee. That's where you'll see him. There: I've told you.'", "8": "The women scurried off quickly away from the tomb, in a mixture of terror and great delight, and went to tell his disciples. ", "9": "Suddenly, there was Jesus himself. He met them and said, 'Greetings!' They came up to him and took hold of his feet, prostrating themselves in front of him.", "10": "'Don't be afraid,' said Jesus to them. 'Go and tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee. Tell them they'll see me there.'", "11": "While the women were on their way, some of the soldiers who had been on guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.

", "17": "There they saw him, and worshipped him, though some hesitated.", "18": "Jesus came towards them and addressed them. 'All authority in heaven and on earth', he said, 'has been given to me!

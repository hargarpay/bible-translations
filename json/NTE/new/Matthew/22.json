I've got my dinner ready; my bulls and fatted calves have been killed; everything is prepared. Come to the wedding!\u201d", "5": "'But they didn't take any notice. They went off, one to his own farm, another to see to his business. ", "6": "The others laid hands on his slaves, abused them and killed them. ", "7": "(The king was angry, and sent his soldiers to destroy those murderers and burn down their city.) ", "8": "Then he said to his slaves, \u201cThe wedding is ready, but the guests didn't deserve it. ", "9": "So go to the roads leading out of town, and invite everyone you find to the wedding.\u201d ", "10": "The slaves went off into the streets and rounded up everyone they found, bad and good alike. And the wedding was filled with partygoers.", "11": "'But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who wasn't wearing a wedding suit.", "12": "'\u202f\u201cMy friend,\u201d he said to him, \u201chow did you get in here without a wedding suit?\u201d And he was speechless.

You don't care what anyone thinks about you, because you don't try to flatter people or favour them. ", "17": "So tell us what you think.

", "31": "But as for the resurrection of the dead, did you never read what was said to you by God, in these words: ", "32": "\u201cI am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\u201d He isn't God of the dead, but of the living.'", "33": "The crowds heard this, and they were astonished at his teaching.", "34": "When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they got together in a group.

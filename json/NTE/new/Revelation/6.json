", "2": "And, as I watched, there was a white horse. Its rider was holding a bow. He was given a crown, and he went off winning victories, and to win more of them.", "3": "When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 'Come!' ", "4": "And another horse went out, fiery red this time. Its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth, so that people would kill one another. He was given a great sword.", "5": "When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 'Come!' As I watched, there was a black horse. Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. ", "6": "I heard something like a voice coming from the midst of the four living creatures. 'A quart of wheat for a denarius!' said the voice.

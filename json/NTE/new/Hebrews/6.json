(Let's not repeat the performance of laying a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith towards God, ", "2": "teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.) ", "3": "We shall do this, if God allows us to.", "4": "For once people have been enlightened\u00a0\u2013 when they've tasted the heavenly gift and have had a share in the holy spirit, ", "5": "and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age\u00a0\u2013 ", "6": "it's impossible to restore them again to repentance if they fall away, since they are crucifying God's son all over again, on their own account, and holding him up to contempt. ", "7": "You see, when rain falls frequently on the earth, and the land drinks it up and produces a crop useful to the people for whom it's being cultivated, it shares in God's blessing.

{"1": "In many ways and by many means God spoke in ancient times to our ancestors in the prophets; ", "2": "but at the end of these days he spoke to us in a son. He appointed this son to be heir of all things; through him, in addition, he created the worlds.", "3": "He is the shining reflection of God's own glory, the precise expression of his own very being; he sustains all things through his powerful word. He accomplished the cleansing needed for sins, and sat down at the right of the Majesty Supreme.", "4": "See how much greater he is than the angels: the name he was granted is finer than theirs.", "5": "For to which angel did God ever say, 'You are my son, today I became your father'? Or, again, 'I will be his father, and he will be my son'?", "6": "Again, when God brings the firstborn son into the world, he says, Let all God's angels worship him.", "7": "In relation to the angels, this is what it says: God makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire.", "8": "In relation to the son, however, it says, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of your kingdom;", "9": "you loved justice and hated lawlessness, therefore God, your God, anointed you with the oil of gladness, as superior to your comrades.", "10": "And, again: You established the earth, O Lord, from the beginning; and the heavens are the works of your hands;", "11": "they will be destroyed, but you will remain; all of them will grow old like clothing,", "12": "you will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed like clothing.

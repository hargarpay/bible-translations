", "4": "Some people have sneaked in among you, it seems, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation\u00a0\u2013 ungodly people, who are transforming God's grace into licentiousness, and denying the one and only master, our Lord Jesus the Messiah.", "5": "I do want to remind you, even though you know it all well, that when the Lord once and for all delivered his people out of the land of Egypt, he subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.

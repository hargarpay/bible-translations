I received my education here, in this city, and I studied at the feet of Gamaliel. I was trained in the strictest interpretations of our ancestral laws, and became zealous for God, just as all of you are today. ", "4": "I persecuted this Way, right to the point of killing people, and I bound and handed over to prison both men and women\u00a0\u2013 ", "5": "as the high priest and all the elders can testify. I received letters from them to the Jews of Damascus, where I was going in order to find the heretics who were there, tie them up, and bring them to Jerusalem to face their just deserts.", "6": "'Just as I was on the way, and getting near to Damascus, suddenly a bright light shone from heaven all around me.

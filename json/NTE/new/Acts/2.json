", "2": "Suddenly there came from heaven a noise like the sound of a strong, blowing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. ", "3": "Then tongues, seemingly made of fire, appeared to them, moving apart and coming to rest on each one of them. ", "4": "They were all filled with the holy spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the spirit gave them the words to say.", "5": "There were devout Jews from every nation under heaven staying in Jerusalem at that time. ", "6": "When they heard this noise they came together in a crowd. They were deeply puzzled, because every single one of them could hear them speaking in his or her own native language. ", "7": "They were astonished and amazed. 'These men who are doing the speaking are all Galileans, aren't they?' they said. ", "8": "'So how is it that each of us can hear them in our own mother tongues? ", "9": "There are Parthians here, and Medians, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judaea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, ", "10": "Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya that belong to Cyrene; there are people from Rome, ", "11": "proselytes as well as Jews; there are Cretans and Arabs. We can hear them telling us about the powerful things God has done\u00a0\u2013 in our own languages!'", "12": "Everyone was astonished and perplexed. 'What does it all mean?' they were asking each other.", "13": "But some sneered. 'They're full of new wine!' they said.", "14": "Then Peter got up, with the eleven. He spoke to them in a loud voice. 'People of Judaea!' he began. 'All of you staying here in Jerusalem! There's something you have to know! Listen to what I'm saying! ", "15": "These people aren't drunk, as you imagine.

", "31": "He foresaw the Messiah's resurrection, and spoke about him 'not being left in Hades', and about his flesh 'not seeing corruption'. ", "32": "This is the Jesus we're talking about! God raised him from the dead, and all of us here are witnesses to the fact! ", "33": "Now he's been exalted to God's right hand; and what you see and hear is the result of the fact that he is pouring out the holy spirit, which had been promised, and which he has received from the father.", "34": "'David, after all, did not ascend into the heavens. This is what he says: The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand,", "35": "until I place your enemies underneath your feet.", "36": "'So the whole house of Israel must know this for a fact: God has made him Lord and Messiah\u00a0\u2013 this Jesus, the one you crucified.'", "37": "When they heard this, the people in the crowd were cut to the heart. 'Brothers,' they said to Peter and the other apostles, 'what shall we do?'", "38": "'Turn back!' replied Peter. 'Be baptized\u00a0\u2013 every single one of you\u00a0\u2013 in the name of Jesus the Messiah, so that your sins can be forgiven, and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit.

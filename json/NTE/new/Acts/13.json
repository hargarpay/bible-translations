", "2": "As they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the holy spirit said, 'Set apart Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.' ", "3": "So they fasted and prayed; and then they laid their hands on them and sent them off.", "4": "So off they went, sent out by the holy spirit, and arrived at Seleucia. From there they set sail to Cyprus, ", "5": "and when they arrived in Salamis they announced God's word in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their assistant. ", "6": "They went through the whole of the island, all the way to Paphos. There they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. ", "7": "He was with the governor, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. He called Barnabas and Saul and asked to hear the word of God. ", "8": "The magician Elymas (that is the translation of his name) was opposing them, and doing his best to turn the governor away from the faith. ", "9": "But Saul, also named Paul, looked intently at him, filled with the holy spirit.", "10": "'You're full of trickery and every kind of villainy!' he said. 'You're a son of the devil! You're an enemy of everything that's right! When are you going to stop twisting the paths that God has made straight? ", "11": "Now see here: the Lord's hand will be upon you, and you will be blind for a while; you won't even be able to see the sun!' At once mist and darkness fell on him, and he went about looking for someone to lead him by the hand. ", "12": "When the governor saw what had happened, he believed, since he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.", "13": "Paul and his companions set off from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia.

'Fellow Israelites,' he said, 'and the god-fearers among you: listen. ", "17": "The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and he raised the people up to greatness during their stay in the land of Egypt. Then he led them out from there with his hand lifted high, ", "18": "and for about forty years he put up with them in the desert. ", "19": "He drove out seven nations from the land of Canaan, and gave them the land as their inheritance ", "20": "for about four hundred and fifty years. After that, he gave them judges, up until Samuel the prophet. ", "21": "After that, they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin. He ruled for forty years, ", "22": "and after God had removed him he raised up for them David as king.

They are now his witnesses to the people.", "32": "'We are here now to bring you the good news which was promised to our ancestors, ", "33": "that God has fulfilled this promise to us, their children, by raising Jesus. This corresponds, indeed, to what is written in the second Psalm: You are my son; this day I have begotten you.", "34": "'That he raised him from the dead, never more to return to corruption, conforms to what was written: I will give you the holy and faithful mercies of David.", "35": "'Because, as it says in another place, You will not hand over your holy one to see corruption.", "36": "'Now David served his own generation, and in the purposes of God he fell asleep and was gathered to his fathers. He did experience corruption. ", "37": "But the one God raised up did not experience corruption.

'God's word had to be spoken to you first,' they declared. 'But since you are rejecting it, and judging yourselves unworthy of the life of God's new age, look! We are turning to the Gentiles!

All those who were marked out for the life of God's new age became believers.

Through your wise foresight and planning things have greatly improved for this people. ", "3": "We welcome it in every way, in every place, and with every feeling of gratitude. ", "4": "But, so as not to keep you waiting any longer, I beg you, of your forbearance, to listen to us briefly.", "5": "'We find this fellow to be a public nuisance. He stirs up civil strife among all the Jews, all over the world. He is a ringleader in the sect of the Nazoreans. ", "6": "He even tried to defile the Temple! But we caught him.

", "12": "They didn't find me disputing with anybody in the Temple; nor was I stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues or elsewhere in the city.

I believe everything which is written in the law and the prophets, ", "15": "and I hold to the hope in God, for which they also long, that there will be a resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous. ", "16": "For that reason I make it my settled aim always to have a clear conscience before God and all people.", "17": "'For several years I have been collecting alms and offerings to bring to my nation.

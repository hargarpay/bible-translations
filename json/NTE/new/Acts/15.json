", "2": "This caused considerable uproar and dispute between them and Paul and Barnabas, and the church decided to send Paul and Barnabas, and some others from their fellowship, to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, to try to sort out the problem. ", "3": "So they were sent off by the church. They travelled through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling people as they went about the conversion of the Gentiles. They brought great joy to the Christian communities.", "4": "When they arrived in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church, the apostles and the elders, and they told them all the things that God had done with them. ", "5": "But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up. 'They must be circumcised,' they said, 'and you must tell them to keep the law of Moses.'", "6": "The apostles and elders gathered together to see what to do about this matter. ", "7": "After considerable argument, Peter got up. 'My brothers,' he said, 'you know that from our early days together God chose that it should be from my mouth that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.

", "9": "He made no distinction between us and them, but he purified their hearts through faith. ", "10": "So now, why are you putting God to the test, by placing a yoke on the disciples' neck which neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? ", "11": "Rather, we believe that it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus that we shall be saved, just like them.'", "12": "The whole company was silent, and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing the signs and wonders which God had done through them among the Gentiles.

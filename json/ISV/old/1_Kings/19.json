Take my life, because I'm not better than my ancestors!\u201d ", "5": "Then he lay down and went to sleep under the juniper tree.

Eat!\u201d", "6": "So he looked around, and there near his head was a muffin sitting on top of some heated stones, along with a jar of water. Elijah ate and drank and then lay down again.

The journey ahead[b] is too difficult for you!\u201d ", "8": "So Elijah[c] got up, ate and drank, and survived on that one meal for 40 days and nights as he set out on his journey to Horeb, God's mountain.", "9": "Elijah[d] arrived at a cave and stayed there.

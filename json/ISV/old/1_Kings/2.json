You have with you Gera's son Shimei the descendant of Benjamin from Bahurim. He cursed me violently that day when I had to leave for Mahanaim.

However, the kingdom has turned around and now belongs to my brother, because it went to him from the Lord. ", "16": "So now I'm asking one thing from you. Don't refuse me.\u201d \u201cTalk,\u201d she told him.", "17": "Then he asked her, \u201cPlease talk to King Solomon for me, since he won't refuse you.

Therefore the Lord is going to repay you for[n] all of your evil.

So the people left ", "6": "while King Rehoboam conferred with his advisors who had worked for his father Solomon during his administration. He asked them, \u201cWhat is your advice as to how I should respond to these people?\u201d", "7": "They advised him, \u201cIf today you are a servant, you will serve this people by answering them and speaking kindly to them. Then they will serve you forever.\u201d", "8": "But Rehoboam[c] ignored the counsel that his elder advisors had given him. Instead, he consulted the younger men who had grown up with him and who worked for[d] him.

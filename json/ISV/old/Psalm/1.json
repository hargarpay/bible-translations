He will prosper in everything he does.", "4": "But this is not the case with the wicked. They are like chaff that the wind blows away.", "5": "Therefore the wicked will not escape[e] judgment, nor will sinners have a place[f] in the assembly of the righteous.", "6": "For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will be destroyed."}

As a matter of fact, the senior officials and the rulers have been foremost in this sin.\u201d", "3": "When I heard this, I tore both my garment and robe, plucked hair from both my head and my beard, and collapsed in shock! ", "4": "Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered together as a group because of the sin committed by those who had been led astray. As for me, I remained seated, in shock, until the evening sacrifice.", "5": "At the time of the evening sacrifice, I arose from my discouragement. Still in my torn garment and robe, I fell to my knees with my hands outstretched to the Lord my God, ", "6": "and said, \u201cMy God, I am too ashamed and hurt to turn to you, because we're in our iniquities over our heads. Furthermore, my God, our sins have grown as high as the heavens.

", "8": "Though now, for a moment, grace has been shown[e] from the Lord our God, leaving a few survivors to escape, and providing us a secure hold in his Holy Place, so that our God might enlighten us and give us relief from our servitude.

Instead, he has extended gracious love to us in the presence of the kings of Persia, to grant us revival, to set up the Temple of our God, to repair its damage, and to give us a protective wall for Judah and Jerusalem.", "10": "Now, our God, what can we say besides this?

Would you not be angry with us until you had consumed us, with not even a remnant surviving[j] to escape?", "15": "Lord God of Israel, you are just: As a result, we remain here today delivered.

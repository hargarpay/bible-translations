I'll tell you whatever he reveals to me.\u201d And so he went to a high place, ", "4": "where the Lord met with Balaam, who told him, \u201cI've prepared seven altars and offered bulls and rams on an altar.\u201d", "5": "Then the Lord gave Balaam this message. \u201cReturn to Balak and speak to him.\u201d", "6": "So Balaam returned to where Balak had been standing, that is, next to his offerings, accompanied by all the Moabite officials.", "7": "Then Balaam uttered this prophetic statement: \u201cKing Balak of Moab brought me from Aram, from the eastern mountains, and told me, 'Come and curse Jacob for me. Come and curse Israel.'", "8": "But how can I curse those whom God hasn't cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord hasn't denounced?", "9": "I saw them from the top of the rocks. I watched them from the hills. Truly this is a people that lives by itself and doesn't matter[a] among the nations.", "10": "Who can count the dust of Jacob? Who can number the dust of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may I end up like him.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d Balak asked Balaam. \u201cI brought you to curse my enemies, not pronounce a blessing!\u201d", "12": "But in response, Balaam asked, \u201cShouldn't I be careful to communicate only what the Lord puts in my mouth?\u201d", "13": "\u201cCome with me to another place where you can see them,\u201d Balak replied. \u201cYou'll only see a portion of them, because you won't be able to see them completely. Come and curse them from there for me.\u201d", "14": "So Balak[b] took him to the field of Zophim, and from there to the top of Mount[c] Pisgah, where he built seven altars and then offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

Listen to me, you son of Zippor!", "19": "God is not a human male\u2014 he doesn't lie, nor is he a human being\u2014 he never vacillates. Once he speaks up, he's going to act, isn't he?

I'll take you to another place. Maybe God will agree to have you curse them for me from there.\u201d ", "28": "So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount[e] Peor, which overlooks the open wilderness.[f]", "29": "Balaam told Balak, \u201cBuild seven altars for me right here. Then prepare seven bulls and seven rams.\u201d ", "30": "Balak did just what Balaam had instructed\u2014he offered a bull and a ram on each altar."}

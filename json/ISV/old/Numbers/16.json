", "3": "They gathered together against Moses and Aaron and told them, \u201cYou have appropriated too much for yourselves from the entire congregation, since all of them are holy, and the Lord is among them, too. Why do you exalt yourselves over the Lord's assembly?\u201d", "4": "When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. ", "5": "Then he addressed Korah and his entire company, \u201cIn the morning, may the Lord reveal who belongs to him and who is holy. May he cause that person[a] to approach him. May he cause to approach him the one whom he has chosen. ", "6": "Korah, you and your entire company are to bring censers ", "7": "and put fire and incense in them in the Lord's presence tomorrow.

What is it that causes you to complain against him?\u201d", "12": "So Moses sent for Eliab's sons Dathan and Abiram, but they responded, \u201cWe're not coming. ", "13": "Is it such an insignificant thing that you brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness? Now you're trying to make yourself be a prince and rule over us, aren't you? ", "14": "You still haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you really think that you can make these men look the other way?[b] We won't go up.\u201d", "15": "Moses was very angry, so he told the Lord, \u201cPlease don't accept their offering.

The people[c] mourn for the land, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.", "3": "Their nobles send their young people for water. They go to the cisterns, but they find no water. They return with their vessels empty. They're disappointed[d] and dismayed, and they cover their heads in shame.[e]", "4": "The ground is cracked, because there has been no rain in the land. The farmers are disappointed,[f] and they cover their heads in shame.[g]", "5": "Even the doe in the field gives birth and then abandons her young[h] because there is no grass.", "6": "Wild donkeys stand on the barren hills. They pant for air like jackals. Their eyesight fails because there is no vegetation.\u201d", "7": "Lord, even though our iniquities testify against us, do something for the sake of your name. Indeed, our apostasies are many, and we have sinned against you.", "8": "Hope of Israel, its deliverer in time of trouble, why are you like a stranger[i] in the land, like a traveler who sets up his tent for a night?", "9": "Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a strong man who can't deliver? You are among us, Lord, and your name is the one by which we're called. Don't abandon us!", "10": "This is what the Lord says to these people: \u201cYes, they do love to wander, and they haven't restrained their feet. So the Lord won't accept them now. He will remember their iniquity and punish their sin.\u201d", "11": "Then the Lord told me, \u201cDon't pray for the welfare of these people.

Instead, I'll put an end to them with the sword, with famine, and with a plague.\u201d", "13": "Then I said, \u201cAh, Lord God, look! The prophets are saying to them, 'You won't see the sword and you won't experience famine. Rather, I'll give you lasting peace in this place.'\u201d", "14": "Then the Lord told me, \u201cThe prophets are prophesying lies[j] in my name. I didn't send them, I didn't command them, and I didn't speak to them. They're proclaiming[k] to you false visions, worthless predictions,[l] and the delusions of their own minds. ", "15": "Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the false prophets who prophesy in my name, 'There will be no sword and famine in this land' (though I haven't sent them): 'By the sword and by famine these prophets will be finished off!

Indeed, we have sinned against you.", "21": "For the sake of your name[r] don't despise us. Don't dishonor your glorious throne.

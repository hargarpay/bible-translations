For all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors.", "3": "They use their tongues like a bow. Lies rather than truth fly throughout[d] the land. They progress from one evil to another, and they don't know me,\u201d declares the Lord.", "4": "\u201cBeware of your neighbors, and don't trust any of your relatives. For all of your relatives act deceitfully, and every friend goes around as a slanderer.", "5": "People deceive their friends, and they don't tell the truth.

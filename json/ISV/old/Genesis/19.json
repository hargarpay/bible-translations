Please come inside your servant's house, wash your feet, and spend the night. Then you can get up early and be on your way.\u201d But they responded, \u201cNo, we would rather spend the night in the town square.\u201d", "3": "But Lot[c] kept urging them strongly, so they turned aside and entered his house. He prepared a festival and baked unleavened flat bread for them, and they ate.", "4": "Before they could lie down, all the men of Sodom and its outskirts, both young and old, surrounded the house.

This man came here as a foreigner, and now he's acting like a judge! So we're going to deal more harshly with you than with them.\u201d Then they pushed hard against the man (that is, against Lot), intending to break down the door.", "10": "But the angels[i] inside reached out, dragged Lot back into the house with them, shut the door, ", "11": "and blinded the men who were at the entrance of the house, from the least important to the greatest, so they were unable to find the doorway.", "12": "\u201cDo you have anyone else here in the city?\u201d the angels[j] asked Lot. \u201cA son-in-law? Sons? Daughters? Get them out of this place, ", "13": "because we're going to destroy it. Their outcry has come to the attention of the Lord, so he[k] sent us here to destroy it!\u201d", "14": "Lot then went out and told his sons-in-law (they had married his daughters), \u201cGet out of here! The Lord is going to destroy this city!\u201d But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.", "15": "As dawn was breaking, the angels pressured Lot. \u201cGet going!\u201d they told him. \u201cTake your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be engulfed by the devastation that's coming to this city.\u201d", "16": "But Lot kept lingering in the city,[l] so the men[m] grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters (because of the Lord's compassion for him!), brought them out of the city, and left them outside.

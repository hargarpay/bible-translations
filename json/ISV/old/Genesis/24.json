", "22": "When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her wrists, weighing 10 shekels and presented them to her.[g]", "23": "He asked her, \u201cWhose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?\u201d", "24": "\u201cI am the daughter of Bethuel,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe's the son of Milcah and Nahor.

", "31": "\u201cCome on,\u201d Laban[j] said. \u201cThe Lord has blessed you! So why are you standing out here when I've prepared some space in the house and a place for the camels?\u201d", "32": "So the servant went to the house and unbridled the camels. They provided straw and feed for the camels and water for washing his feet and those of the men with him.

So you are to choose a wife for my son from my family, from my father's household. ", "41": "Only then will you be released from fulfilling[n] my oath. However, when you come to my family, if they don't give her to you, you'll be released from fulfilling[o] my oath.'", "42": "\u201cSo today I arrived at the spring and prayed, 'Lord God of my master Abraham, if you wish to make the journey that I have traveled successful, ", "43": "here I am standing by the spring.

But if not, tell me, so that I may go elsewhere.\u201d[u]", "50": "\u201cSince this has come from the Lord,\u201d Laban and Bethuel both replied, \u201cwe cannot speak one way or another.[v] ", "51": "So here's Rebekah\u2014she's right in front of you. Take her and go, so she can become a wife for your master's son, just as the Lord has decreed.\u201d", "52": "When Abraham's servant heard what they had said, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord. ", "53": "Then the servant brought out some silver and gold items, along with some clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave gifts to her brother and to her mother. ", "54": "He and the men with him ate and drank, and then they spent the night. When they got up the next morning, the servant[w] requested, \u201cSend me off to my master.\u201d", "55": "But her brother and mother said, \u201cLet the young lady stay with us a few days\u2014at least ten\u2014and after that she may go.\u201d", "56": "\u201cPlease don't delay me,\u201d the servant[x] answered them. \u201cThe Lord has made my journey successful.

On the day that the Lord God made the universe,[g] ", "5": "no shrubs had yet grown in the meadows of the earth and no vegetation had sprouted,[h] because the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there were no human beings[i] to work the ground. ", "6": "Instead, an underground stream[j] would arise out of the earth and water the surface of the ground.

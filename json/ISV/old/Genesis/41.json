Then Pharaoh woke up a second time,[c] and it had been a very vivid[d] dream!", "8": "The very next morning, he[e] was frustrated[f] about the dream, so he sent word to summon all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them what he had dreamed, but no one could interpret them.[g]", "9": "Then Pharaoh's senior security advisor[h] spoke up. \u201cMaybe I should make a confession.

He provided specific meanings for each of our dreams. ", "13": "And what he interpreted for each of us came true! Pharaoh[k] restored me to my responsibilities, but he executed[l] the other man.\u201d", "14": "Pharaoh sent word to summon Joseph quickly from the dungeon, so they shaved his beard, changed his clothes, and then sent him straight to Pharaoh.

I've heard that you can interpret dreams.\u201d", "16": "\u201cI can't do that,\u201d Joseph replied, \u201cbut God is concerned about Pharaoh's well-being.\u201d", "17": "So Pharaoh told Joseph, \u201cIn my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile River, ", "18": "and all of a sudden seven healthy, plump, beautiful cows emerged from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds that line the bank.[m] ", "19": "Just then, seven other cows emerged after them, poor, ugly, and appearing very gaunt in their flesh. I've never seen anything as ugly as those cows anywhere in the entire land of Egypt! ", "20": "But those thin, gaunt cows gobbled up the first seven healthy cows! ", "21": "Not only that,\u201d Pharaoh continued,[n] \u201cafter they had finished devouring the cows, nobody could tell that they had gobbled them up, because they were just as ugly as before.

", "27": "The seven gaunt cows that arose after the healthy cows[q] are seven years, as are the seven gaunt ears scorched by the east wind. There will be seven years of famine.

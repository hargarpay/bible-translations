Pay special attention to Jericho.\u201d So they went out, came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, and lodged there.", "2": "Then the king of Jericho was told, \u201cLook! Israeli men arrived tonight to scout out the land.\u201d", "3": "So the king of Jericho sent for Rahab and ordered her, \u201cBring out the men who came to visit you and lodged in your house, because they've come to scout out the entire land.\u201d", "4": "Now the woman had taken the two men and hid them. So she replied, \u201cThe men really did come to me, but I didn't know from where they came. ", "5": "At dusk, when it was time to close the city gates, the men left. I don't know where the men went. Go after them quickly, and[b] you might overtake them.\u201d", "6": "But she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them among stalks of flax that she had laid out in order on the roof.

As soon as the search party had left, they shut the city gate after them.", "8": "Before the scouts[c] had lain down, she went up to them on the roof ", "9": "\u201cI'm really convinced that the Lord has given you the land,\u201d she said,[d] \u201cbecause we're overwhelmed with fear of you. All the other inhabitants of the land are demoralized at your presence, ", "10": "because we heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Reed[e] Sea right in front of you as you were coming out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other[f] side of the Jordan River\u2014to Sihon and Og\u2014whom you completely destroyed. ", "11": "When we heard these reports,[g] we all became terrified and discouraged[h] because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath.

Then when the Lord gives us this land, we'll treat you graciously and faithfully.\u201d", "15": "So she let them down by a rope through the window, since her house was built into the town wall where she lived. ", "16": "She told them, \u201cGo out to the hill country, so the search party won't find you, and hide for three days.

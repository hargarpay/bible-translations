Since he had been a man of war, Gilead and Bashan were allocated to him.[b]", "2": "Now allotments were made[c] with respect to the remaining descendants of Manasseh according to their families: for the descendants of Abiezer, the descendants of Helek, the descendants of Asriel, the descendants of Shechem, the descendants of Hepher, and the descendants of Shemida\u2014the male descendants of Joseph's son Manasseh, according to their families.", "3": "Hepher's son Zelophehad, grandson of Gilead and great-grandson of Manasseh's son Machir had no sons, only daughters.

", "5": "That is why ten allotments fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan River, ", "6": "since the granddaughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. (The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.)", "7": "The border of Manasseh proceeded from Asher to Michmethath east of Shechem, then turned south to include the inhabitants of En-tappuach.

These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, with the border of Manasseh on the north of the brook, terminating at the Mediterranean[f] Sea.", "10": "The southern area was allocated to Ephraim and the northern area to Manasseh. The Mediterranean[g] Sea was the border, extending to Asher on the North and to Issachar on the east.

You are not to have only one allotment, ", "18": "but the hill country will also belong to you. Even though it's a forest, you will clear it and possess it to its farthest borders.

Joshua selected 30,000 valiant warriors and sent them out by night, ", "4": "telling them, \u201cPay attention now! You are to set up an ambush around the city. Don't go very far from the city, and all of you remain on alert. ", "5": "I and all of the army with me will advance upon the city. When they come out after us like they did before, we'll run away from them.

As they pursued Joshua, they were drawn away from the town. ", "17": "There wasn't a single man left in Ai or Bethel who didn't run out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.", "18": "Then the Lord told Joshua, \u201cStretch out the battle lance[e] that's in your hand toward Ai, because I will give it into your control.\u201d So Joshua stretched out the battle lance[f] that was in his hand toward the city.

Israel attacked them until no one was left to survive or escape.

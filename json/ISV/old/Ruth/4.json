Just then, the very same related redeemer whom Boaz had mentioned came by, so Boaz[b] called out to him, \u201cCome over and sit down here, my friend!\u201d So the man came over and sat down.", "2": "Boaz[c] selected ten of the town elders and spoke to them, \u201cSit down here.\u201d So they sat down ", "3": "and Boaz[d] addressed the related redeemer directly: \u201cA portion of a field belonging to our relative Elimelech is up for sale by Naomi, who recently returned from the country of Moab. ", "4": "So I thought to myself I ought to tell you that you must make a public purchase of this before the town residents and the elders of my people. So if you intend to act as the related redeemer, then do so.[e] But if not, let me know, because except for you\u2014and I after you\u2014there is no one to fulfill the duties of a related redeemer.\u201d The man responded, \u201cI will act as related redeemer.\u201d", "5": "Boaz continued, \u201cOn the very day you obtain the field from Naomi,[f] I'll be obtaining[g] Ruth the Moabite woman, the widow of the late heir,[h] so the family name may be continued[i] as an inheritance.\u201d", "6": "At this, the nearer related redeemer replied, \u201cThen I am unable to act as related redeemer, because that would complicate my own inheritance. You act instead as the related redeemer, because I cannot do so.\u201d[j]", "7": "During Israel's earlier history,[k] all things concerning redeeming or changing inheritances were confirmed by a man taking off his sandal and giving it to the other party,[l] thereby creating a public[m] record in Israel.

I will marry her to continue the family name as an inheritance, so that the name of the deceased does not disappear from among his relatives, nor from the public record.[n] You are all witnesses today!\u201d", "11": "Then all of the assembled people,[o] including the elders who were there, said, \u201cWe are witnesses! May the Lord make this woman who enters your house like Rachel and Leah, who together established the house of Israel. May you prosper in Ephrathah, and may you excel in Bethlehem!

He will teach us about his ways, and we will walk according to his directions.' \u201cIndeed, the Law will proceed from Zion, and the message of the Lord from Jerusalem.", "3": "And he will judge among many people, rebuking strong nations far away; and they will reshape their swords as plowshares and their spears as pruning hooks. No nation will threaten another,[b] nor will they train for war anymore.", "4": "Instead, each man will sit in the shade of[c] his grape vines and beneath the shade of[d] his fig tree,\u201d since the[e] Lord of the Heavenly Armies has spoken.", "5": "\u201cBecause all of the people will walk, each person in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.", "6": "\u201cAt that time,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cI will assemble the lame; and I will gather those whom I have scattered, along with those whom I have afflicted.", "7": "I will transform the lame into survivors, and those who were scattered into a strong nation; and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion, now and forever.\u201d", "8": "\u201cAnd you, watchtower of the flock, you stronghold of the daughter of Zion, it will happen even to you: The former dominion, even the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem, will come.", "9": "Why are you crying so loud now?

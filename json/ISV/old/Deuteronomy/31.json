He will destroy these nations in front of you and you will dispossess them. As for Joshua, he will cross over before you, just as the Lord promised. ", "4": "The Lord will do to them just as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land when he destroyed them. ", "5": "The Lord will hand them over to you, so you can do to them what I've instructed you to do. ", "6": "Be strong and courageous. Don't fear or tremble before them, because the Lord your God will be the one who keeps on walking with you\u2014he won't leave you or abandon you.\u201d", "7": "Then Moses called on Joshua and told him in the presence of everyone in Israel, \u201cBe strong and courageous, because you'll bring this people to the land that the Lord your God had promised to give your ancestors. You will be the one who causes them to possess it. ", "8": "Indeed, the Lord is the one who will keep on walking in front of you. He'll be with you and won't leave you or abandon you, so never be afraid and never be dismayed.\u201d", "9": "Then Moses wrote down this Law and gave it to the Levitical priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and to all of Israel's leaders.[a] ", "10": "Then he[b] gave these[c] orders: \u201cAt the end of seven years, the year designated for release,[d] during the Festival of Tents,[e] ", "11": "when all of Israel comes to appear in the presence of the Lord your God at the place that he'll choose, read this Law aloud to them.[f] ", "12": "Gather the people\u2014the men, women, children, and the foreigners that live in your cities\u2014so they may hear and fear the Lord your God, and so they may be careful to obey the words contained in this Law.

You've heard it said, 'Who can stand up against the Anakim?'[c] ", "3": "But know today that the Lord your God is going ahead of you as a consuming fire. He will destroy and subdue them before you. He will dispossess and destroy them quickly, just as the Lord told you. ", "4": "After the Lord has expelled them before you, you are not to say to yourselves, 'The Lord caused me to enter and possess this land because of my righteousness.' ", "5": "On the contrary, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you to confirm what the Lord promised by an oath to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

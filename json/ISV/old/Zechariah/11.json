Wail, oak trees of Bashan, for the old growth forest has been cut down.", "3": "Hear[b] the wailing of the shepherds, for the magnificence of the forest[c] is ruined! Hear[d] the roar of the lions, for the Jordan's arrogance is ruined!", "4": "This is what the Lord my God says: \u201cShepherd the flock marked for[e] slaughter. ", "5": "Their buyers slaughter them without being punished, continuing to sell them as they say, 'Bless the Lord!' and, 'I'm rich!' Meanwhile, their shepherds show them no compassion. ", "6": "Therefore I will no longer show compassion upon those who live in the land,\u201d declares the Lord. \u201cLook! I will deliver every single person into the control[f] of his neighbor and into the control[g] of the king. Even though they assault the land, I will not deliver it from their control.\u201d[h]", "7": "So I became shepherd of the flock marked for[i] slaughter, paying attention to the oppressed of the flock. I took two staffs\u2014naming one \u201cPleasant\u201d and the other one \u201cUnion\u201d\u2014and then I pastured the flock.

Instead, he will devour the meat of the best of the sheep, tearing off their hoofs.\u201d", "17": "\u201cWoe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock!

When the man you're looking for is dead, all the rest of the people will return quietly.\u201d", "4": "Even though this plan seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all of the elders of Israel, ", "5": "Absalom replied, \u201cCall in Hushai the Archite so I can hear what he has to say, too!\u201d ", "6": "When Hushai approached Absalom, Absalom asked him, \u201cHere's what Ahithophel had to advise.

", "9": "Look! He's probably already hiding in a cave or someplace like that. If the first attack fails, people will hear about it and think, 'Absalom's army is losing!' ", "10": "Then even men who would otherwise be as brave as lions will be scared, because every Israeli knows your father is a mighty man, and they know his men are valiant! ", "11": "So here's my advice: Muster everybody from one end of the country to the other![c] You'll have an army in number like the sand on the seashore! Then you'll go into battle!

We won't leave a single stone left in the valley!\u201d", "14": "Absalom and all of the Israelis replied, \u201cThe advice of Hushai the Archite is better than Ahithophel's!\u201d But the Lord had planned to circumvent the sound advice of Ahithophel so the Lord could bring Absalom to destruction.

That way, if he crosses the river, the king and his entourage[d] will survive.\u201d", "17": "Meanwhile, since they could not risk being seen entering the city, Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at En-rogel, where a young servant woman was to go to inform them and they would then go brief King David.

So Absalom's servants went away in search of Jonathan and Ahimaaz, but they couldn't find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.", "21": "A little while later, the men crawled up out of the well and went off to talk to King David. They told David, \u201cGet up!

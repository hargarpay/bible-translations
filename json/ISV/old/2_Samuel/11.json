They utterly destroyed the Ammonites and then attacked Rabbah while David remained in Jerusalem. ", "2": "Late one afternoon about dusk,[b] David got up from his couch and was walking around on the roof of the royal palace. From there[c] he watched a woman taking a bath, and she[d] was very beautiful to look at.", "3": "David sent word[e] to inquire about her,[f] and someone told him, \u201cThis is Eliam's daughter Bathsheba,[g] the wife of Uriah the Hittite, isn't it?\u201d ", "4": "So David sent some messengers, took her from her home,[h] and she went to him, and he had sex with her. (She had been consecrating herself following her menstrual separation.)[i] Then she returned to her home.", "5": "The woman conceived, and she sent this message[j] to David: \u201cI'm pregnant.\u201d", "6": "So David summoned Joab, and told him,[k] \u201cSend me Uriah the Hittite.\u201d So Joab sent Uriah to David.

", "9": "But Uriah spent the night sleeping in the alcove of the king's palace in the company of all his master's staff members. He refused to go down to his own home.", "10": "When David was told that Uriah hadn't gone home the previous night,[n] he quizzed him,[o] \u201cYou just arrived from a long journey, so why didn't you go down to your own house?\u201d", "11": "Uriah replied, \u201cThe ark, along with Israel and Judah, are encamped in tents, while my commanding officer Joab and my master's staff members are camping out in the open fields. Should I go home, eat, drink, and have sex with my wife? Not on your life![p] I won't do something like this, will I?\u201d", "12": "Then David invited Uriah, \u201cStay here today, and tomorrow I'll send you back.\u201d So Uriah remained in Jerusalem all that day and the next.

Later that evening, Uriah went out to lie on a couch in the company of his lord's servants, and he did not go down to his house.", "14": "The next morning, David sent a message to Joab that Uriah took with him in his hand. ", "15": "In the message, he wrote: \u201cAssign Uriah to the most difficult fighting at the battle front, and then withdraw from him so that he will be struck down and killed.\u201d ", "16": "So as Joab began to attack the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew valiant men would be stationed.[q] ", "17": "When the men of the city came out to fight Joab, some of David's army staff members fell, and Uriah the Hittite died, too.", "18": "Then Joab sent word to David about everything that had happened at the battle.

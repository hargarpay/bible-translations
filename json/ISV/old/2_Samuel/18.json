The king informed the army, \u201cI'm going out to battle[b] with you, too.\u201d", "3": "\u201cNo way!\u201d his army responded. \u201cIf we have to retreat from the battle, Absalom's men won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care about us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. The best thing you can do for us is to remain in the city.\u201d", "4": "So David responded, \u201cI'll do what you think best.\u201d Then he stood alongside the city gate as the army went out in battle array by hundreds and thousands. ", "5": "As they were going out, the king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, \u201cTreat young Absalom gently for my sake.\u201d Everyone heard what the king had ordered his commanders about Absalom.", "6": "David's army left for the battlefield to fight Absalom and his Israeli followers, and they also fought in the Ephraim forest, ", "7": "where David's army of servants defeated the Israelis. Many died that day\u201420,000 men. ", "8": "The battle spread throughout the entire countryside, and the forest claimed more casualties that day than did the sword fighting.", "9": "Absalom happened to run into David's soldiers. While Absalom was trying to get away on his mule, it ran under the thick branches of a giant oak tree, and Absalom's head got caught in the tree! As his mule ran out from under him, Absalom was left hanging above the ground.

Why didn't you kill him right then and there? I would've given you ten pieces[c] of silver and a warrior's sash!\u201d[d]", "12": "But the soldier replied to Joab, \u201cI wouldn't have touched the king's son even if you dropped 1,000 pieces[e] of silver right into my hands, because we heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, 'Watch how you treat the young man Absalom!'

Then the Israelis ran away back to their homes.", "18": "While Absalom had been living, he had erected a pillar as a monument[j] to himself in King's Valley because he had been telling himself, \u201cI don't have a son to carry on my family name.\u201d[k] So he named the pillar after himself\u2014it's called Absalom's Monument even today.", "19": "Zadok's son Ahimaaz told Joab, \u201cLet me run over to King David and take him the news. I'll mention that the Lord has delivered him from his enemies.\u201d", "20": "But Joab answered Ahimaaz, \u201cYou're not the man to deliver news today. Do it any other time, but not today, because the king's son is dead.\u201d ", "21": "So Joab ordered a man from Ethiopia,[l] \u201cGo tell the king what you've seen.\u201d So the Ethiopian[m] saluted[n] Joab and then ran to tell David.", "22": "\u201cPlease,\u201d Zadok's son Ahimaaz continued, \u201cNo matter what happens, let me follow the Ethiopian!\u201d Joab asked him, \u201cWhy this request[o] to run, my son? There's no reward in it for you.\u201d", "23": "\u201cNo matter what, I'm running,\u201d Ahimaaz replied.[p] So Joab told Ahimaaz, \u201cRun!\u201d And Ahimaaz ran, taking the Jordan Valley road, passing the Ethiopian.", "24": "Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city. The watchman was up on the roof of the gateway near the walls, looking around, and there was a man running by himself! ", "25": "So the watchman[q] called out his news to the king. The king responded, \u201cIf he's alone, he's bringing some news to report.\u201d[r] As the man continued to draw near and approach the palace,[s] ", "26": "the watchman observed another man running. So he called out to the gatekeeper, \u201cThere's another[t] man running by himself!\u201d The king replied, \u201cHe's also bringing some news to report!\u201d", "27": "Then the watchman observed, \u201cIt looks to me that the runner out in front is running like Zadok's son Ahimaaz!\u201d The king replied, \u201cThis is a good man bearing good news!\u201d", "28": "\u201cEverything's fine!\u201d[u] Ahimaaz announced to the king. He bowed low with his face to the ground[v] before the king and said, \u201cPraise be to the Lord your God! He has handed over the men who rebelled against your majesty the king.\u201d", "29": "\u201cAre things fine[w] with respect to the young man Absalom?\u201d the king asked. Ahimaaz answered, \u201cI saw a lot of confusion about the time Joab was getting ready to send the king's courier and me, your servant, but I'm not sure what was going on.\u201d[x]", "30": "The king replied, \u201cStand here at attention and wait.\u201d So he stepped to the side and stood there waiting.", "31": "Just then the Ethiopian arrived. He[y] reported, \u201cGood news, your majesty the king! The Lord has delivered you from the control of everyone who rebelled against you!\u201d", "32": "The king asked the Ethiopian, \u201cIs the young man safe?\u201d The Ethiopian answered, \u201cMay the enemies of your majesty the king\u2014including everyone who rebels and tries to harm you\u2014become like that young man\u2026.\u201d", "33": "[z]Deeply shaken, the king went up to the chamber overlooking the city gate, weeping bitterly and crying out as he went along, \u201cMy son Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you, Absalom my son, my son!\u201d"}

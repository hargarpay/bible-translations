He answered him, \u201cI just escaped from Israel's encampment.\u201d", "4": "David continued questioning him, \u201cHow did things go? Please tell me!\u201d He replied, \u201cThe army has fled the battlefield, many of the army are wounded[b] or have died, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.\u201d", "5": "David asked the young man who related the story,[c] \u201cHow do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\u201d", "6": "The young man who had been relating the story[d] answered, \u201cI happened to be on Mount Gilboa and there was Saul, leaning on his spear! Meanwhile, the chariots and horsemen were rapidly drawing near. ", "7": "Saul[e] glanced behind him, saw me, and called out to me, so I replied, 'Here I am!' ", "8": "He asked me, 'Who are you?'

He clothed you in scarlet luxury and decorated your garments with gold.", "25": "How have the valiant fallen in the tumult of battle! Jonathan lies slain on your high places.", "26": "I am in distress for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been most kind[o] to me.

He has maimed feet,\u201d Ziba answered.", "4": "So David asked, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d Ziba responded, \u201cHe's in Lo-debar at the home of Ammiel's son Makir.\u201d", "5": "At this, King David sent for him and brought him from the home of Ammiel's son Makir in Lo-debar.

I am your servant,\u201d he replied.", "7": "\u201cDon't be afraid,\u201d David reassured him, \u201cbecause I'm going to show gracious love to you in memory[b] of your father Jonathan.

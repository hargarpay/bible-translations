", "3": "Tell them,[c] 'This is what the Lord God says: \u201cWatch out! I'm coming to get you, Mount Seir! I'm stretching out my hand to strike you, and I'm going to turn you into a desolate wasteland.", "4": "I'm going to turn your cities into ghost towns, and you will become a ruin. Then you will learn that I am the Lord.", "5": "\u201cBecause of your undying hatred, you kept on making the Israelis experience abuse[d] during the time of their calamity, even when they were in their final stages[e] of punishment, ", "6": "therefore as I'm alive and living,\u201d declares the Lord God, \u201cI'm turning you over to bloodshed,[f] and bloodshed will certainly overtake you, since you never have hated shedding blood. That's why bloodshed will certainly pursue you. ", "7": "I'm turning Mount Seir over to ruin and desolation. I'm going to eliminate everyone who comes and goes, ", "8": "and I'll fill that[g] mountain with the dead.

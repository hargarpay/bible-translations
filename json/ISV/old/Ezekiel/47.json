The water flowed down from beneath the right side of the Temple,[a] that is, from the south-facing side where the altar was located.

To my amazement, water was trickling out from that part of[b] the south side, too!", "3": "As the man went out toward the east, he carried a measuring line in his hand. He measured out 1,000 cubits[c] as he led me through water that was ankle-deep. ", "4": "Then he measured out another 1,000 cubits,[d] where he led me through water that was knee-deep. And then he measured out another 1,000 cubits,[e] where the water was waist-deep.

There will be a great many fish, because this water will flow there and turn the salt water fresh. As a result, everything will live wherever the river flows.

There will be all sorts of species of fish, as abundant as the fish that live in the Mediterranean[j] Sea. There will be lots of them!", "11": "\u201cThe river delta[k] will consist of swamps and marshes that will remain a salt water wetland preserve. ", "12": "Lining each side of the river banks, all sorts of species of fruit trees will be growing. Their leaves will never wither and their fruit will never fail. They will bear fruit every month, because the water that nourishes them will be flowing from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves will contain substances that promote healing.\u201d", "13": "This is what the Lord God says: \u201cThis is to be the territorial border by which you apportion the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel, with Joseph double-portioned.

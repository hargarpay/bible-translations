{"1": "Then the Spirit[a] shouted right in my ears with a loud voice! \u201cCome forward,\u201d he said, \u201cyou executioners of the city, and bring your weapon of destruction in your[b] hand!\u201d", "2": "All of a sudden, I noticed six men approaching from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each of them held a destructive weapon in his hand. Among them there was one man, clothed in linen, who was equipped with a writing set[c] at his side. They went in and presented themselves beside the bronze altar. ", "3": "Then the glory that is Israel's God arose from the cherubim on which he had been seated and settled on the threshold of the Temple. He called out to the man dressed in linen who wore the writing case at his side.", "4": "The Lord told him, \u201cGo throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of everyone who sighs and moans over all of the loathsome things that are happening in it.\u201d", "5": "As I continued to listen, he also told the others, \u201cFollow him through the city and start killing. Don't spare anyone you see, and don't show pity of any kind. ", "6": "You are to execute old men, young men, young women, little children, and women. But don't touch anyone who has been marked. Begin at my Holy Place!\u201d And so they started with the elders who were in standing in front of the Temple.", "7": "\u201cDesecrate my Temple,\u201d he told them, \u201cand fill its courtyard with the dead!\u201d So they went out and began striking down people throughout the city.", "8": "While they were out carrying out the executions, I was left alone. So I fell on my face and cried out, \u201cO Lord God, are you going to destroy all of the survivors of Israel when you pour out your anger on Jerusalem?\u201d", "9": "\u201cThe house of Israel and Judah is guilty\u2014and theirs is a stubborn guilt, at that!\u201d he replied to me. \u201cThe land is filled with blood, and the city overflows with injustice, because they keep saying, 'The Lord has abandoned the land,' and 'The Lord isn't watching.' ", "10": "So as for me, I'm not going to show pity, and I won't look in their direction with mercy. I'm repaying them for what they have done.\u201d", "11": "Then I noticed the man dressed in linen who wore the writing case by his side as he brought back this message: \u201cI've done as you have commanded me.\u201d"}

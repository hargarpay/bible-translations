From deep within the cloud,[i] something was shining that appeared to have a color like bronze that had been placed in fire until it glowed.", "5": "Deep inside it, the likenesses of four living beings were visible. Their appearances were similar to human forms, ", "6": "except that they each had four faces, four pairs of wings,[j] ", "7": "and straight legs. Their feet resembled calves' hooves, but they gleamed like polished bronze. ", "8": "From under their wings there were human hands on their four sides. Now as to their four faces and four pairs of wings, ", "9": "their pairs of wings overlapped each other. They moved in straight directions without turning their faces around as they moved.

Their wings spread out above and around them, one pair overlapping another, with one pair covering themselves. ", "12": "Each moved in straight directions. Wherever they decided[l] to go, they went without turning themselves.", "13": "Now, in the midst of the living beings there was something that[m] appeared to glow like coals kindled by a fire,[n] like torches that moved back and forth between the living beings. The fire was dazzling, and lightning flashed from the fire. ", "14": "The living beings moved around, in appearance resembling lightning.", "15": "As I observed the living beings, I noticed one wheel on the earth beside each being\u2014that is, for the four of them.[o] ", "16": "Their wheels and their construction details looked like gold-colored beryl.[p] Each wheel was identical in form to the others,[q] and they appeared to have been constructed and designed as if one wheel were within another. ", "17": "Whenever the four moved, no matter which of four directions, they moved without turning around.", "18": "Their wheel rims were ornate[r] and terrifying. They were full of eyes that surrounded the four of them. ", "19": "Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved, too. Whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also.

There was the likeness of the appearance of a human being seated on the likeness of the throne high above.

Below this there was something resembling fire, with a radiant light surrounding him. ", "28": "The appearance of the radiant light resembled that of a rainbow shining in a cloud on a rainy day. This was what the appearance of the form of the glory of the Lord resembled. When I saw all of this,[z] I fell flat on my face. Then I heard a voice speaking."}

Their sacrifices will seem like food for mourners\u2014 everyone who eats them will become unclean; none of them will enter the Temple of the Lord.", "5": "\u201cWhat will you do on the designated holiday, when the Lord's festival comes?", "6": "Look! They have gone away because of the destruction\u2014 Egypt will gather them up, and Memphis[a] will bury them. Weeds will overgrow their inheritance,[b] and thorns will grow[c] in their tents.", "7": "The time for your judgment has now come; payday is here\u2014 and Israel knows it. The prophet is a fool, and the spiritual man is insane. Because of your great sin, the hatred against you[d] is great.", "8": "While Ephraim stands watch with my God, the prophet has snares set that will trap his ways, and hostility lodges in the Temple of his God.", "9": "They have corrupted themselves deeply, as did Gibeah[e] in its day.

You will give them a womb that miscarries and dry breasts.", "15": "\u201cAll of their wickedness started[i] in Gilgal, because I began to hate them there. Because of the wickedness of their behavior, I will drive them from my Temple. I will not love them anymore; all their leaders are rebels.", "16": "Ephraim is blighted;[j] its roots shriveled. It can bear no fruit. Even if they bear children, I will kill their cherished offspring.", "17": "\u201cMy God will reject them, because they did not obey him, and they will become wanderers among the nations.\u201d"}

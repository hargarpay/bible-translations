{"1": "A pronouncement[a] about Nineveh: The record of the vision of Nahum[b] from Elkosh.", "2": "A jealous God, the Lord avenges. The Lord avenges; The Lord is an angry husband. The Lord takes vengeance on his enemies, reserving anger for his adversaries.", "3": "The Lord is slow to anger and powerful, and he will never let the guilty[c] go unpunished. The Lord's path is in the windstorm and hurricane; thunderclouds are dust beneath his feet.", "4": "He rebukes the sea, and it evaporates; he dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, while the flowers of Lebanon languish.", "5": "Mountains shake because of him, and the hills melt. The earth goes into upheaval at his presence, as does the world with all of its inhabitants.", "6": "Who can stand before his fury? And who can endure his fierce anger? His displeasure pours out like fire, and rocks are broken to pieces because of him.", "7": "The Lord is good\u2014 a refuge in troubled times.[d] He knows those who are confiding in him.", "8": "But with an overwhelming deluge he will bring utter desolation to Nineveh,[e] and his enemies he will pursue with darkness.", "9": "What are you scheming against the Lord?

I will cut out the graven and molten images from the temples of your gods. I myself will dig your grave, because you are vile.\u201d", "15": "[n]Look! There on the mountains! The feet of the one who brings good news, who broadcasts a message of peace. Judah, celebrate your solemn festivals and keep your vows, because the wicked will never again invade you. Nineveh[o] will be[p] completely eliminated!"}

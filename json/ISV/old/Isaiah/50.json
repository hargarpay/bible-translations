It's because of your sins that you were sold, and because of your transgressions that your mother was sent away.", "2": "Why is it that when I came, no one was there? Why was there no answer when I called? Was my arm[a] too short to redeem you? Do[b] I lack the strength to rescue you? Look! By my mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert. Their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.", "3": "I clothe the skies with darkness and make sackcloth their covering.\u201d", "4": "\u201cThe Lord God has given me a learned tongue, so that I may know how to sustain the weary with words. And[c] morning after morning he wakens, and[d] he wakens my ear to listen like those who are being taught.", "5": "My Lord God[e] has opened my ears, and I did not rebel; I did not shrink back.", "6": "I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard.[f] I did not turn away[g] my face from insults and spitting.", "7": "For the Lord God helps me, so I won't be disgraced.

Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God.", "11": "Look! All those[l] who light a fire, who surround yourselves with flaming torches\u2014 walk by the light of your fire, and by the torches that you have set ablaze! This is what you will receive from my hand: you will lie down in torment."}

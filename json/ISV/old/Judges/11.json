", "5": "When this happened,[b] the elders of Gilead went to the territory of Tob to find Jephthah. ", "6": "They told him, \u201cCome and be our commander so we can fight the Ammonites!\u201d", "7": "But Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, \u201cWeren't you the ones who hated me and drove me out of my father's house? And you come to me now that you're in trouble?\u201d", "8": "So the elders of Gilead told Jephthah, \u201cWell, we're coming back to you now so you can accompany us, fight the Ammonites, and become the head of all the inhabitants of Gilead.\u201d", "9": "Then Jephthah asked the elders of Gilead, \u201cIf you all send me to fight against the Ammonites and the Lord hands them over right in front of me, will I really become your head?\u201d", "10": "The elders of Gilead responded to Jephthah, \u201cMay the Lord serve[c] as a witness that we're making this agreement between ourselves to do as we've said.\u201d ", "11": "So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people appointed him head and military commander over them. Jephthah uttered everything he had to say with the solemnity of an oath[d] in the Lord's presence at Mizpah.", "12": "Afterwards, Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites to ask him, \u201cWhat's your dispute between us that prompted you to come and attack my land?\u201d", "13": "The king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, \u201cWe're here[e] because Israel took away my land from the Arnon River as far as the Jabbok River and as far as the Jordan River when they came up from Egypt! So restore it as a gesture of good will.\u201d[f]", "14": "But Jephthah sent additional messengers again to the king of the Ammonites ", "15": "and they informed him, \u201cThis is Jephthah's response: 'Israel didn't seize the land of Moab nor the land of the Ammonites.

They encamped on the other side of the Arnon River, but never entered the territory of Moab because the Arnon River is the border of Moab.", "19": "'Then Israel sent a delegation to Sihon, king of the Amorites and king of Heshbon. Israel requested of him, \u201cPlease let us pass through your territory to our place.\u201d ", "20": "But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his territory, so he assembled his entire army, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

The Lord gave them into his control. ", "33": "He attacked them from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith\u2014twenty cities in all[q]\u2014even as far as Abel-keramim.

Except for her, he had no other son or daughter. ", "35": "When he saw her, he ripped his clothes and cried out, \u201cOh no! My daughter! You have terribly burdened me! You've joined those who are causing me trouble, because I've given my word[r] to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it.[s]", "36": "She told him, \u201cMy father, you have given your word[t] to the Lord. Do to me according to what has come out of your own mouth, considering that the Lord has paid back your enemies, the Ammonites.\u201d ", "37": "Then she continued talking with her father, \u201cDo this for me: leave me alone by myself for two months.

Keep in mind that I'm like your own close relative.\u201d[b]", "3": "So his mother's relatives spoke all of this on his behalf in the presence[c] of all the \u201clords\u201d of Shechem. Since they were inclined to follow Abimelech, they said, \u201cHe's our relative!\u201d ", "4": "and they gave him 70 silver coins from the temple that they had built to[d] Baal-berith.

They just look[r] like men to you.\u201d", "37": "Gaal spoke up again to say, \u201cLook!

So where's your boasting now? You said, 'Who is Abimelech? Should we serve him?' Isn't this the army that you insulted? So go out right now and fight them!\u201d", "39": "So Gaal went out in full view of the \u201clords\u201d of Shechem and fought Abimelech. ", "40": "Abimelech chased him, and Gaal ran away from him. Many fell wounded right up to the entrance to the city gate.

Hurry up! Do the same thing!\u201d", "49": "Then his entire army also cut down a branch for each soldier, followed Abimelech to the inner chamber, and set fire to it[x] while they were inside. As a result, all the men of the tower of Shechem died, including about a thousand men and women.", "50": "Later on, Abimelech went to Thebez, set up a siege encampment there, and captured it. ", "51": "But there was a fortified tower in the center of the city, and all the men, women, and leaders of the city escaped to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.

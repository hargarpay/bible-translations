Your majesty,[b] all of them are your majesty's servants, aren't they? So why should your majesty demand this? Why should he bring guilt to Israel?\u201d", "4": "But the king's order overruled Joab, so Joab left, traveled throughout all of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem ", "5": "to report the total population count to David.

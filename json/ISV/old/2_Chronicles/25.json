{"1": "Amaziah began his reign at the age of 25 years, and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan. She was from Jerusalem. ", "2": "He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, but not with a perfect heart. ", "3": "As soon as he had consolidated his royal authority, he executed the servants who had killed his father, the king, ", "4": "but he did not execute their children in obedience to what is written in the Law, the writings of Moses, where the Lord commanded, \u201cFathers are not to die because of what their children do, nor are children to die because of what their fathers do, but each person is to die for his own sins.\u201d[a]", "5": "Amaziah gathered Judah together and organized them according to their ancestral households under commanders of thousands and hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered an army from those who were 20 years old and older. He discovered that there were 300,000 elite soldiers qualified for war duty and capable of handling spears and shields. ", "6": "He also hired 100,000 elite forces from Israel, paying 100 talents[b] of silver for their services.", "7": "A man came from God and warned him, \u201cYour majesty, don't let the army of Israel accompany you into battle, because the Lord isn't with any of the descendants of Ephraim. ", "8": "But if you do go, strengthen yourself for war. Do you think God will throw you down before the enemy, since God has the power both to help or to overthrow?\u201d", "9": "Amaziah asked the man of God, \u201cWhat are we to do about the 100 talents[c] that I have paid to the army of Israel?\u201d The man of God answered, \u201cThe Lord has a lot more than that to give you!\u201d ", "10": "So Amaziah sent the troops home who had arrived from Ephraim. They flew into a rage against Judah but left for home very angry.", "11": "But Amaziah encouraged himself and led his army out to the Salt Valley to kill 10,000 soldiers from Seir. ", "12": "The army of Judah captured another 10,000 prisoners and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down from there where they all were dashed to pieces. ", "13": "Meanwhile, the troops that Amaziah had sent home from the battle raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, killing 3,000 people and taking a large amount of war booty.", "14": "Later, Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, but he brought back the gods that had belonged to the men of Seir, set them up as his own gods, worshipped them, and sacrificed offerings to them. ", "15": "As a result, the Lord became angry with Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, who asked him, \u201cWhy did you seek the gods of a people who were unable to deliver their own nation from you?\u201d", "16": "But even while the prophet[d] was speaking, the king asked him, \u201cDid we appoint you to be a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?\u201d So the prophet stopped speaking, but he also said, \u201cI know God has determined to destroy you, because you've done all this and ignored my counsel.\u201d", "17": "After this, King Amaziah of Judah sought some advice and then challenged Jehoahaz' son King Joash of Israel, the grandson of Jehu, telling him, \u201cCome out and let's fight each other!\u201d", "18": "But King Joash of Israel replied to King Amaziah of Judah, \u201cThere once was a thorn bush in Lebanon that sent an invitation to the cedar of Lebanon that read 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Right about then, a wild animal in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thorn bush. ", "19": "You claim you've defeated Edom, but you're really only puffed up with arrogant boasting. So stay home. Why stir up trouble so you die, and the rest of Judah with you?\u201d", "20": "But Amaziah refused to listen, because the situation was being orchestrated by God in order to turn them over to the control of their enemies because they had pursued those Edomite gods. ", "21": "So King Joash of Israel went out to battle against King Amaziah of Judah, and they fought at Beth-shemesh, which is part of Judah's territory. ", "22": "Judah was defeated by Israel, and every soldier ran home. ", "23": "King Joash of Israel captured Joash's son King Amaziah of Judah, the grandson of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh and brought him back to Jerusalem, where he broke down 400 cubits[e] of the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. ", "24": "He confiscated all the gold, silver, and utensils that he could find in the care of Obed-edom inside of God's Temple and inside the royal palace. Then he took some hostages and returned to Samaria.", "25": "Joash's son Amaziah, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoahaz' son Joash, king of Israel. ", "26": "The rest of Amaziah's accomplishments, from first to last, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel, are they not? ", "27": "From the time that Amaziah abandoned his seeking the Lord, some people conspired against him in Jerusalem, so he ran away to Lachish, but they pursued him to Lachish and killed him there. ", "28": "They brought him back on horses and buried him with his ancestors in the city of Judah."}

{"1": "As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire descended from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the Temple. ", "2": "The priests could not enter into the Temple because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's Temple. ", "3": "When all of the Israelis saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord resting[a] on the Temple, they bowed down with their faces[b] to the ground on the pavement, worshipped, and gave thanks to the Lord, \u201cBecause he is good; because his gracious love is eternal.\u201d", "4": "Then the king and all the people kept on offering sacrifices in the presence of the Lord. ", "5": "King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep, which is how[c] the king and all of the people dedicated God's Temple. ", "6": "The priests stood in waiting at their assigned places, along with the descendants of Levi who carried musical instruments used in service to the Lord that King David had made for giving thanks to the Lord\u2014because his gracious love is eternal\u2014whenever David, accompanied by priests[d] sounding trumpets, offered praises while all of Israel stood in the assembly.[e]", "7": "Solomon also dedicated the middle of the court in front of the Lord's Temple by offering there burnt offerings and fat from peace offerings because the bronze altar that Solomon had made could not contain the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and fat portion offerings. ", "8": "At that time Solomon also held a week-long festival attended by all of Israel. The assembly was very large, and included people from as far away as Lebo-hamath[f] to the Wadi[g] of Egypt.[h] ", "9": "On the day after the festival ended,[i] they convened a solemn assembly, because they had been dedicating the altar for seven days and observing the festival for seven days. ", "10": "On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, King Solomon[j] sent the people back home,[k] and they returned[l] rejoicing and in good spirits because of the goodness that the Lord had shown to David, to Solomon, and to his people Israel. ", "11": "And so Solomon completed the Lord's Temple, bringing to completion everything that he had planned on doing for the Lord's Temple and for his own palace.", "12": "Later, the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night and told him: \u201cI have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for a sacrificial temple to me. ", "13": "Whenever I close the skies so there is no rain, or whenever I command locusts to lay waste to the land, or whenever I send epidemics among my people, ", "14": "when my people humble themselves\u2014the ones who are called by my name\u2014and pray, seek me,[m] and turn away from their evil practices, I myself will listen from heaven, I will pardon their sins, and I will restore their land.", "15": "\u201cNow therefore my eyes will remain open and my ears will remain listening to the prayers that are offered in this place.

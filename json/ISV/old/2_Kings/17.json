As a result, the king of Assyria placed him under arrest and sent him to prison. ", "5": "After this, the king of Assyria invaded the entire land, approached Samaria, and began a three year siege. ", "6": "As a result, during the ninth year of the reign of[c] Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and took the Israelis off to Assyria, placing them in Halah, along the Habor River in Gozan, and in cities ruled by the Medes.", "7": "This happened because the Israelis had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt and from the domination[d] of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, because[e] they were fearing other gods, ", "8": "and because they were following[f] the rules of the nations whom the Lord had expelled before the Israelis and that the kings of Israel had practiced.", "9": "The Israelis practiced secret things that were not right, offending the Lord their God. In addition, they built high places for use by all their towns, watchtowers, and fortified cities.

They also practiced other[g] wickedness, provoking the Lord to become angry, ", "12": "and they served idols, a practice that the Lord had warned them, \u201cYou are not to do this.\u201d", "13": "Nevertheless, the Lord had warned both Israel and Judah by means[h] of every prophet and seer: \u201cTurn away from your evil practices[i] and keep my commandments and statutes according to the entire Law that I gave your ancestors and that I sent to you through my servants, the prophets.\u201d ", "14": "But they would not listen. Instead, they were stubborn,[j] just like their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God.

", "3": "The king stood beside a pillar and made a covenant in the presence of the Lord: to follow after the Lord, to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes with all of his heart and soul, and to carry out what was written in the covenant contained in the book. All the people consented to enter into the covenant.", "4": "The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the secondary order, and the doorkeepers to take out of the Lord's Temple all of the implements that had been crafted for Baal, for Asherah, and for every star in the heavens.

", "8": "Then he gathered together all the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places from Geba to Beer-sheba, where the priests had burned incense. He also demolished the high places of the gates that had been erected to the left as one enters the city gate\u2014that is, near the entrance operated by Joshua, the governor of the city. ", "9": "Nevertheless, the priests of the high places did not approach the Lord's altar in Jerusalem, but instead they ate unleavened bread given to them by their[d] relatives.", "10": "He also defiled Topheth, which is located in the Ben-hinnom Valley,[e] so that no one would force his son or daughter to pass through the fire in dedication to Molech.

He transported Jehoahaz off to Egypt, where he died. ", "35": "As a result, Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold tribute[p] to Pharaoh, but he passed on the costs to the inhabitants of the land in taxes, in keeping with Pharaoh's orders. He exacted the silver and gold from the people who lived in the land, from each according to his assessment, in order to pay it to Pharaoh Neco.

Oh, how near it is!", "2": "A day of doom and gloom, a day of clouds and shadows[b] like the dawn spreads out to cover the mountains\u2014 a people strong and robust. Never has there been anything like it, neither will anything follow to compare with[c] it, even through the lifetime of generation upon generation.\u201d[d]", "3": "\u201cA fire blazes in their presence, and behind them a conflagration rages. Before they come, the land is like the garden in Eden; after they leave, there is only a barren wasteland. Indeed, nothing escapes them.", "4": "As to their form, they're like horses; and like chariot horses, how they can[e] run!", "5": "They leap like the rumbling of chariots echoing from mountain tops, like the roar of wild fire that devours the chaff, as an army[f] firmly established in battle array.", "6": "The people are terrified in their presence; every face grows pale.[g]", "7": "They run like elite soldiers, climbing ramparts like men trained for war. Each man advances in proper order, never breaking rank.", "8": "Neither does a man crowd his fellow soldier;[h] each one marches in his own path. When they fall by the sword they are not injured.", "9": "They swarm through the city, running upon its ramparts.

For he is gracious and compassionate, slow to become angry, overflowing in gracious love, and grieves about this evil.", "14": "Who knows? He will turn back and relent, will he not, leaving behind a blessing, even a grain offering and drink offering for the Lord your God?\u201d", "15": "\u201cSound the ram's horn in Zion!

You will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has performed wonders specifically for you.

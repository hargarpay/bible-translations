A poisonous snake was forced out by the heat and attached itself to Paul's[b] hand. ", "4": "When the people who lived there saw the snake hanging from his hand, they told one another, \u201cThis man must be a murderer! He may have escaped from the sea, but Justice[c] won't let him live.\u201d ", "5": "But he shook the snake into the fire and wasn't harmed. ", "6": "They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.", "7": "The governor of the island, whose name was Publius, owned estates in that part of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us with great hospitality for three days. ", "8": "The father of Publius happened to be sick in bed with fever and dysentery.

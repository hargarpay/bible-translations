", "3": "As Saul[b] traveled along and was approaching Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him. ", "4": "He dropped to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, \u201cSaul, Saul! Why are you persecuting me?\u201d", "5": "He asked, \u201cWho are you, Lord?\u201d[c] The voice[d] said, \u201cI'm Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

", "2": "They were greatly disturbed that Peter and John[a] were teaching the people and announcing that Jesus had been resurrected[b] from the dead. ", "3": "So they arrested them and placed them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening. ", "4": "But many of those who heard their message believed, and the men grew to number about 5,000.", "5": "The next day, their rulers, elders, and scribes met in Jerusalem ", "6": "with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John,[c] Alexander, and the rest of the high priest's family.

", "2": "I am jealous of you with God's own jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to the Messiah.[a] ", "3": "However, I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds may somehow be lured away from sincere and pure[b] devotion to the Messiah.[c]", "4": "For if someone comes along and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or should you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you are all too willing to listen. ", "5": "I do not think I'm inferior in any way to those \u201csuper-apostles.\u201d ", "6": "Even though I may be untrained as an orator, I am not so in the field of knowledge.

", "8": "I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. ", "9": "When I was with you and needed something, I did not bother any of you, because our brothers who came from Macedonia supplied everything I needed.

", "15": "So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their doom[f] will match their deeds!", "16": "I will say it again: No one should think that I am a fool. But if you do, then treat me like a fool so that I can also boast a little. ", "17": "When I talk as a confident boaster, I am not talking with the Lord's authority but like a fool. ", "18": "Since many people boast in a fleshly way, I will do it, too. ", "19": "You are wise, so you will gladly be tolerant of fools. ", "20": "You tolerate anyone who makes you his slaves, devours what you have, takes what is yours, orders you around, or slaps your face!", "21": "I am ashamed to admit it, but we have been too weak for that.

Otherwise, some of you will fail[a] to reach it, ", "2": "because we have had the good news told to us as well as to them. But the message they heard did not help them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened to it. ", "3": "We who have believed are entering that rest, just as he has said, \u201cSo in my anger I swore a solemn oath that they would never enter my rest,\u201d[b] even though his actions had been finished since the creation[c] of the world.

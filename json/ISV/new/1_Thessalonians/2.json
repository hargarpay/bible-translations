{"1": "For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a waste of time. ", "2": "As you know, we suffered persecution and were mistreated in Philippi. Yet we were encouraged by our God to tell you his[a] gospel in spite of strong opposition. ", "3": "For our appeal to you[b] does not spring from deceit, impure motives, or trickery. ", "4": "Rather, because we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, we speak as we do, not trying to please people but God, who tests our motives.", "5": "As you know, we did not come with flattering words or with a scheme to make money. God is our witness! ", "6": "We did not seek praise from people\u2014from you or from anyone else\u2014 ", "7": "even though as apostles of the Messiah[c] we might have made such demands. Instead, we were gentle[d] among you, like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her own children. ", "8": "We cared so deeply for you that we were determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but our very lives. That is how dear you were to us. ", "9": "Brothers, you remember our labor and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you. ", "10": "You and God are witnesses of how pure, honest, and blameless our conduct was among you who believe. ", "11": "You know very well that we treated each of you the way a father treats[e] his children. ", "12": "We comforted and encouraged you, urging you to live in a manner worthy of God, who calls[f] you into his kingdom and glory.", "13": "Here is another reason why we constantly give thanks to God: When you received God's word, which you heard from us, you did not accept it as the word of humans but for what it really is\u2014the word of God, which is at work in you who believe. ", "14": "For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in union with the Messiah[g] Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from the people of your own country as they did from those Jews ", "15": "who killed the Lord Jesus and the[h] prophets, who have persecuted us, and who please neither God nor any group of people, ", "16": "as they try to keep us from telling the gentiles how they can be saved. As a result, they are constantly adding to the number of sins they have committed.[i] However, wrath has overtaken them at last!", "17": "Brothers, although we have been separated from you for a little while\u2014in person but not in heart\u2014we eagerly desire to see you again face to face. ", "18": "That is why we wanted to come to you. Certainly I, Paul, wanted to come[j] time and again, but Satan blocked our way. ", "19": "After all, who is our hope, joy, or reason for[k] rejoicing in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? It is you, isn't it? ", "20": "Yes, you are our glory and joy!"}

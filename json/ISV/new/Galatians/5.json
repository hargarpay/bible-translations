I, Paul, am telling you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, the Messiah[c] will be of no benefit to you. ", "3": "Again, I insist[d] that everyone who allows himself to be circumcised is obligated to obey the entire Law. ", "4": "Those of you who are trying to be justified by the Law have been cut off from the Messiah.[e] You have fallen away from grace.", "5": "Through the Spirit by faith we confidently await the fulfillment of our righteous hope, ", "6": "for in union with the Messiah[f] Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. What matters is faith[g] expressed through love.", "7": "You were running the race beautifully. Who cut in on you and stopped you from obeying the truth? ", "8": "Such influence does not come from the one who calls you. ", "9": "A little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough. ", "10": "I am confident[h] in the Lord that you will take no other view of this. However, the one who is troubling you will suffer God's[i] judgment, whoever he is.

", "12": "I wish that those who are upsetting you would castrate themselves!", "13": "For you, brothers, were called to freedom.

", "17": "For what the flesh wants is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, and so you do not do what you want to do. ", "18": "But if you are being led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.", "19": "Now the actions of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, promiscuity, ", "20": "idolatry, witchcraft,[l] hatred, rivalry, jealously, outbursts of anger, quarrels, conflicts, factions, ", "21": "envy, murder,[m] drunkenness, wild partying, and things like that. I am telling you now, as I have told you in the past, that people who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

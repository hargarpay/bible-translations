Or who takes care of a flock and does not drink any of its milk? ", "8": "I am not saying this on human authority, am I? The Law says the same thing, doesn't it?

I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for[f] boasting. ", "16": "For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for this obligation has been entrusted to me. How terrible it would be for me if I didn't preach the gospel! ", "17": "For if I preach voluntarily, I get a reward, but if I am unwilling to do it, I am still entrusted with that obligation.

First of all, the Jews[a] have been entrusted with the utterances of God. ", "3": "What if some of the Jews[b] were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness cannot cancel God's faithfulness, can it? ", "4": "Of course not! God is true, even if everyone else is a liar. As it is written, \u201cYou are right when you speak,[c] and win your case when you go into court.\u201d[d]", "5": "But if our unrighteousness serves to confirm God's righteousness, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his wrath on us, is he? (I am talking in human terms.) ", "6": "Of course not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?

", "5": "However, to someone who does not work, but simply believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness. ", "6": "Likewise, David also speaks of the blessedness of the person whom God regards as righteous apart from actions:", "7": "\u201cHow blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered!", "8": "How blessed is the person whose sins the Lord[b] will never charge against him!\u201d[c]", "9": "Now does this blessedness come to the circumcised alone, or also to the uncircumcised?

He had not yet been circumcised, but was uncircumcised. ", "11": "Afterward he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Therefore, he is the ancestor of all who believe while uncircumcised, in order that righteousness may be credited to them.

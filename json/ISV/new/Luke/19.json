", "3": "He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't do so due to the crowd, since he was a short man. ", "4": "So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus,[b] who was going to pass that way.", "5": "When Jesus came to the tree,[c] he looked up and said, \u201cZacchaeus, hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today.\u201d ", "6": "Zacchaeus[d] came down quickly and was glad to welcome him into his home.[e]", "7": "But all the people who saw this began to complain: \u201cJesus[f] is going to be the guest of a notorious[g] sinner!\u201d", "8": "Later, Zacchaeus stood up and announced to the Lord, \u201cLook! I'm giving half of my possessions to the destitute, and if I have accused anyone falsely, I'm repaying four times as much as I owe.\u201d[h]", "9": "Then Jesus told him, \u201cToday salvation has come to this home, because this man[i] is also a descendant of Abraham, ", "10": "and the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.\u201d", "11": "As they were listening to this, Jesus[j] went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and because the people[k] thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately. ", "12": "So he said, \u201cA prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return.

You knew, did you, that I was a hard man, and that I withdraw what I didn't deposit and harvest what I didn't plant? ", "23": "Then why didn't you put my money in the bank?

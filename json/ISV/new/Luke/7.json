", "7": "That's why I didn't presume to come to you. But just say the word, and let my servant be healed, ", "8": "because I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one 'Go' and he goes, to another 'Come' and he comes, and to my servant 'Do this' and he does it.\u201d", "9": "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him.

A woeful dirge we chanted, too, but then you would not mourn.'", "33": "Because John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, yet you say, 'He has a demon!'

{"1": "After this, Jesus[a] traveled from one city and village to another, preaching and spreading the good news about God's kingdom. The Twelve were with him, ", "2": "as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses: Mary, also called Magdalene,[b] from whom seven demons had gone out; ", "3": "Joanna, the wife of Herod's household manager Chuza; Susanna; and many others. These women[c] continued to support them[d] out of their personal resources.", "4": "Now while a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus[e] from every city, he said in a parable: ", "5": "\u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, were trampled on, and birds from the sky ate them up. ", "6": "Others fell on stony ground, and as soon as they came up, they dried up because they had no moisture. ", "7": "Others fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes grew with them and choked them. ", "8": "But others fell on good soil, and when they came up, they produced 100 times as much as was planted.\u201d As he said this, he called out, \u201cLet the person who has ears to hear, listen!\u201d", "9": "Then his disciples began to ask him what this parable meant. ", "10": "So he said, \u201cYou have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of God. But to others they are given[f] in parables, so that 'they might look but not see, and they might listen but not understand.'\u201d[g]", "11": "\u201cNow this is what the parable means. The seed is God's word. ", "12": "The ones on the path are the people who listen, but then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. ", "13": "The ones on the stony ground are the people who joyfully welcome the word when they hear it. But since they don't have any roots, they believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away. ", "14": "The ones that fell among the thorn bushes are the people who listen, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries, wealth, and pleasures of life, and their fruit doesn't mature. ", "15": "But the ones on the good soil are the people who hear the word but also hold on to it with good and honest hearts, producing a crop through endurance.\u201d", "16": "\u201cNo one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see the light. ", "17": "There is nothing hidden that won't be revealed, and there is nothing secret that won't become known and come to light. ", "18": "So pay attention to how you listen, because to the one who has something, more will be given. However, from the one who doesn't have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.\u201d", "19": "His mother and his brothers came to him, but they couldn't get near him because of the crowd. ", "20": "Jesus[h] was told, \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you.\u201d", "21": "But he answered those people,[i] \u201cMy mother and my brothers are those who hear a message from God and heed it.\u201d", "22": "One day, Jesus[j] and his disciples got into a boat. He told them, \u201cLet's cross to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they started out.", "23": "Now as they were sailing, Jesus[k] fell asleep. A violent storm swept over the lake, and they were taking on water and were in great danger. ", "24": "So his disciples[l] went to him, woke him up, and kept telling him, \u201cMaster! Master! We're going to die!\u201d He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. They stopped, and there was calm.", "25": "Then he asked the disciples,[m] \u201cWhere's your faith?\u201d Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, \u201cWho is this man? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!\u201d", "26": "They landed in the region of the Gerasenes,[n] which is just across the lake from Galilee. ", "27": "When Jesus[o] stepped out on the shore, a man from the city met him. This man was controlled by[p] demons and had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house but in the tombs.

I beg you not to torture me!\u201d ", "29": "because Jesus[q] was in the process of ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions the unclean spirit[r] had seized the man,[s] and though he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, he would break the chains and be driven by the demon into deserted places.", "30": "Jesus asked the man,[t] \u201cWhat's your name?\u201d He answered, \u201cLegion,\u201d[u] because many demons had gone into him.

", "35": "So the people[aa] went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened. ", "36": "The people who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed. ", "37": "Then all the people from the region surrounding the Gerasenes[ab] asked Jesus[ac] to leave them, because they were terrified. So he got into a boat and started back.", "38": "Now the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging Jesus[ad] to let him go with him. But Jesus[ae] sent him away, saying, ", "39": "\u201cGo home and tell what God has done for you.\u201d So the man[af] left and kept proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.", "40": "When Jesus came back, the crowd welcomed him, because everyone was expecting him.

He fell at Jesus' feet and kept begging him to come to his home, ", "42": "because his only living[ag] daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. While Jesus[ah] was on his way, the crowds continued to press in on him.", "43": "A woman was there[ai] who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. Although she had spent all she had on doctors,[aj] no one could heal her. ", "44": "She came up behind Jesus[ak] and touched the tassel of his garment, and her bleeding stopped at once.", "45": "Jesus asked, \u201cWho touched me?\u201d While everyone was denying it, Peter and those who were with him[al] said, \u201cMaster, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you.\u201d", "46": "Still Jesus said, \u201cSomebody touched me, because I know that power has gone out of me.\u201d", "47": "When the woman saw that she couldn't hide, she came forward trembling. Bowing down in front of him, she explained in the presence of all the people why she had touched Jesus[am] and how she had been instantly healed.

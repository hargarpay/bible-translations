{"1": "After Jesus had said all of this, he went with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. ", "2": "Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. ", "3": "So Judas took a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the high priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen, went forward and asked them, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d", "5": "They answered him, \u201cJesus from Nazareth.\u201d[a] Jesus told them, \u201cI AM.\u201d Judas, the man who betrayed him, was standing with them.", "6": "When Jesus[b] told them, \u201cI AM,\u201d they backed away and fell to the ground.", "7": "So he asked them again, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d They said, \u201cJesus from Nazareth.\u201d[c]", "8": "Jesus replied, \u201cI told you that I am the one,[d] so if you are looking for me, let these men go.\u201d ", "9": "This was to fulfill what he had said, \u201cI did not lose a single one of those you gave me.\u201d[e]", "10": "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. ", "11": "Jesus told Peter, \u201cPut your sword back into its sheath. Shouldn't I drink the cup that the Father has given me?\u201d", "12": "Then the soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officers, arrested Jesus and tied him up. ", "13": "First they brought him to Annas, because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. ", "14": "Caiaphas was the person who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one man die for the people.", "15": "Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since the other disciple was known to the high priest, he accompanied Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. ", "16": "Peter, however, stood outside the gate. So this other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter inside. ", "17": "The young woman at the gate asked Peter, \u201cYou aren't one of this man's disciples, too, are you?\u201d \u201cI am not,\u201d he replied.", "18": "Meanwhile, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had built and were warming themselves because it was cold. Peter was also standing with them, keeping himself warm.", "19": "Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching. ", "20": "Jesus answered him, \u201cI have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue or in the Temple, where all Jews meet together, and I have said nothing in secret. ", "21": "Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said. These are the people who know what I said.\u201d", "22": "When he said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Jesus on the face and demanded, \u201cIs that any way to answer the high priest?\u201d", "23": "Jesus answered him, \u201cIf I have said anything wrong, tell me what it was.[f] But if I have told the truth, why do you hit me?\u201d ", "24": "Then Annas sent him, with his hands tied, to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Meanwhile, Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Some people[g] asked him, \u201cYou aren't one of his disciples, too, are you?\u201d He denied it by saying, \u201cI am not!\u201d", "26": "Then one of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \u201cI saw you in the garden with Jesus,[h] didn't I?\u201d ", "27": "Peter again denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.", "28": "Then Jesus was led from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters[i] early in the morning. The Jews[j] did not go into the headquarters, to avoid becoming unclean[k] and unable to eat the Passover meal. ", "29": "So Pilate came out to them and asked, \u201cWhat accusation are you bringing against this man?\u201d", "30": "They answered him, \u201cIf he weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you.\u201d", "31": "Pilate told them, \u201cYou take him and try him according to your Law.\u201d The Jewish leaders[l] told him, \u201cIt is not legal for us to put anyone to death.\u201d ", "32": "This was to fulfill what Jesus had said[m] when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.", "33": "So Pilate went back into the governor's headquarters,[n] summoned Jesus, and asked him, \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d", "34": "Jesus replied, \u201cAre you asking this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about me?\u201d", "35": "Pilate replied, \u201cI am not a Jew, am I? It is your own nation and high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?\u201d", "36": "Jesus answered, \u201cMy kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my servants would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders.[o] But for now my kingdom is not from here.\u201d", "37": "Pilate asked him, \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou say that I am a king. I was born for this, and I came into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is committed to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d", "38": "Pilate asked him, \u201cWhat is 'truth'?\u201d and then he went out to the Jewish leaders[p] again and told them, \u201cI find no basis for a charge against him. ", "39": "But you have a custom that I release one person for you at Passover. Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?\u201d", "40": "At this, they shouted out again, \u201cNot this fellow, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.[q]"}

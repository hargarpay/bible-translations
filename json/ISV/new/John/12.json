He was in charge of the moneybag and would steal what was put into it.", "7": "Then Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone so she can observe the day of my burial, ", "8": "because you will always have the destitute with you, but you won't always have me.\u201d", "9": "When the large crowd of Jews realized that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

{"1": "My brothers, do not let your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus, the Messiah,[a] be tainted by favoritism. ", "2": "Suppose a man wearing gold rings and fine clothes comes into your assembly,[b] and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in. ", "3": "If you give special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, \u201cPlease take this seat,\u201d but you say to the poor man, \u201cStand over there\u201d or \u201cSit on the floor at my feet,\u201d[c] ", "4": "then you will have made false distinctions among yourselves and will have judged from evil motives, will you not?", "5": "Listen, my dear brothers! God has chosen the poor in the world to become rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who keep on loving him, has he not? ", "6": "But you have humiliated the man who is poor. Are not rich people the ones who oppress you and drag you into court? ", "7": "Are not they the ones who blaspheme the noble Name[d] by which you have been called?", "8": "Nevertheless, you are doing the right thing if you obey the royal Law in keeping with the Scripture, \u201cYou must love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d[e] ", "9": "But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and will be convicted by the Law as violators. ", "10": "For whoever keeps the whole Law but fails in one point is guilty of breaking all of it. ", "11": "For the one who said, \u201cNever commit adultery,\u201d[f] also said, \u201cNever murder.\u201d[g] Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you become a violator of the Law. ", "12": "You must make it your habit to speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty. ", "13": "For the one who has shown no mercy will be judged without mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.", "14": "What good does it do, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not prove it with actions? This kind of faith cannot save him, can it? ", "15": "Suppose a brother or sister does not have any clothes or daily food ", "16": "and one of you tells them, \u201cGo in peace! Stay warm and eat heartily.\u201d If you do not provide for their bodily needs, what good does it do? ", "17": "In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not prove itself with actions, is dead.", "18": "But someone may say, \u201cYou have faith, and I have actions.\u201d Show me your faith without any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.

", "2": "He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said, ", "3": "\u201cListen! A farmer went out to sow. ", "4": "As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up. ", "5": "Others fell on stony ground, where they didn't have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once, because the soil wasn't deep. ", "6": "But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they didn't have any roots, they dried up. ", "7": "Others fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes came up and choked them out, and they didn't produce anything. ", "8": "But others fell on good soil and produced a crop. They grew up, increased in size, and produced 30, 60, or 100 times what was sown.\u201d[c] ", "9": "He added, \u201cLet the person who has ears to hear, listen!\u201d", "10": "When he was alone with the Twelve and those around him, they began to ask him about the parables. ", "11": "He told them, \u201cThe secret about the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything comes in parables ", "12": "so that 'they may see clearly but not perceive, and they may hear clearly but not understand, otherwise they might turn around and be forgiven.'\u201d[d]", "13": "Then he told them, \u201cYou don't understand this parable, so how can you understand any of the parables? ", "14": "The farmer sows the word. ", "15": "Some people are like the seeds[e] along the path, where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. ", "16": "Others are like the seeds[f] sown on the stony ground. When they hear the word, at once they joyfully accept it, ", "17": "but since they don't have any roots, they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall away. ", "18": "Still others are like the seeds[g] sown among the thorn bushes. These are the people who hear the word, ", "19": "but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can't produce a crop. ", "20": "Others are like the seeds[h] sown on good soil. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops\u201430, 60, or 100 times what was sown.\u201d[i]", "21": "Then Jesus[j] told them, \u201cA lamp isn't brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it?

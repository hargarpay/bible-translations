Otherwise, there'll be a riot among the people.\u201d", "3": "While Jesus[a] was in Bethany sitting at the table in the home of Simon the leper, a woman arrived with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on his head. ", "4": "Irritated, some who were there asked one another, \u201cWhy was the perfume wasted like this? ", "5": "This perfume could have been sold for more than 300 denarii[b] and the money[c] given to the destitute.\u201d So they got extremely angry with her.", "6": "But Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me, ", "7": "because you'll always have the destitute with you and can help them whenever you want, but you won't always have me. ", "8": "She has done what she could. She poured perfume on my body in preparation for my burial. ", "9": "I tell all of you[d] with certainty, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.\u201d", "10": "Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the high priests to betray Jesus[e] to them.

", "15": "Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished and ready. Get everything ready for us there.\u201d ", "16": "So the disciples left and went into the city. They found everything just as Jesus[j] had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.", "17": "When evening came, Jesus[k] arrived with the Twelve. ", "18": "While they were at the table eating, Jesus said, \u201cI tell all of you[l] with certainty, one of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me.\u201d", "19": "They began to be very sad and asked him, one after the other, \u201cSurely I am not the one, am I?\u201d", "20": "He told them, \u201cIt's one of you Twelve, the one who is dipping his bread into the bowl with me. ", "21": "For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!

The spirit is indeed willing, but the body[t] is weak.\u201d", "39": "He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before.[u] ", "40": "Again he came back and found them asleep, because they could not keep their eyes open.

The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. ", "42": "Get up! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!\u201d", "43": "Just then, while Jesus[w] was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him.

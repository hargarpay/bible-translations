", "3": "(The Pharisees\u2014and indeed all the Jewish people\u2014don't eat unless they wash their hands properly,[c] following the tradition of their elders. ", "4": "They don't eat anything from the marketplace unless they dip it in water. They also observe many other traditions, such as the proper washing of washing cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)[d] ", "5": "So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus,[e] \u201cWhy don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat[f] with unclean hands.\u201d", "6": "He told them, \u201cIsaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites.

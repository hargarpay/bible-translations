{"1": "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.[a] ", "2": "For the law of the life-giving Spirit[b] in Christ Jesus has set you[c] free from the law of sin and death. ", "3": "For God achieved what the law could not do because[d] it was weakened through the flesh. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, ", "4": "so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.", "5": "For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by[e] the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit. ", "6": "For the outlook[f] of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace, ", "7": "because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so. ", "8": "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. ", "9": "You, however, are not in[g] the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person does not belong to him. ", "10": "But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but[h] the Spirit is your life[i] because of righteousness. ", "11": "Moreover if the Spirit of the one[j] who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ[k] from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his Spirit who lives in you.[l]", "12": "So then,[m] brothers and sisters,[n] we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh ", "13": "(for if you live according to the flesh, you will[o] die),[p] but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. ", "14": "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are[q] the sons of God. ", "15": "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear,[r] but you received the Spirit of adoption,[s] by whom[t] we cry, \u201cAbba,[u] Father.\u201d ", "16": "The Spirit himself bears witness to[v] our spirit that we are God's children. ", "17": "And if children, then heirs (namely, heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ)[w]\u2014if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him.", "18": "For I consider that our present sufferings cannot even be compared[x] to the coming glory that will be revealed to us.

", "22": "For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together until now. ", "23": "Not only this, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,[z] groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption,[aa] the redemption of our bodies.[ab] ", "24": "For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees?

It[b] had ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns were ten diadem crowns,[c] and on its heads a blasphemous name.[d] ", "2": "Now[e] the beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The[f] dragon gave the beast[g] his power, his throne, and great authority to rule.[h] ", "3": "One of the beast's[i] heads appeared to have been killed,[j] but the lethal wound had been healed.[k] And the whole world followed[l] the beast in amazement; ", "4": "they worshiped the dragon because he had given ruling authority[m] to the beast, and they worshiped the beast too, saying: \u201cWho is like the beast?\u201d and \u201cWho is able to make war against him?\u201d[n] ", "5": "The beast[o] was given a mouth speaking proud words[p] and blasphemies, and he was permitted[q] to exercise ruling authority[r] for forty-two months.

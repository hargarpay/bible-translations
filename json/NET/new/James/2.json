", "6": "But you have dishonored the poor![m] Are not the rich oppressing you and dragging you into the courts? ", "7": "Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to?[n] ", "8": "But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture,[o] \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself,\u201d[p] you are doing well.

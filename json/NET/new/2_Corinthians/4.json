{"1": "Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as God has shown us mercy,[a] we do not become discouraged.[b] ", "2": "But we have rejected[c] shameful hidden deeds,[d] not behaving[e] with deceptiveness[f] or distorting the word of God, but by open proclamation of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience before God. ", "3": "But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing, ", "4": "among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe[g] so they would not see the light of the glorious gospel[h] of Christ,[i] who is the image of God. ", "5": "For we do not proclaim[j] ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves[k] for Jesus' sake. ", "6": "For God, who said \u201cLet light shine out of darkness,\u201d[l] is the one who shined in our hearts to give us the light of the glorious knowledge[m] of God in the face of Christ.[n]", "7": "But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the extraordinary power[o] belongs to God and does not come from us.

{"1": "For we know that if our earthly house, the tent we live in,[a] is dismantled,[b] we have a building from God, a house not built by human hands, that is eternal in the heavens. ", "2": "For in this earthly house[c] we groan, because we desire to put on[d] our heavenly dwelling, ", "3": "if indeed, after we have put on[e] our heavenly house,[f] we will not be found naked. ", "4": "For we groan while we are in this tent,[g] since we are weighed down,[h] because we do not want to be unclothed, but clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. ", "5": "Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose[i] is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment.[j] ", "6": "Therefore we are always full of courage, and we know that as long as we are alive here on earth[k] we are absent from the Lord\u2014", "7": "for we live[l] by faith, not by sight. ", "8": "Thus we are full of courage and would prefer to be away[m] from the body and at home with the Lord. ", "9": "So then whether we are alive[n] or away, we make it our ambition to please him.[o] ", "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,[p] so that each one may be paid back according to what he has done while in the body, whether good or evil.[q]", "11": "Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord,[r] we try to persuade[s] people,[t] but we are well known[u] to God, and I hope we are well known to your consciences too. ", "12": "We are not trying to commend[v] ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us,[w] so that you may be able to answer those who take pride[x] in outward appearance[y] and not in what is in the heart. ", "13": "For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. ", "14": "For the love of Christ[z] controls us, since we have concluded this, that Christ[aa] died for all; therefore all have died. ", "15": "And he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised.[ab] ", "16": "So then from now on we acknowledge[ac] no one from an outward human point of view.[ad] Even though we have known Christ from such a human point of view,[ae] now we do not know him in that way any longer. ", "17": "So then, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; what is old has passed away[af]\u2014look, what is new[ag] has come![ah] ", "18": "And all these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation. ", "19": "In other words, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people's trespasses against them, and he has given us[ai] the message of reconciliation. ", "20": "Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his plea[aj] through us. We plead with you[ak] on Christ's behalf, \u201cBe reconciled to God!\u201d ", "21": "God[al] made the one who did not know sin[am] to be sin for us, so that in him[an] we would become the righteousness of God."}

", "6": "For even if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I would be telling[e] the truth, but I refrain from this so that no one may regard[f] me beyond what he sees in me or what he hears from me, ", "7": "even because of the extraordinary character of the revelations. Therefore,[g] so that I would not become arrogant, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to trouble[h] me\u2014so that I would not become arrogant.[i] ", "8": "I asked the Lord three times about this, that it would depart from me.

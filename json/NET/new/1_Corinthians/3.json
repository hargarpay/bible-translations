", "2": "I fed you milk,[c] not solid food, for you were not yet ready. In fact, you are still not ready, ", "3": "for you are still influenced by the flesh.[d] For since there is still jealousy and dissension among you, are you not influenced by the flesh and behaving like unregenerate people?[e] ", "4": "For whenever someone says, \u201cI am with Paul,\u201d or \u201cI am with Apollos,\u201d are you not merely human?[f]", "5": "What is Apollos, really? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, and each of us in the ministry the Lord gave us.[g] ", "6": "I planted,[h] Apollos watered, but God caused it to grow. ", "7": "So neither the one who plants counts for anything,[i] nor the one who waters, but God who causes the growth. ", "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters work as one,[j] but each will receive his reward according to his work. ", "9": "We are coworkers belonging to God.[k] You are God's field, God's building. ", "10": "According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation, but someone else builds on it. And each one must be careful how he builds. ", "11": "For no one can lay any foundation other than what is being laid, which is Jesus Christ. ", "12": "If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,[l] ", "13": "each builder's[m] work will be plainly seen, for the Day[n] will make it clear, because it will be revealed by fire. And the fire[o] will test what kind of work each has done. ", "14": "If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward. ", "15": "If someone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss.[p] He himself will be saved, but only as through fire.", "16": "Do you not know that you are God's temple[q] and that God's Spirit lives in you?

For God's temple is holy, which is what you are.", "18": "Guard against self-deception, each of you.[r] If someone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become foolish so that he can become wise. ", "19": "For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. As it is written, \u201cHe catches the wise in their craftiness.\u201d[s] ", "20": "And again, \u201cThe Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.\u201d[t] ", "21": "So then, no more boasting about mere mortals![u] For everything belongs to you, ", "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas[v] or the world or life or death or the present or the future. Everything belongs to you, ", "23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."}

", "2": "For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But the message they heard did them no good, since they did not join in[b] with those who heard it in faith.[c] ", "3": "For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, \u201cAs I swore in my anger, 'They will never enter my rest!'\u201d[d] And yet God's works[e] were accomplished from the foundation of the world. ", "4": "For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: \u201cAnd God rested on the seventh day from all his works,\u201d[f] ", "5": "but to repeat the text cited earlier:[g] \u201cThey will never enter my rest!\u201d ", "6": "Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience.

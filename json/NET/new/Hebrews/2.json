", "2": "For if the message spoken through angels[a] proved to be so firm that every violation[b] or disobedience received its just penalty, ", "3": "how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, ", "4": "while God confirmed their witness[c] with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed[d] according to his will.", "5": "For he did not put the world to come,[e] about which we are speaking,[f] under the control of angels. ", "6": "Instead someone testified somewhere: \u201cWhat is man that you think of him[g] or the son of man that you care for him?", "7": "You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You crowned him with glory and honor.[h]", "8": "You put all things under his control.\u201d[i] For when he put all things under his control, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see all things under his control,[j] ", "9": "but we see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while,[k] now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death,[l] so that by God's grace he would experience[m] death on behalf of everyone.

Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?

What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves?[aa] God has exposed the sin of your servants![ab] We are now my lord's slaves, we and the one in whose possession the cup was found.\u201d", "17": "But Joseph said, \u201cFar be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found will become my slave, but the rest of[ac] you may go back[ad] to your father in peace.\u201d", "18": "Then Judah approached him and said, \u201cMy lord, please allow your servant to speak a word with you.[ae] Please do not get angry with your servant,[af] for you are just like Pharaoh.[ag] ", "19": "My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'

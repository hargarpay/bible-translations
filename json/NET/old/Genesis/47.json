There is no[f] pasture for your servants' flocks because the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.\u201d", "5": "Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cYour father and your brothers have come to you.

If you know of any highly capable men[g] among them, put them in charge[h] of my livestock.\u201d", "7": "Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him[i] before Pharaoh. Jacob blessed[j] Pharaoh. ", "8": "Pharaoh said to Jacob, \u201cHow long have you lived?\u201d[k] ", "9": "Jacob said to Pharaoh, \u201cAll[l] the years of my travels[m] are 130. All[n] the years of my life have been few and painful;[o] the years of my travels are not as long as those of my ancestors.\u201d[p] ", "10": "Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.[q]", "11": "So Joseph settled his father and his brothers. He gave them territory[r] in the land of Egypt, in the best region of the land, the land of Rameses,[s] just as Pharaoh had commanded.

Then Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's palace.[v] ", "15": "When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was used up, all the Egyptians[w] came to Joseph and said, \u201cGive us food! Why should we die[x] before your very eyes because our money has run out?\u201d", "16": "Then Joseph said, \u201cIf your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food[y] in exchange for[z] your livestock.\u201d ", "17": "So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys.[aa] He got them through that year by giving them food in exchange for all their livestock.", "18": "When that year was over, they came to him the next year and said to him, \u201cWe cannot hide from our[ab] lord that the money is used up and the livestock and the animals belong to our lord.

That is why they did not sell their land.", "23": "Joseph said to the people, \u201cSince I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Cultivate[ak] the land.

Esther also was taken to the royal palace[q] to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women. ", "9": "This young woman pleased him,[r] and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven specially chosen[s] young women who were from the palace.

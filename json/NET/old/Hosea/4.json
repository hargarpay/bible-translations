They resort to violence and bloodshed.[e]", "3": "Therefore the land will mourn, and all its inhabitants will perish.[f] The wild animals,[g] the birds of the sky, and even the fish in the sea will perish.", "4": "Do not let anyone accuse or contend against anyone else:[h] for my case is against you priests![i]", "5": "You stumble day and night, and the false prophets stumble with you; you have destroyed your own people.[j]", "6": "You have destroyed[k] my people by failing to acknowledge me! Because you refuse to acknowledge me,[l] I will reject you as my priests. Because you reject[m] the law of your God, I will reject[n] your descendants.", "7": "The more the priests increased in numbers, the more they rebelled against me. They have turned[o] their glorious calling into a shameful disgrace!", "8": "They feed on the sin offerings of my people; their appetites long for their iniquity!", "9": "I will deal with the people and priests together:[p] I will punish them both for their ways, and I will repay them for their deeds.", "10": "They will eat, but not be satisfied; they will engage in prostitution, but not increase in numbers; because they have abandoned the Lord by pursuing other gods.[q]", "11": "Old and new wine take away the understanding of my people.[r]", "12": "They consult their wooden idols, and their diviner's staff answers with an oracle.

As a result, your daughters have become cult prostitutes, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery!", "14": "I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery. For the men consort with harlots, they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. It is true:[u] \u201cA people that lacks understanding will come to ruin!\u201d", "15": "Although you, O Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty! Do not journey to Gilgal. Do not go up to Beth Aven.[v] Do not swear, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives!\u201d", "16": "Israel has rebelled[w] like a stubborn heifer! Soon[x] the Lord will put them out to pasture like a lamb in a broad field.[y]", "17": "Ephraim has attached himself to idols; Do not go near him!", "18": "They consume their alcohol, then engage in cult prostitution; they dearly love their shameful behavior.", "19": "A whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings; they will be brought to shame because of their idolatrous worship.[z]"}

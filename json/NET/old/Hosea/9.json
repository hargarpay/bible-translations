{"1": "O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly[a] like the nations, for you are unfaithful[b] to your God. You love to receive a prostitute's wages[c] on all the floors where you thresh your grain.", "2": "Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people,[d] and new wine only deceives them.[e]", "3": "They will not remain in the Lord's land. Ephraim will return to Egypt; they will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria.", "4": "They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the Lord; they will not please him with their sacrifices. Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning; all those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean. For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite; it will not come into the temple of the Lord.", "5": "So what will you do on the festival day, on the festival days of the Lord?", "6": "Look![f] Even if[g] they flee from the destruction, Egypt will take hold of[h] them, and Memphis will bury them. The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure[i]\u2014 thorn bushes will occupy their homes.[j]", "7": "The time of judgment[k] is about to arrive![l] The time of retribution[m] is imminent![n] Israel will be humbled![o] The prophet is considered a fool[p]\u2014 the inspired man[q] is viewed as a madman[r]\u2014 because of the multitude of your sins and your intense[s] animosity.", "8": "The prophet[t] is a watchman[u] over Ephraim[v] on behalf of God,[w] yet traps[x] are laid for him along all his paths;[y] animosity rages against him in the land[z] of his God.", "9": "They have sunk deep into corruption[aa] as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their wrongdoing. He will repay them for their sins.", "10": "When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness. I viewed your ancestors[ab] like an early fig on a fig tree in its first season. Then they came to Baal Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame\u2014 they became as detestable as what they loved.", "11": "Ephraim will be like a bird; what they value[ac] will fly away. They will not bear children\u2014 they will not enjoy pregnancy\u2014 they will not even conceive![ad]", "12": "Even if they raise their children, I will take away every last one of them.[ae] Woe to them! For I will turn away from them.", "13": "Ephraim, as I have seen, has given their children for prey;[af] Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter.", "14": "Give them, O Lord\u2014 what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry, and breasts that cannot nurse![ag]", "15": "Because of all their evil in Gilgal, I hate them there. On account of their evil deeds, I will drive them out of my land.[ah] I will no longer love them; all their rulers are rebels.", "16": "Ephraim will be struck down[ai]\u2014 their root will be dried up; they will not yield any fruit. Even if they do bear children, I will kill their precious offspring.", "17": "My God will reject them, for they have not obeyed him; so they will be fugitives among the nations."}

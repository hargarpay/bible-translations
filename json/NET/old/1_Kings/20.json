{"1": "Now King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled all his army, along with thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria and besieged and attacked it.[a] ", "2": "He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was in the city.[b] He said to him, \u201cThis is what Ben Hadad says: ", "3": "'Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and sons.'\u201d ", "4": "The king of Israel replied, \u201cIt is just as you say, my master, O king. I and all I own belong to you.\u201d", "5": "The messengers came again and said, \u201cThis is what Ben Hadad says: 'I sent this message to you, \u201cYou must give me your silver, gold, wives, and sons.\u201d ", "6": "But now at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you and they will search through your palace and your servants' houses. They will carry away all your valuables.'\u201d[c] ", "7": "The king of Israel summoned all the leaders[d] of the land and said, \u201cNotice how this man is looking for trouble.[e] Indeed, he demanded my wives, sons, silver, and gold, and I did not resist him.\u201d ", "8": "All the leaders and people said to him, \u201cDo not give in or agree to his demands.\u201d[f] ", "9": "So he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, \u201cSay this to my master, the king: 'I will give you everything you demanded at first from your servant, but I am unable to agree to this latest demand.'\u201d[g] So the messengers went back and gave their report.", "10": "Ben Hadad sent another message to him, \u201cMay the gods judge me severely[h] if there is enough dirt left in Samaria for all my soldiers to scoop up in their hands.\u201d[i] ", "11": "The king of Israel replied, \u201cTell him the one who puts on his battle gear should not boast like one who is taking it off.\u201d[j] ", "12": "When Ben Hadad received this reply,[k] he and the other kings were drinking in their quarters.[l] He ordered his servants, \u201cGet ready to attack!\u201d So they got ready to attack the city.", "13": "Now a prophet visited King Ahab of Israel and said, \u201cThis is what the Lord has said: 'Do you see this huge army?[m] Look, I am going to hand it over to you this very day. Then you will know that I am the Lord.'\u201d", "14": "Ahab asked, \u201cBy whom will this be accomplished?\u201d[n] He answered, \u201cThis is what the Lord has said, 'By the servants of the district governors.'\u201d Ahab[o] asked, \u201cWho will launch the attack?\u201d He answered, \u201cYou will.\u201d", "15": "So Ahab[p] assembled the 232 servants of the district governors. After that he assembled all the Israelite army, numbering 7,000.

When Ben Hadad sent messengers, they reported back to him, \u201cMen are marching out of Samaria.\u201d ", "18": "He ordered, \u201cWhether they come in peace or to do battle, take them alive.\u201d[s] ", "19": "They marched out of the city with the servants of the district governors in the lead and the army behind them. ", "20": "Each one struck down an enemy soldier;[t] the Syrians fled and Israel chased them. King Ben Hadad of Syria escaped on horseback with some horsemen. ", "21": "Then the king of Israel marched out and struck down the horses and chariots; he thoroughly defeated[u] Syria.", "22": "The prophet[v] visited the king of Israel and instructed him, \u201cGo, fortify your defenses.[w] Determine[x] what you must do, for in the spring[y] the king of Syria will attack[z] you.\u201d ", "23": "Now the advisers[aa] of the king of Syria said to him: \u201cTheir God is a god of the mountains. That's why they overpowered us. But if we fight them in the plains, we will certainly overpower them. ", "24": "So do this: Dismiss the kings from their command, and replace them with military commanders. ", "25": "Muster an army like the one you lost, with the same number of horses and chariots.[ab] Then we will fight them in the plains; we will certainly overpower them.\u201d He approved their plan and did as they advised.[ac]", "26": "In the spring[ad] Ben Hadad mustered the Syrian army[ae] and marched to Aphek to fight Israel.[af] ", "27": "When the Israelites had mustered and received their supplies, they marched out to face them in battle. When the Israelites deployed opposite them, they were like two small flocks[ag] of goats, but the Syrians filled the land. ", "28": "The prophet[ah] visited the king of Israel and said, \u201cThis is what the Lord has said: 'Because the Syrians said, \u201cThe Lord is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,\u201d I will deliver this entire huge army into to your control. Then you will know that I am the Lord.'", "29": "The armies were deployed opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began, and the Israelites killed 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day. ", "30": "The remaining 27,000 ran to Aphek and went into the city, but the wall fell on them.[ai] Now Ben Hadad ran into the city and hid in an inner room.[aj] ", "31": "His advisers[ak] said to him, \u201cLook, we have heard that the kings of the Israelite dynasty are kind.[al] Allow us to put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads[am] and surrender[an] to the king of Israel. Maybe he will spare our lives.\u201d ", "32": "So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, \u201cYour servant[ao] Ben Hadad says, 'Please let me live!'\u201d Ahab[ap] replied, \u201cIs he still alive? He is my brother.\u201d[aq] ", "33": "The men took this as a good omen and quickly accepted his offer, saying, \u201cBen Hadad is your brother.\u201d Ahab[ar] then said, \u201cGo, get him.\u201d So Ben Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up into his chariot. ", "34": "Ben Hadad[as] said, \u201cI will return the cities my father took from your father. You may set up markets[at] in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria.\u201d Ahab then said, \u201cI want to make a treaty with you before I dismiss you.\u201d[au] So he made a treaty with him and then dismissed him.", "35": "One of the members of the prophetic guild[av] told his companion a message from the Lord, \u201cPlease wound me!\u201d But the man refused to wound him. ", "36": "So the prophet[aw] said to him, \u201cBecause you have disobeyed the Lord, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you.\u201d When he left him, a lion attacked and killed him.

He also disguised himself by putting a bandage down over his eyes. ", "39": "When the king passed by, he called out to the king, \u201cYour servant went out into the heat[ay] of the battle, and then a man turned aside and brought me a prisoner.[az] He told me, 'Guard this prisoner. If he ends up missing for any reason,[ba] you will pay with your life or with a talent[bb] of silver.'[bc] ", "40": "Well, it just so happened that while your servant was doing this and that, he disappeared.\u201d The king of Israel said to him, \u201cYour punishment is already determined by your own testimony.\u201d[bd] ", "41": "The prophet[be] quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized he was one of the prophets. ", "42": "The prophet[bf] then said to him, \u201cThis is what the Lord has said: 'Because you released a man I had determined should die, you will pay with your life, and your people will suffer instead of his people.'\u201d[bg] ", "43": "The king of Israel went home to Samaria bitter and angry."}

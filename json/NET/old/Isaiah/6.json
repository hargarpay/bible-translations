With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet,[d] and they used the remaining two to fly. ", "3": "They called out to one another, \u201cHoly, holy, holy[e] is the Lord of Heaven's Armies![f] His majestic splendor fills the entire earth!\u201d ", "4": "The sound of their voices shook the door frames,[g] and the temple was filled with smoke.", "5": "I said, \u201cWoe to me! I am destroyed,[h] for my lips are contaminated by sin,[i] and I live among people whose lips are contaminated by sin.[j] My eyes have seen the king, the Lord of Heaven's Armies.\u201d[k] ", "6": "But then one of the seraphs flew toward me.

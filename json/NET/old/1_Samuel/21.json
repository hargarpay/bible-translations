{"1": "(21:2) David went to Ahimelech the priest in Nob. Ahimelech was shaking with fear when he met[a] David, and said to him, \u201cWhy are you by yourself with no one accompanying you?\u201d ", "2": "David replied to Ahimelech the priest, \u201cThe king instructed me to do something, but he said to me, 'Don't let anyone know the reason I am sending you or the instructions I have given you.'[b] I have told my soldiers[c] to wait at a certain place.[d] ", "3": "Now what do you have at your disposal?[e] Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.\u201d", "4": "The priest replied to David, \u201cI don't have any ordinary bread at my disposal. Only holy bread is available, and then only if your soldiers[f] have abstained from relations with women.\u201d[g] ", "5": "David said to the priest, \u201cCertainly women have been kept away from us, just as on previous occasions when I have set out. The soldiers'[h] equipment[i] is holy, even on an ordinary journey. How much more so will they be holy today, along with their equipment!\u201d", "6": "So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there other than the Bread of the Presence. It had been removed from before the Lord in order to replace it with hot bread on the day it had been taken away. ", "7": "(One of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the Lord. His name was Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's shepherds.) ", "8": "David said to Ahimelech, \u201cIs there no sword or spear here at your disposal? I don't have my own sword or equipment in hand due to the urgency of the king's instructions.\u201d", "9": "The priest replied, \u201cThe sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish, take it for yourself. Other than that one, there's no sword here.\u201d David said, \u201cThere's nothing like it. Give it to me.\u201d ", "10": "So on that day David arose and fled from Saul. He went to King Achish of Gath. ", "11": "The servants of Achish said to him, \u201cIsn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one that they sing about when they dance, saying, 'Saul struck down his thousands, but David his tens of thousands'?\u201d", "12": "David thought about what they said[j] and was very afraid of King Achish of Gath. ", "13": "He altered his behavior in their presence.[k] Since he was in their power,[l] he pretended to be insane, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard.", "14": "Achish said to his servants, \u201cLook at this madman! Why did you bring him to me? ", "15": "Do I have a shortage of fools so that you have brought me this man to display his insanity in front of me? Should this man enter my house?\u201d"}

{"1": "In his old age Samuel appointed his sons as judges over Israel. ", "2": "The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beer Sheba. ", "3": "But his sons did not follow[a] his ways. Instead, they made money dishonestly, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.[b]", "4": "So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah. ", "5": "They said to him, \u201cLook, you are old, and your sons don't follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead[c] us, just like all the other nations have.\u201d", "6": "But this request displeased Samuel, for[d] they said, \u201cGive us a king to lead us.\u201d So Samuel prayed to the Lord. ", "7": "The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDo everything the people request of you.[e] For it is not you that they have rejected, but it is me that they have rejected as their king. ", "8": "Just as they have done[f] from the day that I brought them up from Egypt until this very day, they have rejected me and have served other gods. This is what they are also doing to you. ", "9": "So now do as they say.[g] But you must warn[h] them and make them aware of the policies of the king who will rule over them.\u201d[i]", "10": "So Samuel spoke all the Lord's words to the people who were asking him for a king. ", "11": "He said, \u201cHere are the policies of the king who will rule over you: He will conscript your sons and put them in his chariot forces and in his cavalry; they will run in front of his chariot. ", "12": "He will appoint for himself leaders of thousands and leaders of fifties,[j] as well as those who plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and his chariot equipment. ", "13": "He will take your daughters to be ointment makers, cooks, and bakers. ", "14": "He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his own servants. ", "15": "He will demand a tenth of your seed and of the produce of your vineyards and give it to his administrators[k] and his servants. ", "16": "He will take your male and female servants, as well as your best cattle and your donkeys, and assign them for his own use. ", "17": "He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants. ", "18": "In that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord won't answer you in that day.\u201d[l]", "19": "But the people refused to heed Samuel's warning.[m] Instead they said, \u201cNo! There will be a king over us! ", "20": "We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us[n] and fight our battles.\u201d", "21": "So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the Lord.[o] ", "22": "The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDo as they say[p] and install a king over them.\u201d Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, \u201cEach of you go back to his own city.\u201d"}

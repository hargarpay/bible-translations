{"1": "Then Samuel said to Saul, \u201cI was the one the Lord sent to anoint you as king over his people Israel. Now listen to what the Lord says.[a] ", "2": "Here is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies has said: 'I carefully observed how the Amalekites opposed[b] Israel along the way when Israel[c] came up from Egypt. ", "3": "So go now and strike down the Amalekites. Destroy everything they have. Don't spare[d] them. Put them to death\u2014man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey alike.'\u201d", "4": "So Saul assembled[e] the army[f] and mustered them at Telaim. There were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. ", "5": "Saul proceeded to the city[g] of Amalek, where he set an ambush[h] in the wadi.[i] ", "6": "Saul said to the Kenites, \u201cGo on and leave! Go down from among the Amalekites. Otherwise I will sweep you away[j] with them. After all, you were kind to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.\u201d So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites.", "7": "Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to[k] Shur, which is next to Egypt. ", "8": "He captured King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he executed all Agag's people[l] with the sword. ", "9": "However, Saul and the army spared Agag, along with the best of the flock, the cattle, the fatlings,[m] and the lambs, as well as everything else that was of value.[n] They were not willing to slaughter them. But they did slaughter everything that was despised[o] and worthless.", "10": "Then the Lord's message came to Samuel: ", "11": "\u201cI regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not done what I told him to do.\u201d Samuel became angry and he cried out to the Lord all that night.", "12": "Then Samuel got up early to meet Saul the next morning. But Samuel was informed, \u201cSaul has gone to Carmel where[p] he is setting up a monument for himself.\u201d Then Samuel left[q] and went down to Gilgal.[r] ", "13": "When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, \u201cMay the Lord bless you! I have fulfilled the Lord's orders.\u201d[s]", "14": "Samuel replied, \u201cIf that is the case,[t] then what is this sound of sheep in my ears and the sound of cattle that I hear?\u201d ", "15": "Saul said, \u201cThey were brought[u] from the Amalekites; the army spared the best of the flocks and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord our God. But everything else we slaughtered.\u201d", "16": "Then Samuel said to Saul, \u201cWait a minute![v] Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.\u201d Saul[w] said to him, \u201cTell me.\u201d ", "17": "Samuel said, \u201cIs it not true that when you were insignificant in your own eyes, you became head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord chose[x] you as king over Israel. ", "18": "The Lord sent you on a campaign[y] saying, 'Go and exterminate those sinful Amalekites! Fight against them until you[z] have destroyed them.' ", "19": "Why haven't you obeyed[aa] the Lord? Instead you have greedily rushed upon the plunder! You have done what is wrong in the Lord's estimation.\u201d[ab]", "20": "Then Saul said to Samuel, \u201cBut I have obeyed[ac] the Lord! I went on the campaign[ad] the Lord sent me on. I brought back King Agag of the Amalekites after exterminating the Amalekites. ", "21": "But the army took from the plunder some of the sheep and cattle\u2014the best of what was to be slaughtered\u2014to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal.\u201d", "22": "Then Samuel said, \u201cDoes the Lord take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as he does in obedience?[ae] Certainly,[af] obedience[ag] is better than sacrifice; paying attention is better than[ah] the fat of rams.", "23": "For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and presumption is like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the Lord's orders,[ai] he has rejected you from being king.\u201d", "24": "Then Saul said to Samuel, \u201cI have sinned, for I have disobeyed what the Lord commanded[aj] and your words as well. For I was afraid of the army,[ak] and I obeyed their voice. ", "25": "Now please forgive my sin. Go back with me so I can worship the Lord.\u201d", "26": "Samuel said to Saul, \u201cI will not go back with you, for you have rejected the Lord's orders,[al] and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel!\u201d", "27": "When Samuel turned to leave, Saul[am] grabbed the edge of his robe and it tore.

But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel. Go back with me so I may worship the Lord your God.\u201d ", "31": "So Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the Lord.", "32": "Then Samuel said, \u201cBring me King Agag of the Amalekites.\u201d So Agag came to him trembling,[ar] thinking to himself,[as] \u201cSurely death is bitter!\u201d[at] ", "33": "Samuel said, \u201cJust as your sword left women childless, so your mother will be the most bereaved[au] among women.\u201d Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces there in Gilgal before the Lord.", "34": "Then Samuel went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. ", "35": "Until the day he[av] died, Samuel did not see Saul again. Samuel did, however, mourn for Saul, but the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."}

This pleased not only all the army, but also Saul's servants.[f]", "6": "When the men[g] arrived after David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women from all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing to meet King Saul. They were happy as they played their tambourines and three-stringed instruments.[h] ", "7": "The women who were playing the music sang, \u201cSaul has struck down his thousands, but David his tens of thousands!\u201d", "8": "This made Saul very angry. The statement displeased him and he thought,[i] \u201cThey have attributed to David tens of thousands, but to me they have attributed only thousands. What does he lack, except the kingdom?\u201d ", "9": "So Saul was keeping an eye on David from that day onward.", "10": "The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied[j] within his house.

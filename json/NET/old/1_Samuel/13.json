{"1": "Saul was [thirty][a] years old when he began to reign; he ruled over Israel for [forty][b] years. ", "2": "Saul selected for himself 3,000 men from Israel. Of these 2,000 were with Saul at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel; the remaining 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.[c] He sent all the rest of the people back home.[d]", "3": "Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost[e] that was at Geba and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul alerted[f] all the land saying, \u201cLet the Hebrews pay attention!\u201d ", "4": "All Israel heard this message,[g] \u201cSaul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel is repulsive[h] to the Philistines!\u201d So the people were summoned to join[i] Saul at Gilgal.", "5": "Meanwhile the Philistines gathered to battle with Israel. Then they went up against Israel[j] with 3,000 chariots,[k] 6,000 horsemen, and an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. ", "6": "The men of Israel realized they had a problem because their army was hard pressed. So the army hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, strongholds,[l] and cisterns. ", "7": "Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan River[m] to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul stayed at Gilgal; the entire army that was with him was terrified. ", "8": "He waited for seven days, the time period indicated by Samuel.[n] But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army began to abandon Saul.[o]", "9": "So Saul said, \u201cBring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.\u201d Then he offered a burnt offering. ", "10": "Just when he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared on the scene. Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.[p]", "11": "But Samuel said, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Saul replied, \u201cWhen I saw that the army had started to abandon me,[q] and that you didn't come at the appointed time, and that the Philistines had assembled at Micmash, ", "12": "I thought,[r] 'Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal and I have not sought the Lord's favor.' So I felt obligated[s] to offer the burnt offering.\u201d", "13": "Then Samuel said to Saul, \u201cYou have made a foolish choice! You have not obeyed[t] the commandment that the Lord your God gave[u] you. Had you done that, the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. ", "14": "But now your kingdom will not continue. The Lord has sought out[v] for himself a man who is loyal to him,[w] and the Lord has appointed[x] him to be leader over his people, for you have not obeyed what the Lord commanded you.\u201d", "15": "Then Samuel set out and went up from Gilgal[y] to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.[z] Saul mustered the army that remained with him; there were about 600 men.

", "21": "They charged[ac] two-thirds of a shekel[ad] to sharpen plowshares and cutting instruments, and one-third of a shekel[ae] to sharpen picks and axes, and to set ox goads. ", "22": "So on the day of the battle no sword or spear was to be found in the hand of anyone in the army that was with Saul and Jonathan. No one but Saul and his son Jonathan had them.", "23": "A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash."}

You will dispossess and destroy them quickly just as he[d] has told you. ", "4": "Do not think to yourself after the Lord your God has driven them out before you, \u201cBecause of my own righteousness the Lord has brought me here to possess this land.\u201d It is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out ahead of you.

Instead, because of the wickedness of these nations, the Lord your God is driving them out ahead of you in order to confirm the promise he[f] made on oath to your ancestors,[g] to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

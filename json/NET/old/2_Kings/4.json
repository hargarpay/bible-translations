Tell me, what do you have in the house?\u201d She answered, \u201cYour servant has nothing in the house except a small jar of olive oil.\u201d ", "3": "He said, \u201cGo and ask all your neighbors for empty containers.[d] Get as many as you can.[e] ", "4": "Go and close the door behind you and your sons. Pour the olive oil into all the containers;[f] set aside each one when you have filled it.\u201d ", "5": "So she left him and closed the door behind her and her sons. As they were bringing the containers to her, she was pouring the olive oil. ", "6": "When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons,[g] \u201cBring me another container.\u201d But he answered her, \u201cThere are no more.\u201d Then the olive oil stopped flowing.

Can I put in a good word for you with the king or the commander of the army?'\u201d She replied, \u201cI'm quite secure.\u201d[w] ", "14": "So he asked Gehazi,[x] \u201cWhat can I do for her?\u201d Gehazi replied, \u201cShe has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d ", "15": "Elisha told him, \u201cAsk her to come here.\u201d[y] So he did so[z] and she came and stood in the doorway.[aa] ", "16": "He said, \u201cAbout this time next year[ab] you will be holding a son.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, my master!

My head!\u201d His father[ad] told a servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d ", "20": "So he picked him up and took him to his mother. He sat on her lap[ae] until noon and then died.

It is not the new moon[ag] or the Sabbath.\u201d She said, \u201cEverything's fine.\u201d[ah] ", "24": "She saddled the donkey and told her servant, \u201cLead on.[ai] Do not stop unless I say so.\u201d[aj]", "25": "So she went to visit[ak] the prophet at Mount Carmel. When he[al] saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook, it's the Shunammite woman. ", "26": "Now, run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you well? Are your husband and the boy well?'\u201d She told Gehazi,[am] \u201cEverything's fine.\u201d ", "27": "But when she reached the prophet on the mountain, she grabbed hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the prophet said, \u201cLeave her alone, for she is very upset.[an] The Lord has kept the matter hidden from me; he didn't tell me about it.\u201d ", "28": "She said, \u201cDid I ask my master for a son?

As he bent down across him, the boy's skin[ax] grew warm. ", "35": "Elisha[ay] went back and walked around in the house.[az] Then he got up on the bed again[ba] and bent down over him. The child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. ", "36": "Elisha[bb] called to Gehazi and said, \u201cGet the Shunammite woman.\u201d So he did so[bc] and she came to him. He said to her, \u201cTake your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed down.

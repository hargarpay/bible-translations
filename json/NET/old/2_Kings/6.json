When they arrived at the Jordan, they started cutting down trees. ", "5": "As one of them was felling a tree, the ax head[d] dropped into the water. He shouted, \u201cOh no,[e] my master! It was borrowed!\u201d ", "6": "The prophet[f] asked, \u201cWhere did it drop in?\u201d When he showed him the spot, Elisha[g] cut off a branch, threw it in at that spot, and made the ax head float.

But she hid her son!\u201d ", "30": "When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his clothes. As he was passing by on the wall, the people could see he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.[ao] ", "31": "Then he said, \u201cMay God judge me severely[ap] if Elisha son of Shaphat still has his head by the end of the day!\u201d[aq]", "32": "Now Elisha was sitting in his house with the community leaders.[ar] The king[as] sent a messenger on ahead, but before he arrived,[at] Elisha[au] said to the leaders,[av] \u201cDo you realize this assassin intends to cut off my head?[aw] Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and lean against it.

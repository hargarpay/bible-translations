{"1": "Now Naaman, the commander of the king of Syria's army, was esteemed and respected by his master,[a] for through him the Lord had given Syria military victories. But this great warrior had a skin disease.[b] ", "2": "Raiding parties went out from Syria and took captive from the land of Israel a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman's wife. ", "3": "She told her mistress, \u201cIf only my master were in the presence of the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his skin disease.\u201d", "4": "Naaman[c] went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. ", "5": "The king of Syria said, \u201cGo! I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\u201d So Naaman[d] went, taking with him 10 talents[e] of silver, 6,000 shekels of gold,[f] and 10 suits of clothes. ", "6": "He brought the letter to the king of Israel. It read: \u201cThis is a letter of introduction for my servant Naaman,[g] whom I have sent to be cured of his skin disease.\u201d ", "7": "When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, \u201cAm I God? Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease?[h] Certainly you must see that he is looking for an excuse to fight me!\u201d[i]", "8": "When Elisha the prophet[j] heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent this message to the king, \u201cWhy did you tear your clothes? Send him[k] to me so he may know there is a prophet in Israel.\u201d ", "9": "So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood in the doorway of Elisha's house. ", "10": "Elisha sent out a messenger who told him, \u201cGo and wash seven times in the Jordan; your skin will be restored[l] and you will be healed.\u201d ", "11": "Naaman went away angry. He said, \u201cLook, I thought for sure he would come out, stand there, invoke the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the area, and cure the skin disease. ", "12": "The rivers of Damascus, the Abana and Pharpar, are better than any of the waters of Israel![m] Could I not wash in them and be healed?\u201d So he turned around and went away angry. ", "13": "His servants approached and said to him,[n] \u201cO master,[o] if the prophet had told you to do some difficult task,[p] you would have been willing to do it.[q] It seems you should be happy that he simply said, 'Wash and you will be healed.'[r] ", "14": "So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed.[s] His skin became as smooth as a young child's[t] and he was healed.", "15": "He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman[u] came and stood before him. He said, \u201cFor sure[v] I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel! Now, please accept a gift from your servant.\u201d ", "16": "But Elisha[w] replied, \u201cAs certainly as the Lord lives (whom I serve),[x] I will take nothing from you.\u201d Naaman[y] insisted that he take it, but he refused. ", "17": "Naaman said, \u201cIf not, then please give your servant a load of dirt, enough for a pair of mules to carry,[z] for your servant will never again offer a burnt offering or sacrifice to a god other than the Lord.[aa] ", "18": "May the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship, and he leans on my arm and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord forgive your servant for this.\u201d[ab] ", "19": "Elisha[ac] said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d When he had gone a short distance,[ad] ", "20": "Gehazi, the prophet Elisha's servant, thought,[ae] \u201cLook, my master did not accept what this Syrian Naaman offered him.[af] As certainly as the Lord lives, I will run after him and accept something from him.\u201d ", "21": "So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d[ag] ", "22": "He answered, \u201cEverything is fine.[ah] My master sent me with this message, 'Look, two servants of the prophets just arrived from the Ephraimite hill country.[ai] Please give them a talent[aj] of silver and two suits of clothes.'\u201d ", "23": "Naaman said, \u201cPlease accept two talents of silver.\u201d[ak] He insisted, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two suits of clothes. He gave them to two of his servants and they carried them for Gehazi.[al] ", "24": "When he arrived at the hill, he took them from the servants[am] and put them in the house. Then he sent the men on their way.[an]", "25": "When he came and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, \u201cWhere have you been, Gehazi?\u201d He answered, \u201cYour servant hasn't been anywhere.\u201d ", "26": "Elisha[ao] replied, \u201cI was there in spirit when a man turned and got down from his chariot to meet you.[ap] This is not the proper time to accept silver or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, cattle, and male and female servants.[aq] ", "27": "Therefore Naaman's skin disease will afflict[ar] you and your descendants forever!\u201d When Gehazi[as] went out from his presence, his skin was as white as snow.[at]"}

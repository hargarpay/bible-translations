{"1": "The Lord said to Jeremiah:[a] ", "2": "\u201cHear[b] the terms of the covenant[c] I made with Israel[d] and pass them on[e] to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem.[f] ", "3": "Tell them that the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'Anyone who does not keep the terms of the covenant will be under a curse.[g] ", "4": "Those are the terms that I charged your ancestors[h] to keep[i] when I brought them out of Egypt, that place that was like an iron-smelting furnace.[j] I said at that time,[k] \u201cObey me and carry out the terms of the covenant[l] exactly as I commanded you. If you do,[m] you will be my people and I will be your God.[n] ", "5": "Then I will keep the promise I swore on oath to your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d[o] That is the very land that you still live in today.'\u201d[p] And I responded, \u201cAmen. Let it be so,[q] Lord.\u201d", "6": "The Lord said to me, \u201cAnnounce all the following words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: 'Listen to the terms of my covenant with you[r] and carry them out!

", "8": "But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me! Each one of them followed the stubborn inclinations of his own wicked heart. So I brought on them all the punishments threatened in the covenant because they did not carry out its terms as I commanded them to do.'\u201d[u]", "9": "The Lord said to me, \u201cThe people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem have plotted rebellion against me.[v] ", "10": "They have gone back to the evil ways[w] of their ancestors of old who refused to obey what I told them. They, too, have paid allegiance to[x] other gods and worshiped them. Both the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah[y] have violated the covenant I made with their ancestors.

However, those gods will by no means be able[ab] to save them when disaster strikes them. ", "13": "This is in spite of the fact that[ac] the people of Judah have as many gods as they have towns[ad] and the citizens of Jerusalem have set up as many altars to sacrifice to that disgusting god, Baal, as they have streets in the city!'[ae] ", "14": "But as for you, Jeremiah,[af] do not pray for these people. Do not raise a cry of prayer for them.[ag] For I will not listen to them when they call out to me for help when disaster strikes them.\u201d[ah]", "15": "The Lord says to the people of Judah,[ai] \u201cWhat right do you have to be in my temple, my beloved people?[aj] Many of you have done wicked things.[ak] Can your acts of treachery be so easily canceled by sacred offerings[al] that you take joy in doing evil even while you make them?[am]", "16": "I, the Lord, once called[an] you a thriving olive tree, one that produced beautiful fruit. But I will set you[ao] on fire, fire that will blaze with a mighty roar.[ap] Then all your branches will be good for nothing.[aq]", "17": "For though I, the Lord of Heaven's Armies,[ar] planted you in the land,[as] I now decree that disaster will come on you[at] because the nations of Israel and Judah have done evil and have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal.\u201d[au]", "18": "The Lord gave me knowledge, that I might have understanding.[av] Then he showed me what the people were doing.[aw]", "19": "Before this I had been like a docile lamb ready to be led to the slaughter. I did not know they were making plans to kill me.[ax] I did not know they were saying,[ay] \u201cLet's destroy the tree along with its fruit![az] Let's remove Jeremiah[ba] from the world of the living so people will not even be reminded of him anymore.\u201d[bb]", "20": "So I said,[bc] \u201cO Lord of Heaven's Armies,[bd] you are a just judge!

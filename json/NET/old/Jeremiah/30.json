Why then do I see all these strong men grabbing their stomachs in pain like[l] a woman giving birth?

For I have attacked you like an enemy would. I have chastened you cruelly. For your wickedness is so great and your sin is so much.[ae]", "15": "Why do you complain about your injuries, that your pain is incurable? I have done all this to you because your wickedness is so great and your sin is so much.", "16": "But[af] all who destroyed you will be destroyed. All your enemies will go into exile.

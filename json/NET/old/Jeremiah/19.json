{"1": "The Lord told Jeremiah,[a] \u201cGo and buy a clay jar from a potter.[b] Take with you[c] some of the leaders of the people and some of the leaders[d] of the priests. ", "2": "Go out to the part of the Hinnom Valley that is near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate.[e] Announce there what I tell you.[f] ", "3": "Say, 'Listen to the Lord's message, you kings of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem! This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies,[g] the God of Israel, has said, \u201cLook here! I am about to bring a disaster on this place[h] that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it ring.[i] ", "4": "I will do so because these people[j] have rejected me and have defiled[k] this place. They have offered sacrifices in it to other gods that neither they nor their ancestors[l] nor the kings of Judah knew anything about. They have filled it with the blood of innocent children.[m] ", "5": "They have built places here[n] for worship of the god Baal so that they could sacrifice their children as burnt offerings to him in the fire. Such sacrifices[o] are something I never commanded them to make. They are something I never told them to do! Indeed, such a thing never even entered my mind.

They will die by the sword[s] at the hands of their enemies.[t] I will make their dead bodies food for the birds and wild beasts to eat.

All who pass by it will be filled with horror and will hiss out their scorn[u] because of all the disasters that have happened to it.[v] ", "9": "I will reduce the people of this city to desperate straits during the siege imposed on it by their enemies who are seeking to kill them. I will make them so desperate that they will eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters and the flesh of one another.\u201d'\u201d[w]", "10": "The Lord continued,[x] \u201cNow break the jar in front of those who have come here with you.

I will make it like Topheth. ", "13": "The houses in Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled by dead bodies[ad] just like this place, Topheth. For they offered sacrifice to the stars[ae] and poured out drink offerings to other gods on the roofs of those houses.'\u201d", "14": "Then Jeremiah left Topheth where the Lord had sent him to give that prophecy. He went to the Lord's temple and stood[af] in its courtyard and called out to all the people.

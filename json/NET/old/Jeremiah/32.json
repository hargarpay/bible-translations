{"1": "In the tenth year that Zedekiah was ruling over Judah the Lord spoke to Jeremiah.[a] That was the same as the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.", "2": "Now at that time,[b] the armies of the king of Babylon were besieging Jerusalem.[c] The prophet Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse[d] attached to the royal palace of Judah. ", "3": "For King Zedekiah[e] had confined Jeremiah there after he had reproved him for prophesying as he did. He had asked Jeremiah, \u201cWhy do you keep prophesying these things? Why do you keep saying that the Lord says, 'I will hand this city over to the king of Babylon? I will let him capture it.[f] ", "4": "King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Babylonians.[g] He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. He must answer personally to the king of Babylon and confront him face to face.[h] ", "5": "Zedekiah will be carried off to Babylon and will remain there until I have fully dealt with him.[i] I, the Lord, affirm it![j] Even if you[k] continue to fight against the Babylonians,[l] you cannot win.'\u201d", "6": "So now, Jeremiah said, \u201cThe Lord's message came to me,[m] ", "7": "'Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you soon. He will say to you, \u201cBuy my field at Anathoth because you are entitled[n] as my closest relative to buy it.\u201d'[o] ", "8": "And then my cousin Hanamel did come to me in the courtyard of the guardhouse in keeping with the Lord's message. He said to me, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. Buy it for yourself since you are entitled as my closest relative to take possession of it for yourself.' When this happened, I recognized that the Lord had indeed spoken to me. ", "9": "So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out seven ounces of silver and gave it to him to pay for it.[p] ", "10": "I signed the deed of purchase,[q] sealed it, and had some men serve as witnesses to the purchase.[r] I weighed out the silver for him on a scale.

I gave them to him in the presence[u] of my cousin[v] Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase, and all the Judeans who were housed in the courtyard of the guardhouse.

By this means you gained both in Israel and among humankind a renown that lasts to this day.[aj] ", "21": "You used your mighty power and your great strength to perform miracles and amazing deeds and to bring great terror on the Egyptians. By this means you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt.[ak] ", "22": "You kept the promise that you swore on oath to their ancestors.[al] You gave them a land flowing with milk and honey.[am] ", "23": "But when they came in and took possession of it, they did not obey you or live as you had instructed them. They did not do anything that you commanded them to do.[an] So you brought all this disaster on them. ", "24": "Even now siege ramps have been built up around the city[ao] in order to capture it. War,[ap] starvation, and disease are sure to make the city fall into the hands of the Babylonians[aq] who are attacking it.[ar] Lord,[as] you threatened that this would happen. Now you can see that it is already taking place.[at] ", "25": "The city is sure to fall into the hands of the Babylonians.[au] Yet, in spite of this,[av] you, Sovereign Lord,[aw] have said to me, \u201cBuy that field with silver and have the transaction legally witnessed.\u201d'\u201d[ax]", "26": "The Lord's message came to Jeremiah: ", "27": "\u201cI am the Lord, the God of all humankind.

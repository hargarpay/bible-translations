{"1": "The Lord spoke to Jeremiah concerning[a] all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, those in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the region of southern Egypt:[b] ", "2": "\u201cThe Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel,[c] says, 'You have seen all the disaster I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. Indeed, they now lie in ruins and are deserted.[d] ", "3": "This happened because of the wickedness the people living there did.[e] They made me angry[f] by worshiping and offering sacrifices to[g] other gods whom neither they nor you nor your ancestors[h] previously knew.[i] ", "4": "I sent my servants the prophets to you people over and over again[j] warning you not to do this disgusting thing I hate.[k] ", "5": "But the people of Jerusalem and Judah[l] would not listen or pay any attention. They would not stop the wickedness they were doing nor quit sacrificing to other gods.[m] ", "6": "So my anger and my wrath were poured out and burned like a fire through the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. That is why they have become the desolate ruins that they are today.'", "7": "\u201cSo now the Lord God of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel,[n] asks, 'Why will you do such great harm to yourselves? Why should every man, woman, child, and baby of yours be destroyed from the midst of Judah? Why should you leave yourselves without a remnant? ", "8": "That is what will result from your making me angry by what you are doing.[o] You are making me angry by sacrificing to other gods here in the land of Egypt where you live. You will be destroyed for doing that! You will become an example used in curses[p] and an object of ridicule among all the nations of the earth.[q] ", "9": "Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their[r] wives, and by you and your wives?

Here in the land of Egypt they will fall in battle[x] or perish from starvation. People of every class[y] will die in war or from starvation. They will become an object of horror and ridicule, an example of those who have been cursed and that people use in pronouncing a curse.[z] ", "13": "I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt with war, starvation, and disease, just as I punished Jerusalem.

That is why your land has become the desolate, uninhabited ruin that it is today. That is why it has become a proverbial example used in curses.[am] ", "23": "You have sacrificed to other gods. You have sinned against the Lord! You have not obeyed the Lord! You have not followed his laws, his statutes, and his decrees. That is why this disaster that is evident to this day has happened to you.\u201d[an]", "24": "Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people, particularly to all the women,[ao] \u201cListen to the Lord's message, all you people of Judah who are in Egypt.

I will do it so that you will know that my threats to bring disaster on you will prove true.[ay] ", "30": "I, the Lord, promise that[az] I will hand Pharaoh Hophra[ba] king of Egypt over to his enemies who are seeking to kill him.

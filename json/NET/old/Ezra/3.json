", "6": "From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord. However, the Lord's temple was not at that time established.[o]", "7": "So they provided money[p] for the masons and carpenters, and food, beverages, and olive oil for the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar timber from Lebanon to the seaport[q] at Joppa, in accord with the edict of King Cyrus of Persia.

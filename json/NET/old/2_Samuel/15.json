Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, \u201cWhat city are you from?\u201d The person would answer, \u201cI, your servant,[c] am from one of the tribes of Israel.\u201d ", "3": "Absalom would then say to him, \u201cLook, your claims are legitimate and appropriate.[d] But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you.\u201d ", "4": "Absalom would then say, \u201cIf only they would make me[e] a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint[f] could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement.\u201d", "5": "When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom[g] would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him. ", "6": "Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty[h] of the citizens[i] of Israel.", "7": "After four[j] years Absalom said to the king, \u201cLet me go and repay my vow that I made to the Lord while I was in Hebron. ", "8": "For I made this vow[k] when I was living in Geshur in Aram: 'If the Lord really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, I will serve the Lord.'\u201d ", "9": "The king replied to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d So Absalom[l] got up and went to Hebron.", "10": "Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, \u201cWhen you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume[m] that Absalom rules in Hebron.\u201d ", "11": "Now 200 men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.[n] ", "12": "While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's adviser,[o] to come from his city, Giloh.[p] The conspiracy was gaining momentum, and the people were starting to side with Absalom.", "13": "Then a messenger came to David and reported, \u201cThe men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!\u201d[q] ", "14": "So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, \u201cCome on![r] Let's escape![s] Otherwise no one will be delivered from Absalom! Go immediately, or else he will quickly overtake us and bring[t] disaster on us and kill the city's residents with the sword.\u201d[u] ", "15": "The king's servants replied to the king, \u201cWe will do whatever our lord the king decides.\u201d[v]", "16": "So the king and all the members of his royal court[w] set out on foot, though the king left behind ten concubines[x] to attend to the palace.

They were leaving with[ab] the king.", "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, \u201cWhy should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new[ac] king, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own country.[ad] ", "20": "It seems as if you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men[ae] with you. May genuine loyal love[af] protect[ag] you!\u201d", "21": "But Ittai replied to the king, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether it means death or life, there I[ah] will be as well!\u201d ", "22": "So David said to Ittai, \u201cCome along then.\u201d[ai] So Ittai the Gittite went along,[aj] accompanied by all his men and all the dependents[ak] who were with him.", "23": "All the land was weeping loudly[al] as all these people were leaving.[am] As the king was crossing over the Kidron Valley, all the people were leaving[an] on the road that leads to the desert.

When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving[ao] the city.", "25": "Then the king said to Zadok, \u201cTake the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the Lord's sight he will bring me back and enable me to see both it and his dwelling place again.

Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.[ar] ", "28": "Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you[as] reaches me.\u201d ", "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.", "30": "As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet were bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up.

", "33": "David said to him, \u201cIf you leave[av] with me you will be a burden to me. ", "34": "But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father's servant, and now I will be your servant.' ", "35": "Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you.[aw] Everything you hear in the king's palace[ax] you must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

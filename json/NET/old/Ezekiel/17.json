Now this vine twisted its roots toward him and sent its branches toward him to be watered from the soil where it was planted.", "8": "In a good field, by abundant waters, it was planted to grow branches, bear fruit, and become a beautiful vine.'", "9": "\u201cSay to them: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: \u201c'Will it prosper? Will he not rip out its roots and cause its fruit to rot[m] and wither? All its foliage[n] will wither. No strong arm or large army will be needed to pull it out by its roots.[o]", "10": "Consider! It is planted, but will it prosper? Will it not wither completely when the east wind blows on it?

Howl, oaks of Bashan, because the impenetrable forest has fallen.", "3": "Listen to the howling of shepherds, because their magnificence has been destroyed. Listen to the roaring of young lions, because the thickets of the Jordan have been devastated.", "4": "The Lord my God says this: \u201cShepherd the flock set aside for slaughter. ", "5": "Those who buy them[b] slaughter them and are not held guilty; those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich.' Their own shepherds have no compassion for them.

They will devastate the land, and I will not deliver it from them.\u201d", "7": "So I[c] began to shepherd the flock destined for slaughter, the most afflicted[d] of all the flock. Then I took two staffs,[e] calling one \u201cPleasantness\u201d[f] and the other \u201cUnion,\u201d[g] and I tended the flock.

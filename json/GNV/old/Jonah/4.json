Therefore it displeased [a]Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.", "2": "And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? therefore I prevented it to flee unto [b]Tarshish: for I knew, that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.", "3": "Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life [c]from me: for it is better for me to die than to live.", "4": "Then said the Lord, Doest thou well to be [d]angry?", "5": "So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the East side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow [e]till he might see what should be done in the city.", "6": "And the Lord God prepared a [f]gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, and deliver him from his grief.

And he said, I do well to be [g]angry unto the death.", "10": "Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night,", "11": "And should [h]not I spare Nineveh that great city, wherein are sixscore thousand persons, that [i]cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?"}

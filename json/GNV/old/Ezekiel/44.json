shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, O house of Israel, ye have enough of all your abominations,", "7": "Seeing that ye have brought into my Sanctuary [c]strangers uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my Sanctuary, to pollute mine house, when ye offer my bread, even fat, and blood: and they have broken my covenant, because of all your abominations.", "8": "For ye have not kept the [d]ordinances of mine holy things: but you yourselves have set others to take the charge of my Sanctuary.", "9": "Thus saith the Lord God, No stranger uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my Sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel,", "10": "Neither yet the [e]Levites that are gone back from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray from me after their idols, but they shall bear their iniquity.", "11": "And they shall serve in my Sanctuary, and keep the gates of the House, and minister in the House: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people: and they shall stand before them to serve them.", "12": "Because they served before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity,", "13": "And they shall not come near unto me to do the office of the Priest unto me, neither shall they come near unto any of mine holy things in the most holy place, but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations, which they have committed.", "14": "And I will make them keepers of the watch of the House, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.", "15": "But the Priests of the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that [f]kept the charge of my Sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to serve me, and they shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the

garments.", "20": "They shall not also [g]shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long, but round their heads.", "21": "Neither shall any Priests drink wine when they enter into the inner

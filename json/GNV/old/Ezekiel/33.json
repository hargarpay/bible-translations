{"1": "The office of the governors and ministers.\u200314 He strengtheneth them that despair, and boldeneth them with the promise of mercy.\u200330 The word of the Lord against the mockers of the Prophet. Again, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,", "2": "Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man [a]from among them, and make him their [b]watchman,", "3": "If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people,", "4": "Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, and will not be warned, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.", "5": "For he heard the sound of the trumpet, and would not be admonished: therefore his blood shall be upon him: but he that receiveth warning, shall save his life.", "6": "But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned: if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away for his [c]iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.", "7": "So thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore thou shalt hear the word at my [d]mouth, and admonish them from me.", "8": "When I shall say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt die the death, if thou dost not speak and admonish the wicked of his way, that wicked man shall die for his iniquity, but his blood will I [e]require at thine hand.", "9": "Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, if he do not turn from his way, he shall die for his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.", "10": "Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, Thus ye speak and say, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we are consumed because of them, [f]how should we then live?", "11": "Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, [g]I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn you, turn you from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O ye house of Israel?", "12": "Therefore thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The [h]righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression, nor the wickedness of the wicked shall cause him to fall therein, in the day that he returneth from his wickedness, neither shall the righteous live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.", "13": "When I shall say unto the righteous, that he shall surely live, if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousness shall be no more remembered, but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for the same.", "14": "Again when I shall say unto the wicked, Thou shalt die the death, if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and [i]right,", "15": "To wit, if the wicked restore the pledge, and give again that he had robbed, and walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity, he shall surely live, and not die.", "16": "None of his sins that he hath committed, shall be mentioned unto him: because he hath done that, which is lawful and right, he shall surely live.", "17": "Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but their own way is unequal.", "18": "When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.", "19": "But if the wicked return from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.", "20": "Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal, O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.", "21": "Also in the twelfth year of our [j]captivity, in the tenth month, and in the fifth day of the month, one that had escaped out of Jerusalem, came unto me, and said, The city is smitten.", "22": "Now the [k]hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening afore he that had escaped, came, and had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning: and when he had opened my [l]mouth, I was no more dumb.", "23": "Again the word of the Lord came unto me, and said,", "24": "Son of man, these that dwell in the desolate places of the land of Israel, talk and say, [m]Abraham was but one, and he possessed the land: but we are many, therefore the land shall be given us in possession.", "25": "Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Ye eat with the [n]blood, and lifted up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: should ye then possess the land?", "26": "Ye lean upon your [o]swords, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: should ye then possess the land?", "27": "Say thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, As I live, so surely they that are in the desolate places, shall fall by the sword: and him that is in the open field, will I give unto the beasts to be devoured: and they that be in the forts and in the caves, shall die of the pestilence.", "28": "For I will lay the land desolate and waste, and the pomp of her strength shall cease: and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, and none shall pass through.", "29": "Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I have laid the land desolate and waste, because of all their abominations, that they have committed.", "30": "Also thou son of man, the children of thy people that [p]talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of houses, and speak one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh from the Lord.", "31": "For they come unto thee, as the people useth to come: and my people sit before thee, and hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouths they make [q]jests, and their heart goeth after their covetousness.", "32": "And lo, thou art unto them, as a [r]jesting song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can sing well: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.", "33": "And when this cometh to pass (for lo, it will come) then shall they know, that a Prophet hath been among them."}

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,", "2": "Son of man, what cometh of the vine tree above all other trees? and of the vine branch, which is among the [a]trees of the forest?", "3": "Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?", "4": "Behold, it is cast in the fire to be consumed: the fire consumeth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burnt. Is it meet for any work?", "5": "Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet for any work, when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burnt?", "6": "Therefore thus saith the Lord God, as the vine tree, that is among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.", "7": "And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from one [b]fire, and another fire shall consume them: and ye shall know, that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them,", "8": "And when I make the land waste, because they have greatly offended, saith the Lord God."}

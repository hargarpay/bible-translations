{"1": "The restoring of the city and the Temple. In the five and twentieth year of our being in captivity, in the [a]beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me thither.", "2": "Into the land of Israel brought he me by [b]a divine vision, and set me upon a very high mountain, whereupon was as the building of a city, toward the South.", "3": "And he brought me thither, and behold, there was a [c]man, whose similitude was to look to, like brass, with a linen thread in his hand, and a reed to measure with: and he stood at the gate.", "4": "And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee: for to the intent that they might be showed thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest unto the house of Israel.", "5": "And behold, I saw a wall on the outside of the house round about: and in the man's hand was a reed to measure with, of six cubits long, by the cubit, and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building with one reed, and the height with one reed.", "6": "Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the East, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the [d]post of the gate, which was one reed broad, and [e]the other post of the gate, which was one reed broad.", "7": "And every chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad, and between the chambers were five cubits: and the post of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.", "8": "He measured also the porch of the gate within with one reed.", "9": "Then measured he the porch of the gate of eight cubits and the [f]posts thereof, of two cubits, and the porch of the gate was inward.", "10": "And the Chambers of the gate Eastward, were three on this side, and three on that side: they three were of one measure, and the posts had one measure on this side, and one on that side.", "11": "And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate ten cubits, and the height of the gate thirteen cubits.", "12": "The space also before the chambers was one cubit on this side and the space was one cubit on that side, and the chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.", "13": "He measured then the gate from the roof of a chamber to the top of the gate: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.", "14": "He made also posts of threescore cubits, and the posts of the court, and of the gate, had one measure round about.", "15": "And upon the forefront of the entry of the gate unto the forefront of the porch of the gate within were fifty cubits.", "16": "And there were narrow windows in the chambers, and in their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and the windows went round about within: and upon the posts were palm trees.", "17": "\u00b6 Then brought he me into the outward court, and lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about, and thirty chambers were upon the pavement.", "18": "And the pavement was by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates, and the pavement was beneath.", "19": "Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate without, unto the forefront of the court within, an hundred cubits Eastward and Northward.", "20": "And the gate of the outward court, that looked toward the North, measured he after the length and breadth thereof.", "21": "And the chambers thereof were three on this side, and three on that side, and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.", "22": "And their windows, and their arches with their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the East, and the going up unto it had seven steps, and the arches thereof were before them.", "23": "And the gate of the inner court stood over against the gate toward the North, and toward the East, and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.", "24": "After that, he brought me toward the South, and lo, there was a gate toward the South, and he measured the posts thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures.", "25": "And there were windows in it, and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the height was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.", "26": "And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them, and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side upon the post thereof.", "27": "\u00b6 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the South, and he measured from gate to gate toward the South an hundred cubits.", "28": "And he brought me into the inner court by the South gate, and he measured the South gate, according to these measures,", "29": "And the chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures, and there were windows in it, and in the arches thereof round about, it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.", "30": "And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.", "31": "And the arches thereof were toward the utter Court, and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, and the going up to it had eight steps.", "32": "\u00b6 Again he brought me into the inner court toward the East, and he measured the gate according to these measures.", "33": "And the chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof were according to these measures, and there were windows therein, and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.", "34": "And the arches thereof were toward the utter court, and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side and on that side, and the going up to it had eight steps.", "35": "\u00b6 After he brought me to the North gate, and measured it, according to these measures,", "36": "The chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and there were windows therein round about: the height was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.", "37": "And the posts thereof were toward the utter court, and palm trees were upon the posts thereof on this side, and on that side, and the going up to it had eight steps.", "38": "And every chamber, and the entry thereof was under the posts of the gates: there they washed the burnt offering.", "39": "And in the porch of the gate stood two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, upon the which they slew the burnt offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering.", "40": "And at the side beyond the steps, at the entry of the North gate stood two tables, and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate were two tables.", "41": "Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side by the side of the gate even eight tables whereupon they slew their sacrifice.", "42": "And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.", "43": "And within were borders an hand broad, fastened round about, and upon the tables lay the flesh of the offering.", "44": "And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the North gate: and their prospect was toward the South, and one was at the side of the East gate, having the prospect toward the North.", "45": "And he said unto me, This chamber whose prospect is toward the South is for the Priests, that have charge to keep the house.", "46": "And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North, is for the Priests that have the charge to keep the Altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which may come near to the Lord to minister unto him.", "47": "So he measured the court an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, even four square: likewise the Altar that was before the house.", "48": "And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured the posts of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.", "49": "The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it, and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side."}

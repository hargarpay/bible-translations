And on a day the [a]children of God came and stood before the Lord, and [b]Satan came also among them, and stood before the Lord.", "2": "Then the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, From compassing the earth to and fro, and from walking in it.", "3": "And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou not considered my servant Job, how none is like him in the earth? an upright and just man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? for yet he continueth in his uprightness, [c]although thou movedst me against him, to destroy [d]him without cause.", "4": "And Satan answered the Lord, and said, [e]Skin for skin, and all that ever a man hath, will he give for his life.", "5": "But stretch now out thine hand, and touch his [f]bones and his flesh, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.", "6": "Then the Lord said unto Satan, Lo, he is in thine hand, but save [g]his life.", "7": "\u00b6 So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore [h]boils, from the sole of his foot unto his crown.", "8": "And he took a [i]potsherd to scrape him, and he sat down among the ashes.", "9": "Then said his [j]wife unto him, Dost thou [k]continue yet in thine uprightness?

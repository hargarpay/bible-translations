by [c]books the number of the years, whereof the Lord had spoken unto Jeremiah the Prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolation of Jerusalem.", "3": "And I turned my face unto the Lord God, and [d]sought by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.", "4": "And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, saying, Oh Lord God which art [e]great and fearful, and keepest covenant and mercy toward them which love [f]thee, and toward them that keep thy commandments,", "5": "We have sinned and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, yea, we

consummation determined shall be poured upon the desolate."}

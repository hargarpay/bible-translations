Priest's office.", "2": "And bring also with thee thy brethren of the tribe of Levi of the family of thy father which shall be joined with thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the Tabernacle of the Testimony:", "3": "And they shall [b]keep my charge, even the charge of all the Tabernacle: but they shall not come near the instruments of the Sanctuary, nor to the altar, lest they die, both they and you.", "4": "And they shall be joined with thee, and keep the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation for all the service of the Tabernacle: and no [c]stranger shall come near unto you:", "5": "Therefore shall ye keep the charge of the Sanctuary, and the charge of the Altar: so there shall fall no more wrath upon the children of Israel.", "6":

openeth the matrix of any flesh, which they shall offer unto the Lord of man or beast, shall be thine: but the firstborn of man shalt thou redeem, and the firstborn of the unclean beast shalt thou redeem.", "16": "And those that are to be redeemed, shalt thou redeem from the age of a month, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.", "17": "But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat shalt thou not [j]redeem: for they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood at the altar,

inheritance, for their service which they serve in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.", "22": "Neither shall the children of Israel any more [m]come near the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest they sustain sin, and die.", "23": "But the Levites shall do the service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and they shall bear [n]their sin: it is a law forever in your generations, that among the children of Israel they possess none inheritance.", "24": "For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they shall offer as an offering unto the Lord, I have given the Levites for an inheritance, therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel ye shall possess none inheritance.", "25": "\u00b6 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,", "26": "Speak also unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye shall take of the children of Israel the tithes, which I have given you of them for your inheritance, then shall ye take an heave offering of that same for the Lord, even the tenth

counted unto the Levites, as the increase of the corn floor, or as the increase of the winepress.", "31": "And ye shall eat it in all [r]places, ye, and your households: for it is your wages for your service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.", "32": "And ye shall [s]bear no sin by the reason of it, when ye have offered the fat of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy [t]things of the children of Israel, lest ye die."}

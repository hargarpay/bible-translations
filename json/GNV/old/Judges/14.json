Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines,", "2": "And he came up and told his father and his mother and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore [a]give me her to wife.", "3": "Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there [b]never a wife among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, that thou must go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Give me her, for she pleaseth me well.", "4": "But his father and his mother knew not that it came of the Lord, that he should seek an occasion against the [c]Philistines: for at that time the Philistines reigned over Israel.", "5": "\u00b6 Then went Samson, and his father and his mother down to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared upon him.", "6": "And the Spirit of the Lord [d]came upon him, and he tare him, as one should have rent a kid, and had nothing in his hand, neither told he his father nor his mother what he had done.", "7": "And he went down, and talked with the woman which was beautiful in the eyes of Samson.", "8": "\u00b6 And within a few days, when he returned [e]to receive her, he went aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees, and honey in the body of the lion.", "9": "And he took thereof in his hands, and went eating, and came to his father and to his mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told not them, that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.", "10": "So his father went down unto the woman, and Samson made there a [f]feast: for so used the young men to do.", "11": "And when [g]they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.", "12": "Then Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: and if you can declare it me within seven days of the feast, and find it out, I will give you thirty sheets, and thirty [h]change of garments.", "13": "But if you cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.

In those days there was no [a]king in Israel, and at the same time the tribe of Dan sought them an inheritance to dwell in: for unto that time all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.", "2": "Therefore the children of Dan sent of their family, five men out of their coasts, even men expert in war, out of Zorah and Eshtaol, to view the land and search it out, and said unto them, [b]Go, and search out the land. Then they came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah and lodged there.", "3": "When they were in the house of Micah, they knew the [c]voice of the young man the Levite: and being turned in thither, they said unto him, Who brought thee hither? or what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou to do here?", "4": "And he answered them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his Priest.", "5": "Again they said unto him, Ask counsel now of God, that we may know whether the way which we go, shall be prosperous.", "6": "And the Priest said unto them, [d]Go in peace: for the Lord guideth your way which ye go.", "7": "Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, which dwelt careless, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and sure, because no man [e]made any trouble in the land, or usurped any dominion: also they were far from the Sidonians, and had no business with other men.", "8": "\u00b6 So they came again unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What have ye done?", "9": "And they answered, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and surely it is very good, and [f]do ye sit still? be not slothful to go and enter to possess the land:", "10": "(If ye will go, ye shall come unto a careless people, and the country is large) for God hath given it into your hand.

the Lord from the city of David, which is Zion.", "2": "And all the men of Israel assembled unto King Solomon at the feast in the month of [c]Ethanim, which is the seventh month.", "3": "And all the Elders of Israel came, and the Priests took the Ark.", "4": "They bare the Ark of the Lord, and they bare the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle: those did the Priests and Levites bring up.", "5": "And King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him, were with him before the Ark, offering sheep and beeves, which could not be told, nor numbered for multitude.", "6": "So the [d]Priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place, into the oracle of the house into the most holy place, even under

now, O God of Israel, I pray thee, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.", "27": "[k]Is it true indeed that God will dwell on the earth? behold, the heavens, and the heavens of heavens are not able to contain thee: how much more unable is this house that I have built?", "28": "But have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to hear the cry and prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day:", "29": "That thine eyes may be open toward this house, night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My Name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth in this place.", "30": "Hear thou therefore the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel

the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land, which thou gavest unto their fathers.", "35": "\u00b6 When heaven shall be [q]shut up, and there shall be no rain because they have

prayer and their supplication, and [v]judge their cause.", "46": "If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them unto the enemies, so that they carry them away prisoners unto the land of the enemies, either far or near,", "47": "Yet [w]if they turn again unto their heart in the land (to the which they be carried away captives) and

heart, and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, which led them away captives, and pray unto thee toward [y]the way of their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city

earth for an inheritance, as thou saidest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.", "54": "And when Solomon had made an end of praying all this [ab]prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees, and stretching of his hands to heaven,", "55": "And stood and blessed all the Congregation of Israel, with a loud voice, saying,", "56": "Blessed be the Lord that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.", "57": "The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers, that he forsake us not, neither leave us,", "58": "That he may

this day.", "62": "\u00b6 Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the Lord.", "63": "And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the Lord, to wit, two and twenty thousand beeves, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the King and all the children of Israel dedicated the [ae]house of the Lord.", "64": "The same day did the King hallow the middle of the court, that was before the house of the Lord: for there he made burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar that was before the Lord, was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.", "65": "And Solomon made at that time a feast and all Israel with him, a very great Congregation, even from the entering in of [af]Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, [ag]seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.", "66": "And the eighth day he sent the people away: and they [ah]thanked the King, and went unto their tents joyous, and with glad heart, because of all the goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people."}

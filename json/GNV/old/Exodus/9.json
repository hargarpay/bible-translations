Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.", "2": "But if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt yet hold them still,", "3": "Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy flock which is in the field: for upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the cattle, and upon the sheep shall be a [a]mighty great moraine.", "4": "And the Lord shall do [b]wonderfully between the beasts of Israel, and the beasts of Egypt: so that there shall nothing die at all, that pertaineth to the children of Israel.", "5": "And the Lord appointed a time, saying, Tomorrow the Lord shall finish this thing in this land.", "6": "So the Lord did this thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.", "7": "Then Pharaoh [c]sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead: and the heart of Pharaoh was obstinate, and he did not let the people go.", "8": "\u00b6 And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take your handful of [d]ashes of the furnace, and Moses shall sprinkle them toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh,", "9": "And they shall be turned to dust in all the land of Egypt: and it shall be as a scab breaking out into blisters upon man, and upon beast throughout all the land of Egypt.", "10": "Then they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh: and Moses sprinkled them toward the heaven, and there came [a] [e]scab breaking out into blisters upon man, and upon beast.", "11": "And the sorcerers could not stand before Moses, because of the scab: for the scab was upon the enchanters and upon all the Egyptians.", "12": "And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said unto Moses.", "13": "\u00b6 Also the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go that they may serve me.", "14": "For I will at this time send my plagues upon [f]thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.", "15": "For now I will stretch out mine hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with the pestilence: and thou shalt perish from the earth.", "16": "And indeed, for

the cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for upon all the men, and the beasts, which are found in the field, and not brought home, the hail shall fall upon them, and they shall die.", "20": "Such then as feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.", "21": "But such as [k]regarded not the [l]word of the Lord, left his servants, and his cattle in the field.", "22": "\u00b6 And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon all the herbs of the field in the land of Egypt.", "23": "Then Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven, and the Lord sent thunder and [m]hail, and [n]lightning upon the ground: and the Lord caused hail to rain upon the land of Egypt.", "24": "So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so grievous, as there was none throughout all the land of Egypt, since [o]it was a nation.", "25": "And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast: also the hail smote all the trees of the field and brake to pieces all the trees of the field.", "26": "Only in the land of Goshen (where the children of Israel were) was no hail.", "27": "Then Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I [p]have now sinned: the Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked.", "28": "Pray ye unto the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more [q]mighty thunders, and hail, and I will let you go, and ye shall tarry no longer.", "29": "Then Moses said unto him, As soon as I am out of the city, I will spread mine hands unto the Lord, and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord's.", "30": "As for thee and thy servants, I know [r]afore I pray, ye will fear before the face of the Lord God.", "31": "(And the flax, and the barley were smitten: for the barley was eared, and the flax was bolled.", "32": "But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were [s]hid in the ground.)", "33": "Then Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread his hands to the Lord, and the thunder and the hail ceased, neither rained it upon the earth.", "34": "And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder were ceased, he sinned again, and hardened his heart, both he, and his servants.", "35": "So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened: neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had said [t]by Moses."}

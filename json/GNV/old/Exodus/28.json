And cause thou thy brother Aaron to come unto thee, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may serve me in the Priest's office: I mean, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar Aaron's sons.", "2": "Also thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, [a]glorious and beautiful.", "3": "Therefore thou shalt speak unto all [b]cunning men, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to [c]consecrate him, that he may serve me in the Priest's office.", "4": "Now these shall be the garments, which they shall make, a breastplate, and an [d]Ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: so these holy garments shall they make for Aaron thy brother, and for his sons, that he may serve me in the Priest's office.",

skirts thereof, and bells of gold between them round about:", "34": "That is, a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate round about upon the skirts of the robe.", "35": "So shall it be upon Aaron, when he ministereth, and his sound shall be heard when he goeth into the holy place before the Lord, and when he cometh out, and he shall not die.", "36": "\u00b6 Also thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave thereon, as signets are graven, [t]HOLINESS TO THE LORD.", "37": "And thou shalt put it on a blue silk lace, and it shall be upon the mitre, even upon the forefront of the mitre shall it be.", "38": "So shall it be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may [u]bear the iniquity of the offerings, which the children of Israel shall offer in all their holy offerings: and it shall be always upon his forehead, to make them acceptable before the Lord.", "39": "Likewise thou shalt embroider the fine linen coat, and thou shalt make a mitre of fine linen, but thou shalt make a girdle of needle work.", "40": "Also thou shalt make for Aaron's sons coats, and thou shalt make them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make them for glory and comeliness.", "41": "And

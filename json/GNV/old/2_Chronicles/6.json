and do according to all that the stranger calleth for unto thee, that all the people of the earth may know thy Name, and fear thee like thy people Israel, and that they may know that thy Name is called upon in this house which I have built.", "34": "\u00b6 When thy people shall go out to battle against their enemies, by the way that [s]thou shalt send them, and they pray to thee, [t]in the way toward this city, which thou hast chosen, even toward the house which I have built to thy Name,", "35": "Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and judge their cause.",

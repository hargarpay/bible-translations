In that [a]day the Lord with his sore and great and mighty [b]sword shall visit Leviathan, that piercing serpent, even Leviathan, that crooked serpent, and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.", "2": "In that day sing of the vineyard [c]of red wine.", "3": "I the Lord do keep it: I will water it every moment: lest any assail it, I will keep it night and day.", "4": "Anger [d]is not in me: who would set the briers and the thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.", "5": "Or will he [e]feel my strength, that he may make peace with me, and be at one with me?", "6": "[f]Hereafter Jacob shall take root: Israel shall flourish and grow: and the world shall be filled with fruit.", "7": "Hath he smitten [g]him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by him?", "8": "In [h]measure in the branches thereof wilt thou contend with it, when he bloweth with his rough wind in the day of the East wind.", "9": "By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the [i]fruit, the taking away of his sin: when he shall make all the stones of the altars, as chalk stones broken in pieces, that the groves and images may not stand up.", "10": "Yet the [j]defensed city shall be desolate, and the habitation shall be forsaken, and left like a wilderness. There shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie and consume the branches thereof.", "11": "When the boughs of it are dry, they shall be broken: the [k]women come and set them on fire: for it is a people of none understanding: therefore he that made them shall not have compassion of them, and he that formed them, shall have no mercy on them.", "12": "And in that day shall the Lord thresh from the channel of the [l]river unto the river of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered, one by one, O children of Israel.", "13": "In that day also shall the great trumpet be [m]blown, and they shall come, which perished in the land of Assyria, and they that were chased into the land of Egypt, and they shall worship the Lord in the holy Mount at Jerusalem."}

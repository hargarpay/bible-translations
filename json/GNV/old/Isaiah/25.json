{"1": "A thanksgiving to God in that that he showeth himself judge of the world, by punishing the wicked, and maintaining the godly. O Lord, thou [a]art my God: I will exalt thee, I will praise thy Name: for thou hast done wonderful things, according to the counsels of old, with a stable truth.", "2": "For thou hast made of a [b]city an heap, of a strong city, a ruin: even the place [c]of strangers of a city, it shall never be built.", "3": "Therefore shall the [d]mighty people give glory unto thee: the city of the strong nations shall fear thee.", "4": "For thou hast been a strength unto the poor, even a strength to the needy in his trouble, a refuge against the tempest, a shadow against the heat: for the blast [e]of the mighty is like a storm against the wall.", "5": "Thou shalt bring down the noise of the strangers, [f]as the heat in a dry place; he will bring down the song of the mighty, as [g]the heat in the shadow of a cloud.", "6": "And in this [h]mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, even a feast of fined wines, and of fat things full of marrow, of wines fined and purified.", "7": "And he will destroy in this mountain [i]the covering that covereth all people, and the veil that is spread upon all nations.", "8": "He will destroy death forever: and the Lord God will [j]wipe away the tears from all faces, and the rebuke of his people will he take away out of all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.", "9": "And in that day shall men say, Lo, this is our God: we have waited for him, and he will save us. This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will rejoice and be joyful in salvation.", "10": "For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and [k]Moab shall be threshed under him even as straw is threshed in [l]Madmenah.", "11": "And he shall stretch out his hand in the midst of them (as he that swimmeth stretcheth them out to swim) and with the strength of his hands shall he bring down their pride.", "12": "The defense also of the height of thy walls shall he bring down and lay low, and cast them to the ground, even unto the dust."}

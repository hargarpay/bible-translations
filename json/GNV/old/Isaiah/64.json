Oh, that thou wouldest [a]break the heavens, and come down, and that the mountains might melt at thy presence!", "2": "As the melting fire burned, as the fire caused [b]the waters to boil, (that thou mightest declare thy Name to thine adversaries) the people did tremble at thy presence.", "3": "When thou didst terrible things, which we looked not for, thou camest down, and the mountains melted at thy presence.", "4": "For since the beginning of the world, they have not [c]heard nor understood with the ear, neither hath the eye seen another God beside thee, which doeth so to him that waiteth for him.", "5": "Thou didst meet him, [d]that rejoiced in thee, and did justly: they remembered thee in thy [e]ways: behold, thou art angry, for we have sinned: yet in [f]them is continuance, and we [g]shall be saved.", "6": "But we have all been as an unclean thing, and all our [h]righteousness is as filthy cloths, and we all do fade like a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away.", "7": "And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, neither that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us because of our iniquities.", "8": "But now, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the [i]clay, and thou art our potter, and we all are the work of thine hands.", "9": "Be not angry, O Lord, [j]above measure, neither remember iniquity forever: Lo, we beseech thee, behold, we are all thy people.", "10": "[k]Thine holy cities lie waste: Zion is a wilderness, and Jerusalem a desert.", "11": "The house of our Sanctuary, and of our glory, [l]where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire, and all our pleasant things are wasted.", "12": "Wilt thou hold thyself still [m]at these things, O Lord? wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us above measure?"}

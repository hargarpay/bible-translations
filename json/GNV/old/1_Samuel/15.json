Afterward Samuel said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee King over his people, over Israel: now therefore [a]obey the voice of the words of the Lord.", "2": "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how they laid wait for them in the way, as they came up from Egypt.", "3": "Now therefore go, and smite Amalek, and destroy ye all that pertaineth unto them, and have no compassion on them, but [b]slay both man and woman, both infant and suckling, both ox, and sheep, both camel, and ass.", "4": "\u00b6 And Saul assembled the people, and [c]numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.", "5": "And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and [d]set watch at the river.", "6": "And Saul said unto the [e]Kenites, Go, depart, and get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed [f]mercy to all the children of Israel, when they came up from Egypt: and the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.", "7": "So Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah, as thou comest to Shur, that is before Egypt,", "8": "And took Agag the King of the Amalekites alive, and destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.", "9": "But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the better sheep, and the oxen, and the fat beasts, and the lambs, and all that was good, and they would not destroy them; but everything that was vile and nought worth, that they destroyed.", "10": "\u00b6 Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,", "11": "It [g]repenteth me that I have made Saul King; for he is turned from me, and hath not performed my commandments.

Because thou hast cast away the word of the Lord, therefore he hath cast away thee from being king.", "24": "Then Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.", "25": "Now therefore I pray thee, take away my [l]sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord.", "26": "But Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast cast away the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath cast away thee, that thou shalt not be King over Israel.", "27": "And as Samuel turned himself to go away, he caught the lap of his coat, and it rent.", "28": "Then Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy [m]neighbor, that is better than thou.", "29": "For indeed the [n]strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man that he should repent.", "30": "Then he said, I have sinned: but honor me, I pray thee, before the Elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God.", "31": "\u00b6 So Samuel turned again, and followed Saul: and Saul worshipped the Lord.", "32": "Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites: and Agag came unto him [o]pleasantly, and Agag said, Truly the [p]bitterness of death is passed.", "33": "And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among other women.

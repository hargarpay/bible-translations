So the Philistines were gathered together with all their armies in Aphek: and the Israelites pitched [a]by the fountain, which is in Jezreel.", "2": "And the [b]princes of the Philistines went forth by [c]hundreds and thousands, but David and his men came behind with Achish.", "3": "Then said the Princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?

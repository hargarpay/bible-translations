And when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall, and that there were no more [a]breaches therein (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates)", "2": "Then sent Sanballat and Geshem unto me, saying, come thou that we may meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono: and they thought to do me evil.", "3": "Therefore I sent messengers unto them, saying, I have a great work to do, and I cannot come down: [b]why should the work cease, while I leave it and come down to you?", "4": "Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort. And I answered them after the same manner.", "5": "Then sent Sanballat his servant after this sort unto me the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,", "6": "Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and [c]Gashmu hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for the which cause thou buildest the wall, and thou wilt be their king according to these [d]words.", "7": "Thou hast also ordained [e]the Prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a King in Judah: and now according to these words it shall come to the King's ears: come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.", "8": "Then I sent unto him, saying, It is not done according to these words that thou sayest: for thou feignest them of thine own heart.", "9": "For all they afraid us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, and it shall not be done: now therefore [f]encourage thou me.", "10": "\u00b6 And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, and he was [g]shut up, and he said, Let us come together into the house of God in the midst of the Temple, and shut the doors of the Temple: for they will come to slay thee: yea, in the night will they come to kill thee.", "11": "Then I said, [h]Should such a man as I, flee?

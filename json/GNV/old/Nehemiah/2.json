Now in the month [a]Nisan in the twentieth year of king [b]Artaxerxes, the wine stood before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I was not before time sad in his presence.", "2": "And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing, but sorrow of heart. Then was I sore afraid,", "3": "And I said to the King, God save the king forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city and house of the sepulchers of my fathers lieth waste, and the gates thereof are devoured with fire?", "4": "And the king said unto me, For what thing doest thou require? Then I prayed [c]to the God of heaven,", "5": "And said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, I desire that thou wouldest send me to Judah unto the city of the sepulchers of my fathers, that I may build it.", "6": "And the King said unto me, (the Queen also sitting by him:) How long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou come again? So it pleased the king, and he sent me, and I set him a time.", "7": "After I said unto the King, If it please the King, let them give me letters to the captains beyond the [d]River, that they may convey me over, till I come into Judah,", "8": "And letters unto Asaph the keeper of the king's [e]park, that he may give me timber to build the gates of the palace (which appertained to the house) and for the walls of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.

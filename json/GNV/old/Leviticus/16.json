Furthermore the Lord spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they came to offer before the Lord, and died:", "2": "And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at [a]all times into the holy place within the veil, before the Mercy seat, which is upon the Ark, that he die not, for I will appear in the cloud upon the Mercy seat.", "3": "After this sort shall Aaron come into the Holy place: even with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.", "4": "He shall put on the holy linen coat, and shall have linen breeches upon his [b]flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and shall cover his head with a linen miter, these are the holy garments: therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, when he doth put them on.", "5": "And he shall take of the Congregation of the children of Israel, two he goats for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.", "6": "Then Aaron shall offer the bullock for his sin

Israel, and all their trespasses in all their sins, putting them [j]upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away (by the hand of a man appointed) into the wilderness.", "22": "So the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities into [k]the land that is not inhabited, and he shall let the goat go into the wilderness.", "23": "After, Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and put off the linen clothes, which he put on when he went into the Holy place, and leave them there.", "24": "He shall wash also his flesh with water in [l]the holy place, and put on his own raiment, and come out, and make his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.", "25": "Also the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.", "26": "And he that carried forth the goat called the Scapegoat, shall wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and after that shall come into the host.", "27": "Also the bullock for the burnt offering, and the goat for the sin offering (whose blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the Holy place) shall one carry out without the host to be burnt in the fire, with their skins, and with their flesh, and with their dung.", "28": "And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and afterward come into the host.", "29": "\u00b6 So

unto you, and you shall humble your souls by an ordinance forever.", "32": "And the Priest [p]whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate (to minister in his father's stead) shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes and holy vestments,", "33": "And shall purge the holy Sanctuary and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall cleanse the altar, and make an atonement for the Priests and for all the people of the Congregation.", "34": "And this shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year:

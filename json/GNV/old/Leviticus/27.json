Priest shall value him, according to the ability of him that vowed, so shall the Priest value him.", "9": "And if it be a [f]beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord, all that one giveth of such unto the Lord, shall be holy.", "10": "He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, nor a bad for a good: and if he change beast for beast, then both this and that, which was changed

price, that thou esteemedst it at, thereunto, and it shall remain his.", "20": "And if he will not redeem the field, but the Priest [k]sell the field to another man, it shall be redeemed no more.",

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,", "2": "This is the [a]law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: that is, he shall be brought unto the Priest,", "3": "And the Priest shall go out of the camp, and the Priest shall consider him: and if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,", "4": "Then shall the Priest command to take for him that is cleansed, two [b]sparrows alive and

of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.", "30": "Also he shall present one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, [o]as he is able.", "31": "Such, I say, as he is able, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, [p]with the meat offering: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord.", "32": "This is the [q]Law of him which hath the plague of leprosy, who is not able in his cleansing to offer the whole.", "33": "\u00b6 The Lord also spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,", "34": "When ye be come unto the land of Canaan which I give you in possession, if I [r]send the plague of leprosy in an house of the land of your possession,", "35": "Then he that [owneth] the house shall come and tell the Priest, saying, Me think there is like a plague of leprosy in the house.", "36": "Then the Priest shall command them to empty the house before the Priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean, and then shall the Priest go in to see the house.", "37": "And he shall mark the plague: and if the plague be in the walls of the house, and that there be [s]deep spots, greenish or reddish, which seem to be lower than the wall.", "38": "Then the Priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shall cause to shut up the house seven days.", "39": "So the Priest shall come again the seventh day: and if he see that the plague be increased in the walls of the house,", "40": "Then the Priest shall command them to take away the stones wherein the plague is, and they shall cast them into a [t]foul place without the city.", "41": "Also he shall cause to scrape the house within round about, and pour the dust, that they have pared off, without the city in [u]an unclean place.", "42": "And they shall take other stones, and put them in the places of those stones, and shall take other mortar, to plaster the house with.", "43": "But if the plague come again and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after that he hath scraped and plastered the house,", "44": "Then the Priest shall come and see: and if the plague grow in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is therefore unclean.", "45": "And he shall [v]break down the house, with the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the [w]mortar of the house, and he shall carry them out of the city unto an unclean place.", "46": "Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up, he shall be unclean until the even.", "47": "He also that sleepeth in the house shall wash his clothes: he likewise that eateth in the house, shall wash his clothes.", "48": "But if the Priest shall come and see, that the plague hath spread no further in the house, after the house be plastered, the Priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the plague is healed.", "49": "Then shall he take to purify the house, two sparrows, and cedarwood, and [x]scarlet lace, and hyssop.", "50": "And he shall kill one sparrow over pure water in an earthen vessel,", "51": "And shall take the cedarwood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet lace with the live Sparrow, and dip them in the blood of the slain Sparrow, and in the pure water, and sprinkle the house seven times:", "52": "So shall he cleanse the house with the blood of the sparrow, and with the pure water, and with the live sparrow, and with the cedarwood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet lace.", "53": "Afterward he shall let go the live sparrow out of the [y]town into the [z]broad fields: so shall he make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.", "54": "This is the law for every plague of leprosy and black spot,", "55": "And of the leprosy of the garment, and of the house,", "56": "And of the [aa]swelling, and of the scab, and of the white spot.", "57": "This is the law of the leprosy, to teach [ab]when a thing is unclean, and when it is clean."}

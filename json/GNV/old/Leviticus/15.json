{"1": ", 19 The manner of purging the unclean issues both of men and women.\u200331 The children of Israel must be separate from all uncleanness. Moreover the Lord spake unto Moses, and to Aaron, saying,", "2": "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever hath an issue from his [a]flesh, is unclean, because of his issue.", "3": "And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue, when his flesh avoideth his issue, or if his flesh be stopped from his issue, this is [b]his uncleanness.", "4": "Every bed whereon he lieth that hath the issue, shall be unclean, and everything whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.", "5": "Whosoever also toucheth his bed, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even.", "6": "And he that sitteth on any thing, whereon he sat that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even.", "7": "Also he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even.", "8": "If he also that hath the issue, spit upon him that is clean, [c]he shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even.", "9": "And what [d]saddle soever he rideth upon, that hath the issue, shall be unclean,", "10": "And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him, shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even.", "11": "Likewise whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue (and hath not washed his hands in water) shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even.", "12": "And the vessel of earth that he toucheth, which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.", "13": "But if he that hath an issue, be [e]cleansed of his issue, then shall he count him seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in pure water: so shall he be clean.", "14": "Then the eighth day he shall take unto him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall give them unto the Priest,", "15": "And the Priest shall make of the one of them a sin offering, and of the other a burnt offering: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord for his issue.", "16": "Also if any man's issue of seed depart from him, he shall wash all his [f]flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.", "17": "And every garment, and every skin whereupon shall be issue of seed, shall be even washed with water, and be unclean unto the even.", "18": "If he that hath an issue of seed do lie with a woman, they shall both wash themselves with water, and be unclean until the even.", "19": "\u00b6 Also when a woman shall have an issue, and her issue in her [g]flesh shall be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her, shall be unclean until the even.", "20": "And whatsoever she lieth upon in [h]her separation, shall be unclean, and everything that she sitteth upon, shall be unclean.", "21": "Whosoever also toucheth her bed, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself with water, and shall be unclean unto the even.", "22": "And whosoever toucheth anything that she sat upon, shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean until the even:", "23": "So that whether he toucheth her bed, or anything whereon she hath sat, he shall be unclean unto the even.", "24": "And if a man lie with her, and the flowers of her separation [i]touch him, he shall be unclean seven days, and all the whole bed whereon he lieth, shall be unclean.", "25": "Also when a woman's issue of blood runneth long time besides the time of her [j]flowers, or when she hath an issue longer than her flowers, all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be unclean, as in the time of her flowers.", "26": "Every bed whereon she lieth (as long as her issue lasteth) shall be to her as the [k]bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon, shall be unclean, as her uncleanness when she is put apart.", "27": "And whosoever toucheth these things, shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shall be unclean unto the even.", "28": "But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall [l]count her seven days, and after, she shall be clean.", "29": "And in the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the Priest at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.", "30": "And the Priest shall make of the one a sin offering, and of the other a burnt offering, and the Priest shall make an atonement for her before the Lord, for the issue of her uncleanness.", "31": "Thus shall ye [m]separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, if they defile my Tabernacle that is among them.", "32": "This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him from whom goeth an issue of seed whereby he is defiled:", "33": "Also of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath a running issue, whether it be man or woman, and of him that lieth with her which is unclean."}

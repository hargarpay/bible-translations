Then [a]we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness, by the way of the red Sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and were compassed mount Seir [a] [b]long time.", "2": "And the Lord spake unto me, saying,", "3": "Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you Northward.", "4": "And warn thou the people, saying, Ye shall go through the [c]coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed therefore.", "5": "Ye shall not provoke them: for I will not give you of their land so much as a foot breadth, because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.", "6": "Ye shall buy meat of them for money to eat, and ye shall also procure water of them for money to drink.", "7": "For the Lord thy God hath [d]blessed thee in all the works of thine hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness, and the Lord thy God hath been with thee this forty years, and thou hast lacked nothing.", "8": "And when we were departed from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir: through the way of the [e]plain, from Elath, and from Ezion Geber, we turned and went by the way of the wilderness of Moab.", "9": "Then the Lord said unto me, Thou shalt not [f]vex Moab, neither provoke them to battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar unto the children [g]of Lot for a possession.", "10": "The [h]Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great and many, and tall, as the Anakims.", "11": "They also were taken for giants as the Anakims: whom the Moabites call Emims.", "12": "The Horites also dwelt in Seir before time, whom the children of Esau chased out and destroyed them before them, and dwelt in their stead: as Israel shall do unto the land of his possession, which the Lord hath given them.", "13": "Now rise up, said I, and get you over the river Zered: and we went over the river Zered.", "14": "The [i]space also wherein we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we were come over the river Zered, was eight and thirty years, until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the Lord sware unto them.", "15": "For indeed the [j]hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among the host, till they were consumed.", "16": "\u00b6 So when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people:", "17": "Then the Lord spake unto me, saying,", "18": "Thou shalt go through Ar the coast of Moab this day:", "19": "And thou shalt come near over against the children of Ammon: but shalt not lay siege unto them, nor move war against them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession: for I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.", "20": "That also was taken for a land [k]of giants: for giants dwelt therein afore time, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummims:", "21": "A people that was great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims: but the Lord destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them in their inheritance, and dwelt in their stead:", "22": "As he did to the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites

shall tremble and quake before thee.", "26": "Then I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon King of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,", "27": "\u00b6 Let me pass through thy land: I will go by the highway: I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.", "28": "Thou shalt sell me meat for money, for to eat, and shalt give me water for money for to drink: only I will go through on my foot,", "29": "(As the [o]children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me) until I be come over Jordan, into the land which the Lord our God

hand, as appeareth this day.", "31": "And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess and inherit his land.", "32": "Then came out Sihon to meet us, himself with all his people to fight at Jahaz.", "33": "But the Lord our God delivered him [q]into our power, and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.", "34": "And we took all his

God forbade us."}

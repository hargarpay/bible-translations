I speak not to your children, which have neither known nor seen) the chastisements of the Lord your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,", "3": "And his signs, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt, unto Pharaoh the King of Egypt and unto all his land:", "4": "And what he did unto the host of the Egyptians, unto their horses, and to their chariots, when he caused the waters of the red Sea to overflow them, as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them unto this day:", "5": "And [b]what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place:", "6": "And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them with their households, and their tents, and all their

rain of heaven.", "12": "This land doth the Lord thy God care for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year.", "13": "\u00b6 If ye

shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as a frontlet between your eyes,", "19": "And ye shall teach them your

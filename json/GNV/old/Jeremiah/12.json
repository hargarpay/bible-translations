{"1": "The Prophet marvelleth at the prosperity of the wicked, although he confess God to be righteous.\u20037 The Jews are forsaken of the Lord.\u200310 He speaketh against pastors and preachers, that seduce the people.\u200314 The Lord threateneth destruction unto the nations that troubled Judah. O Lord, if I dispute with thee, thou art [a]righteous: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: wherefore doth the way of the wicked [b]prosper? why are all they in wealth that rebelliously transgress?", "2": "Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they grow, and bring forth fruit, thou art near in their mouth, and far from their [c]reins.", "3": "But thou, Lord, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and [d]prepare them for the day of slaughter.", "4": "How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds, because they said, [e]He will not see our last end.", "5": "If thou hast run with the [f]footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou match thyself with horses? and if thou thoughtest thyself safe in a peaceable land, what wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?", "6": "For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, even they have dealt unfaithfully with thee, and they have cried out altogether upon thee: but believe them not, though they speak fair to thee.", "7": "I have forsaken [g]mine house: I have left mine heritage: I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.", "8": "Mine heritage is unto me, as a [h]lion in the forest: it crieth out against me, therefore have I hated it.", "9": "Shall mine heritage be unto me, as a bird [i]of divers colors? are not the birds about her, saying, Come, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to eat her?", "10": "Many pastors have destroyed my [j]vineyard, and trodden my portion under foot: of my pleasant portion they have made a desolate wilderness.", "11": "They have laid it waste, and it, being waste mourneth unto me, and the whole land lieth waste, because no man setteth his mind on [k]it.", "12": "The destroyers are come upon all the high places in the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land, even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.", "13": "[l]They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they were [m]sick, and had no profit: and they were ashamed of [n]your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.", "14": "Thus saith the Lord against all mine evil [o]neighbors, that touch the inheritance, which I have caused my people Israel to inherit, Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.", "15": "And after that I have plucked them out, I [p]will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.", "16": "And if they will learn the [q]ways of my people, to swear by my Name, (The [r]Lord liveth, as they taught my people to swear by Baal) then shall they be built [s]in the midst of my people.", "17": "But if they will not obey, then will I utterly pluck up, and destroy that nation, saith the Lord."}

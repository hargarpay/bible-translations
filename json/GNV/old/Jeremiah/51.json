shall fan her, and shall empty her land, for in the day of trouble they shall be against her on every side.", "3": "Also to the bender that bendeth his bow, and to him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine, will I say, Spare not her young men, but destroy all her host.", "4": "Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.", "5": "For Israel hath been no [c]widow, nor Judah from his God, from the Lord of hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the holy one of Israel.", "6": "\u00b6 [d]Flee out of the midst of Babel, and deliver every man his soul: be not destroyed in her iniquity: for this is the time of the Lord's vengeance: he will render unto her a recompense.", "7": "Babel hath been as a golden cup in the [e]Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken, the nations have drunken of her wine, therefore do the nations [f]rage.", "8": "Babel is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her, bring balm for her sore, if she may be healed.", "9": "We would have cured Babel, but she could not be healed: forsake her, and let [g]us go everyone into his own country: for her judgment is come up into heaven, and is lifted up to the clouds.", "10": "The Lord hath brought forth our [h]righteousness: come and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.", "11": "Make bright the arrows: [i]gather the

Lord.", "27": "Set up a standard in the land: blow the trumpets among the nations: prepare the nations against her: call up the kingdoms of [t]Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz against her, appoint the

land of his dominion.", "29": "And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for the device of the Lord shall be performed against Babel, to make the land of Babel waste without an inhabitant.", "30": "The strong men of Babel have ceased to fight: they have remained in their holds: their strength hath failed, and they were like women: they have burnt her dwelling places, and her bars are broken.", "31": "A post shall run to meet the post, and a messenger to meet the messenger, to show the King of Babel, that his city is taken on a [u]side thereof,", "32": "And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds burnt with fire, and the men of war troubled.", "33": "For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, The daughter of Babel is like a threshingfloor: the time of her threshing is come: yet

her springs.", "37": "And Babel shall be as heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.", "38": "They shall roar together like lions, and yell as the lion's whelps.", "39": "In their [y]heat I will make them feasts, and I will make them drunken that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the Lord.", "40": "I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, and like rams and goats.", "41": "How is [z]Sheshach taken! and how is the glory of the whole earth taken! how is Babel become an astonishment among the nations!", "42": "The [aa]sea is come up upon Babel: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.", "43": "Her cities are desolate: the land is dry and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth the son of man pass thereby.", "44": "I will also visit Bel in Babel, and I will bring out of his mouth, that which [ab]he hath swallowed up, and the nations shall run no more unto him, and the wall of Babel shall fall.", "45": "My people, go out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce wrath of the Lord,", "46": "Lest your heart even faint,

me shall her destroyers come, saith the Lord.", "54": "A sound of a cry cometh from Babel, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,", "55": "Because the Lord hath laid Babel waste, and destroyed from her the great voice, and her waves shall roar like great waters, and a sound was made by their noise:", "56": "Because the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babel, and her strong men are taken, their bows are broken: for the Lord God that recompenseth, shall surely recompense.", "57": "And I will [ai]make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her dukes, and her nobles, and her strong men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose Name is the Lord of hosts.", "58": "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The [aj]thick wall of Babel shall be broken, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the people shall labor in vain, and the folk in the fire, for they shall be weary.", "59": "The word which Jeremiah the Prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babel, in the [ak]fourth year of his reign, and this Seraiah was a peaceable Prince.", "60": "So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babel, even all these things that are written against Babel.", "61": "And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest unto Babel, and shalt see and shalt read all these words,", "62": "Then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to destroy it, that none should remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it should be desolate forever.", "63": "And when thou hast made an end of reading this book, thou shalt bind a [al]stone to it, and cast it in the midst of Euphrates,", "64": "And shalt say, Thus shall Babel be drowned and shall not rise from the evil, that I will bring upon her: and they shall [am]be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah."}

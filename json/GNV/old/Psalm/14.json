The fool hath said in his heart, [a]There is no God: they have [b]corrupted, and done an abominable work: there is none that doeth good.", "2": "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that would understand, and seek God.", "3": "[c]All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt: there is none that doeth good, no not one.", "4": "Do not all the workers of iniquity know that they eat up my people, as they eat bread? they call not upon the Lord.", "5": "[d]There they shall be taken with fear, because God is in the generation of the just.", "6": "You have made [e]a mock at the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his trust.", "7": "Oh give salvation unto [f]Israel out of Zion: when the Lord turneth the captivity of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. Note that of Psalm 14:5-7, which are put into the common translation, and may seem unto some to be left out in this, are not in the same Psalm in the Hebrew text, but rather are put in more fully to express the manners of the wicked, and are gathered out of Psalms 5, 10, 36, 140; Isa. 59, and are alleged by S. Paul, and placed together in Romans 3."}

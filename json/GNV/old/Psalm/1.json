{"1": "Whether it was Esdras, or any other that gathered the Psalms into a book, it seemeth he did set this Psalm first in manner of a preface, to exhort all godly men to study and meditate the heavenly wisdom.\u2003 For the effect hereof is, \u20031 That they be blessed which give themselves wholly all their life to the holy Scriptures;\u20034 and that the wicked contemners of God, though they seem for a while happy, yet at length shall come to miserable destruction. Blessed is the man that doth not walk in the [b]counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful.", "2": "But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his [c]law doth he meditate day and night.", "3": "For he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, that will bring forth her fruits in due season: whose leaf shall not fade: so [d]whatsoever he shall do, shall prosper.", "4": "[e]The wicked are not so, but as the chaff, which the wind driveth away.", "5": "Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the [f]judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.", "6": "For the Lord [g]knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish."}

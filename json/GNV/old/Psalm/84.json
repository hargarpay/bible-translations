{"1": "David driven forth of his country,\u2003\u20032 Desireth most ardently to come again to the tabernacle of the Lord and the assembly of the Saints to praise God,\u20034 pronouncing them blessed that may so do.\u20036 Then he praiseth the courage of the people, that pass through the wilderness to assemble themselves in Zion.\u200310 Finally, with praise of this matter and confidence of God's goodness, he endeth the Psalm. O [a]Lord of hosts, how amiable are thy Tabernacles?", "2": "My soul longeth, yea, and fainted for the [b]courts of the Lord: for my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.", "3": "Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for her, where she may lay her young: even by thine [c]altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my God.", "4": "Blessed are they that dwell in thine house, they will ever praise thee. Selah.", "5": "Blessed is the man whose [d]strength is in thee, and in whose heart are thy ways.", "6": "They going through the valley of [e]Baca, make wells therein: the rain also covereth the pools.", "7": "They go from [f]strength to strength, till every one appear before God in Zion.", "8": "O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer, hearken, O God of Jacob. Selah.", "9": "Behold, O God, our shield, and look upon the face of thine [g]Anointed.", "10": "For [h]a day in thy courts is better than a thousand other where: I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tabernacles of wickedness.", "11": "For the Lord God is the sun and shield unto us: the Lord will give grace and glory, and no [i]good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.", "12": "O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee."}

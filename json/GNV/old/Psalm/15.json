{"1": "This Psalm teacheth on what condition God did choose the Jews for his peculiar people; and wherefore he placed his Temple among them, which was to the intent that they by living uprightly and godly, might witness that they were his special and holy people. Lord, who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thine holy Mountain?", "2": "He that [a]walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.", "3": "He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor receiveth a false report against his neighbor.", "4": "[b]In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoreth them that fear the Lord: he that sweareth to his own hindrance and changeth not.", "5": "He that [c]giveth not his money unto usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent: he that doeth these things, [d]shall never be moved."}

{"1": "David after he had been in great danger by Saul in the desert of Ziph, made this Psalm.\u20033 Wherein he giveth thanks to God for his wonderful deliverance, in whose mercies he trusted, even in the midst of his miseries.\u20039 Prophesying the destruction of God's enemies:\u200311 And contrariwise happiness to all them that trust in the Lord. O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: my soul [b]thirsteth for thee: my flesh longeth greatly after thee in a barren and dry land without water:", "2": "Thus [c]I behold thee as in the Sanctuary, when I behold thy power and thy glory.", "3": "For thy loving-kindness is better than life: therefore my lips shall praise thee.", "4": "Thus will I magnify thee all my life, and lift up mine hands in thy Name.", "5": "My soul shall be satisfied, as with [d]marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips,", "6": "When I remember thee on my bed, and when I think upon thee in the night watches.", "7": "Because thou hast been mine helper, therefore under the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.", "8": "My soul [e]cleaveth unto thee: for thy right hand upholdeth me.", "9": "Therefore they that seek my soul to destroy it, they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth.", "10": "[f]They shall cast him down with the edge of the sword, and they shall be a portion for foxes.", "11": "But the king shall rejoice in God, and all that [g]swear by him shall rejoice in him: for the mouth of them that speak lies, shall be stopped."}

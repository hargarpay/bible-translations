Lord, how are mine adversaries [a]increased? how many rise against me?", "2": "Many say to my soul, There is no help for him in God. [b]Selah.", "3": "But thou Lord art a buckler for me, my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.", "4": "I did call unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Selah.", "5": "I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.", "6": "I will not be afraid for [c]ten thousand of the people, that should beset me round about.", "7": "O Lord, arise: help me, my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone: thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.", "8": "[d]Salvation belongeth unto the Lord, and thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah."}

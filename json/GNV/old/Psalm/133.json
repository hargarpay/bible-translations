{"1": "This Psalm containeth the commendation of brotherly amity among the servants of God. Behold, how good and how comely a thing it is, brethren to dwell even [a]together.", "2": "It is like to the precious [b]ointment upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, even unto Aaron's beard, which went down on the border of his garments,", "3": "And as the dew of [c]Hermon which falleth upon the mountains of Zion: for [d]there the Lord appointed the blessing and life forever."}

{"1": "A prayer of the faithful, which were afflicted either in Babylon or under Antiochus, by the wicked worldlings and contemners of God. I lift up mine eyes to thee, that dwellest in the heavens.", "2": "Behold, as the eyes of [a]servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.", "3": "Have mercy unto us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have [b]suffered too much contempt.", "4": "Our soul is filled too full of the mocking of the wealthy, and of the despitefulness of the proud."}

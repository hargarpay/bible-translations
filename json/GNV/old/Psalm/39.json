{"1": "David uttereth with what great grief and bitterness of mind he was driven to these outrageous complaints of his infirmities.\u20032 For he confesseth that when he had determined silence, that he brast forth yet into words, that he would not, through the greatness of his grief.\u20034 Then he rehearseth certain requests which taste of the infirmity of man.\u20038 And mixeth with them many prayers: but all do show a mind wonderfully trembled, that it may plainly appear how he did strive mightily against death and desperation. I thought, [b]I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth bridled, while the wicked is in my sight.", "2": "I was dumb and spake nothing: I kept silence even from good, [c]and my sorrow was more stirred.", "3": "Mine heart was hot within me, and while I was musing, the fire kindled, and I [d]spake with my tongue, saying,", "4": "Lord, let me know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: let me know how long I have to live.", "5": "Behold, thou hast made my days as an hand breadth, and mine age as nothing in respect of thee: surely every man in his best state is altogether [e]vanity. Selah.", "6": "Doubtless man walketh in a shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.", "7": "And now Lord, what wait I for? mine hope is even in thee.", "8": "Deliver me from all my transgressions, and make me not a rebuke unto the [f]foolish.", "9": "I should have been dumb, and not have opened my mouth, because [g]thou didst it.", "10": "Take thy plague away from me: for I am consumed by the stroke of thine hand.", "11": "When thou with rebukes dost chastise man for iniquity, thou as a moth [h]makest his [i]beauty to consume: surely every man is vanity. Selah.", "12": "Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hearken unto my cry: keep not silence at my tears, for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers.", "13": "Stay thine anger from me, that I may recover my strength, [j]before I go hence and be not."}

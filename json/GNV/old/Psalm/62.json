{"1": "This Psalm partly containeth meditation, whereby David encourageth himself to trust in God against the assaults of temptations.\u2003 And because our minds are easily drawn from God by the allurements of the world, he sharply reproveth this vanity, to the intent he might cleave fast to the Lord. Yet [a]my soul keepeth silence unto God; of him cometh my salvation.", "2": "[b]Yet he is my strength and my salvation, and my defense; therefore I shall not much be moved.", "3": "How long will ye imagine mischief against a [c]man? ye shall be all slain; ye shall be as a bowed wall, or as a [d]wall shaken.", "4": "Yet they consult to cast him down from his dignity; their delight is in lies: they bless with their mouths, but curse with their hearts. Selah.", "5": "[e]Yet my soul, keep thou silence unto God: for mine hope is in him.", "6": "Yet is he my strength and my salvation, and my defense: therefore I shall not be moved.", "7": "In God is my salvation and my [f]glory, the rock of my strength; in God is my trust.", "8": "Trust in him always, ye people; [g]pour out your hearts before him, for God is our hope. Selah.", "9": "Yet the children of men are vanity, the chief men are liars: to lay them upon a balance they are altogether lighter than vanity.", "10": "Trust not in oppression nor in robbery: [h]be not vain: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon.", "11": "God spake [i]once or twice, I have heard it, that power belongeth unto God,", "12": "And to thee, O Lord, mercy: for thou [j]rewardest everyone according to his work."}

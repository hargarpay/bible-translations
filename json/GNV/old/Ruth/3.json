Afterward Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall not I seek [a]rest for thee, that thou mayest prosper?", "2": "Now also is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley tonight in the [b]floor.", "3": "Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: let not the [c]man know of thee, until he have left eating and drinking.", "4": "And when he shall sleep, mark the place where he layeth him down, and go, and uncover the place of his feet, and lay thee down, and he shall tell thee what thou shalt do.", "5": "And she answered her, All that thou biddest me, I will do.", "6": "\u00b6 So she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.", "7": "And when Boaz had eaten and drunken, and [d]cheered his heart, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn, and she came softly, and uncovered the place of his feet, and lay down.", "8": "And at midnight the man was afraid [e]and caught hold: and lo, a woman lay at his feet.", "9": "Then he said, Who art thou?

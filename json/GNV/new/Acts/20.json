Now [a]after the tumult was appeased, Paul called the disciples unto him, and embraced them, and departed to go into Macedonia.", "2": "And when he had gone through those parts, and had exhorted them with [b]many words, he came into Greece.", "3": "[c]And having tarried there three months, because the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.", "4": "And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of them of Thessalonica, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and of them of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.", "5": "These went before, and tarried us at Troas.", "6": "And we sailed forth from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.", "7": "[d]And the [e]first day of the week, the disciples being come together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued the preaching unto

Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium: the next day we came to Miletus.", "16": "[g]For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in

grace of God.", "25": "And now behold, I know that henceforth ye all, through whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.", "26": "Wherefore I take you to record this

flock, whereof the holy Ghost hath made you Overseers to [o]feed the Church of God which [p]he hath purchased with [q]that his own blood.", "29": "[r]For I know this, that after my departing shall

{"1": "From whence John's Baptism was.\u20039 The wickedness of the Priests is noted by the parable of the vineyard and the husbandmen.\u200321 To give tribute to Caesar.\u200327 He convinceth the Sadducees denying the resurrection.\u200341 How Christ is the son of David. And [a]it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the Temple, and preached the Gospel, the high Priests and the Scribes came upon him, with the Elders,", "2": "And spake unto him, saying, Tell us by what authority thou doest these things, or who is he that hath given thee this authority?", "3": "And he answered, and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing: tell me therefore: ", "4": "The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? ", "5": "And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will say, Why then believed ye him not?", "6": "But if we shall say, Of men, all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a Prophet.", "7": "Therefore they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.", "8": "Then Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things. ", "9": "\u00b6 [b]Then began he to speak to the people this parable, A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen: and went into a strange country, for a great time. ", "10": "And at the time convenient he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen did beat him, and sent him away empty. ", "11": "Again he sent yet another servant: and they did beat him, and foul entreated him, and sent him away empty. ", "12": "Moreover he sent the third, and him they wounded, and cast out. ", "13": "Then said the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be that they will do reverence when they see him. ", "14": "But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned with themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. ", "15": "So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What shall the Lord of the vineyard therefore do unto them? ", "16": "He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give out his vineyard to others. But when they heard it, they said, God forbid.", "17": "\u00b6 And he beheld them, and said, What meaneth this then that is written, The stone that the builders refused, that is made the head of the corner?

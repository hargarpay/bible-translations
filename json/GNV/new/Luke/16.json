{"1": "The parable of the steward accused to his master.\u200313 To serve two masters.\u200316 The law and the Prophets.\u200319 Of Dives and Lazarus. And he said also unto his disciples, [a]There was a certain rich man, which had a steward, and he was accused unto him, that he wasted his goods. ", "2": "And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship: for thou mayest be no longer steward. ", "3": "Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig, and to beg I am ashamed. ", "4": "I know what I will do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. ", "5": "Then called he unto him everyone of his master's debtors, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my master? ", "6": "And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take thy writing, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. ", "7": "Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. Then he said to him, Take thy writing and write fourscore. ", "8": "And the Lord commended [b]the unjust steward, because he had done wisely. Wherefore the [c]children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. ", "9": "And I say unto you, Make you friends with the riches [d]of iniquity, that when ye shall want, they may receive you into everlasting [e]habitations. ", "10": "[f]He that is faithful in the least, he is also faithful in much: and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much. ", "11": "If then ye have not been faithful in the wicked riches, who will trust you in the [g]true treasure? ", "12": "And if ye have not been faithful in [h]another man's goods, who shall give you that which is yours? ", "13": "[i]No servant can serve two masters: for either he shall hate the one, and love the other: or else he shall lean to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches. ", "14": "All these things heard the Pharisees also which were covetous, and they scoffed at him.", "15": "[j]Then he said unto them, Ye are they, which justify yourselves before men: but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God. ", "16": "[k]The Law and the Prophets endured until John: and since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. ", "17": "Now it is more easy that heaven and earth should pass away, than that one tittle of the Law should fall. ", "18": "\u00b6 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, commiteth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her [l]that is put away from her husband, commiteth adultery. ", "19": "\u00b6 [m]There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in [n]purple and fine linen, and fared well and delicately every day. ", "20": "Also there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full of sores, ", "21": "And desired to be refreshed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table: yea, and the dogs came and licked his sores. ", "22": "And it was so that the beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. ", "23": "And being in hell in torments, [o]he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. ", "24": "Then he cried, and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame. ", "25": "But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus pains: now therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented. ", "26": "Besides all this, between you and us there is a great gulf set, so that they which would go from hence to you, cannot: neither can they come from thence to us. ", "27": "[p]Then he said, I pray thee therefore father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house, ", "28": "(For I have five brethren) that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. ", "29": "Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the Prophets: let them hear them. ", "30": "And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one came unto them from the dead, they will amend their lives. ", "31": "Then he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead again. "}

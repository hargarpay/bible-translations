{"1": "Of the destruction of Jerusalem.\u20039 Persecutions for the Gospel.\u200310 The Gospel must be preached to all nations.\u200326 Of Christ's coming to judgment.\u200333 We must watch and pray. And [a]as he went out of the Temple, one of his disciples said unto him, Master, see what manner stones, and what manner buildings are here. ", "2": "Then Jesus answered and said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down. ", "3": "And as he sat on the mount of Olives, over against the Temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew asked him secretly,", "4": "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?", "5": "And Jesus answered them, and began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you. ", "6": "For many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many. ", "7": "Furthermore when ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be ye not troubled, for such things must needs be: but the end shall not be yet. ", "8": "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in divers quarters, and there shall be famine and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. ", "9": "But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to the Councils, and to the Synagogues: ye shall be beaten, and brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a [b]testimonial unto them. ", "10": "And the Gospel must first be published among all nations. ", "11": "But when they lead you, and deliver you up, [c]be not careful before hand, [d]neither study what ye shall say: but what is given you at the same time, that speak: for it is not you that speak, but the holy Ghost. ", "12": "Yea, and the brother shall deliver the brother to death, and the father the son, and the children shall rise against their parents, and shall cause them to die. ", "13": "And ye shall be hated of all men [e]for my Name's sake: but whosoever shall endure unto the end, he shall be saved. ", "14": "Moreover, when ye shall see the abomination of desolation (spoken of by Daniel the Prophet) [f]set where it ought not, (let him that readeth, consider it) then let them that be in Judea, flee into the mountains. ", "15": "And let him that is upon the house, not come down into the house, neither enter therein, to fetch anything out of his house. ", "16": "And let him that is in the field, not turn back again to take his garment. ", "17": "Then woe shall be to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days. ", "18": "Pray therefore that your flight be not in the winter. ", "19": "For [g]those days shall be such tribulation, as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be. ", "20": "And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, which he hath chosen, he hath shortened those days. ", "21": "Then if any man say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or lo, he is there, believe it not. ", "22": "For false Christs shall rise, and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, to deceive if it were possible the very elect. ", "23": "But take ye heed: behold, I have showed you all things before. ", "24": "\u00b6 Moreover in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall wax dark, and the moon shall not give her light, ", "25": "And the stars of heaven shall fall: and the powers which are in heaven, shall shake. ", "26": "And then shall they see the Son of man, coming in the clouds, with great power and glory. ", "27": "And he shall then send his Angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, and from the utmost part of the earth to the utmost part of heaven. ", "28": "Now learn a parable of the fig tree. When her bough is yet tender, and it bringeth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near. ", "29": "So in like manner, when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near, even at the doors. ", "30": "Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. ", "31": "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. ", "32": "[h]But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels which are in heaven, neither the Son himself, but the Father. ", "33": "Take heed: watch, and pray: for ye know not when the time is. ", "34": "For the Son of man is as a man going into a strange country, and leaveth his house, and giveth authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commandeth the porter to watch. ", "35": "Watch ye therefore, (for ye know not when the master of the house will come, at even, or at midnight, at the cock crowing, or in the dawning,) ", "36": "Lest if he come suddenly, he should find you sleeping. ", "37": "And those things that I say unto you, I say unto all men, Watch. "}

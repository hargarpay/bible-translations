{"1": "The drift and end of this Epistle, is to show that Jesus Christ the Son of God both God and man, is that true eternal and only Prophet, King, and high Priest, that was shadowed by the figures of the old Law, and is now indeed exhibited: of whom the whole Church ought to be taught, governed and sanctified. To show that the doctrine which Christ brought, is most excellent, in that it is the knitting up of all prophecies,\u20034 he advanceth him above the Angels:\u200310 And proveth by divers testimonies of the Scripture, that he far passeth all others. At [a]sundry times and in divers manners God spake in the old time to our fathers by the Prophets: in these [b]last days he hath spoken unto us by his [c]Son,", "2": "[d]Whom he hath made [e]heir of all things, by whom also he made the [f]worlds,", "3": "Who being the [g]brightness of the glory, and the engraved form of his [h]person, and [i]bearing up all things by his mighty word: [j]hath by himself purged our sins: and [k]sitteth at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest places,", "4": "[l]And is made so much more excellent than the Angels, inasmuch as he hath obtained a more excellent [m]Name than they.", "5": "[n]For unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, [o]this day begat I thee? and again, I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son:", "6": "And [p]again, when he bringeth in his first begotten Son into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship him.", "7": "And of the Angels he saith, He maketh the spirits his [q]messengers, and his ministers a flame [r]of fire.", "8": "But unto the Son he saith, O God, thy [s]throne is forever [t]and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a [u]scepter of righteousness.", "9": "Thou hast loved righteousness and [v]hated iniquity. Wherefore God, even thy God, hath [w]anointed thee with the oil of gladness, above thy [x]fellows.", "10": "And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast [y]established the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands.", "11": "They shall perish, but thou dost remain, and they all shall wax old as doth a garment,", "12": "And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.", "13": "Unto which also of the Angels said he at any time, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?", "14": "Are they not all [z]ministering spirits, sent forth to minister, for their sakes which shall be heirs of salvation?"}

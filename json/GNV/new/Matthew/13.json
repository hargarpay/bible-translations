", "4": "And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up. ", "5": "And some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth, and anon they sprung up, because they had no depth of earth.

", "26": "And when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

", "30": "Let both grow together until the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in sheaves to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. ", "31": "\u00b6 [f]Another parable he put forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man taketh and soweth in his field: ", "32": "Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and it is a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and build in the branches thereof.

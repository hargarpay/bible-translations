The same time the disciples came unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?", "2": "[a]And Jesus called a [b]little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,", "3": "And said, Verily I say unto you, except ye be [c]converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. ", "4": "Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ", "5": "And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my Name, receiveth me. ", "6": "[d]But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. ", "7": "[e]Woe be unto the world because of offences, for it must needs be that [f]offences shall come, but woe be to that man by whom the offence cometh. ", "8": "Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foot cause thee to [g]offend, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life, halt, or maimed, than having two hands, or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire. ", "9": "And if thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. ", "10": "[h]See that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, that in heaven their Angels always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. ", "11": "For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. ", "12": "How think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave ninety and nine, and go into the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray? ", "13": "And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray: ", "14": "So is it not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. ", "15": "\u00b6 [i]Moreover, if thy brother trespass against [j]thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast won thy brother. ", "16": "But if he hear thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the [k]mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be [l]confirmed. ", "17": "[m]And if he [n]refuse to hear them, tell it unto the [o]Church: and if he refuse to hear the Church also, let him be unto thee as an [p]heathen man, and a Publican. ", "18": "Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. ", "19": "Again, verily I say unto you, that if two of you shall [q]agree in earth upon anything, whatsoever they shall desire, it shall be given them of my Father which is in heaven. ", "20": "For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them. ", "21": "[r]Then came Peter to him, and said, Master, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I shall forgive him? unto seven times?", "22": "Jesus said unto him, I say not to thee, Unto seven times, but, Unto seventy times seven times. ", "23": "Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain King, which would take an account of his servants. ", "24": "And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which ought him [s]ten thousand talents. ", "25": "And because he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the debt to be paid. ", "26": "The servant therefore fell down, and [t]worshipped him, saying, Lord, [u]refrain thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all. ", "27": "Then that servant's lord had compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. ", "28": "But when the servant was departed, he found one of his fellow servants which ought him an hundred pence, and he laid hands on him, and throttled him, saying, Pay me that thou owest. ", "29": "Then his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Refrain thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all. ", "30": "Yet he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. ", "31": "And when his other fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came, and declared unto their lord all that was done. ", "32": "Then his lord called him unto him, and said to him, O evil servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou prayedst me. ", "33": "Oughtest not thou also to have had pity on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? ", "34": "So his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him. ", "35": "So likewise shall mine heavenly Father do unto you, except ye forgive from your hearts, each one to his brother their trespasses. "}

{"1": "The first Epistle sent to the Pastors of the Church of Sardis,\u20037 of Philadelphia,\u200314 And of the Laodiceans,\u200316 that they be not lukewarm,\u200320 but endeavor to further God's glory. [a]And write unto the Angel of the Church which is at [b]Sardis, These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars, [c]I know thy works: for thou hast a [d]name that thou livest, but thou art dead. ", "2": "Be awake, and strengthen the things which remain, that are [e]ready to die: for I have not found thy work perfect before God. ", "3": "Remember therefore, how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If therefore thou wilt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. ", "4": "Notwithstanding thou hast a few names yet in Sardis, [f]which have not defiled their garments: and they shall walk with me in [g]white: for they are [h]worthy. ", "5": "He [i]that overcometh, shall be clothed in white array, and I will not put out his Name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his Angels. ", "6": "Let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches. ", "7": "\u00b6 [j]And write unto the Angel of the Church which is of Philadelphia, These things saith he that is Holy, and True, which hath the [k]key of David, which openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth. ", "8": "[l]I know thy works: behold I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my Name. ", "9": "Behold, I will make them [m]of the Synagogue of Satan, which call themselves Jews, and are not, but do lie: behold, I say, I will make them that they shall come [n]and worship before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee. ", "10": "Because thou hast [o]kept the word of my patience, therefore I will deliver thee from the hour of tentation, which will come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. ", "11": "Behold, I come shortly: hold that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. ", "12": "[p]Him that overcometh, will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: [q]and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new Name. ", "13": "Let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.

", "16": "Therefore because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, it will come to pass, that I shall spew thee out of my mouth. ", "17": "For thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not how thou art wretched and miserable, [v]and poor, and blind, and naked. ", "18": "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried by the fire, that thou mayest be made rich: and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that thy filthy nakedness do not appear: and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see. ", "19": "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be [w]zealous therefore and amend. ", "20": "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock, [x]If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me. ", "21": "[y]To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I overcame, and sit with my Father in his throne. ", "22": "Let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches. "}

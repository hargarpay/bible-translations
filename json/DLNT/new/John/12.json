{"1": "Therefore Jesus, six days before the Passover [Feast], came to Bethany where Lazarus was, the one whom Jesus raised from the dead. ", "2": "So they made a dinner for Him there. And Martha was serving. And Lazarus was one of the ones reclining-back [to eat] with Him. ", "3": "Then Mary, having taken a pound of very-valuable genuine[a] nard perfume, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled from the aroma of the perfume. ", "4": "But Judas the Iscariot\u2014 one of His disciples, the one going to hand Him over\u2014 says, ", "5": "\u201cFor what reason was this perfume not sold for three-hundred denarii[b] and given to poor ones?\u201d ", "6": "Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. And having the money-box, he was carrying[c] the things being put there. ", "7": "So Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone. It was[d] in order that she might keep it for the day of My preparation-for-burial. ", "8": "For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me\u201d. ", "9": "Then the large crowd[e] of the Jews came-to-know that He was there. And they came\u2014 not because of Jesus only, but in order that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead. ", "10": "And the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also, ", "11": "because many of the Jews were going-away and were believing in Jesus because of him.", "12": "On the next day the large crowd[f]\u2014 the one having come to the Feast\u2014 having heard[g] that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, ", "13": "took the branches of palm-trees and came out to meet Him. And they were shouting, \u201cHosanna! Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel\u201d. ", "14": "And Jesus, having found a young-donkey, sat on it, just as it has been written [in Zech 9:9]: ", "15": "\u201cDo not be fearing, daughter of Zion. Behold\u2014 your King is coming, sitting on a colt of a donkey\u201d. ", "16": "His disciples did not understand these things at first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written for[h] Him, and that they did these things to Him. ", "17": "Then the crowd[i] was testifying\u2014 the one being with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead. ", "18": "For this reason also the crowd[j] met Him\u2014 because they heard that He had done this sign. ", "19": "Then the Pharisees said to themselves, \u201cYou see that you are profiting nothing! Look\u2014 the world went after Him!\u201d", "20": "Now some of the ones going up in order that they might worship at the Feast were Greeks[k]. ", "21": "So these ones came to Philip, the one from Bethsaida of Galilee, and were asking him, saying, \u201cSir, we wish to see Jesus\u201d. ", "22": "Philip comes and tells Andrew. Andrew and Philip come, and they tell Jesus. ", "23": "And Jesus responds to them, saying, \u201cThe hour has come for[l] the Son of Man to be glorified. ", "24": "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the seed of wheat having fallen to the earth dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. ", "25": "The one loving his life loses it, and the one hating his life in this world will keep[m] it for eternal life. ", "26": "If anyone serves Me, let him be following Me. And where I am, there also My servant will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. ", "27": "Now My soul has been troubled. And what should I say\u2014 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour! ", "28": "Father, glorify Your name!\u201d Then a voice came from heaven: \u201cI both glorified it, and will again glorify it\u201d. ", "29": "Then the crowd, the one standing there and having heard, was saying that thunder had taken place. Others were saying, \u201cAn angel has spoken to Him\u201d. ", "30": "Jesus responded and said, \u201cThis voice has taken place not for My sake, but for your sakes. ", "31": "Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be cast out! ", "32": "And if I am lifted-up[n] from the earth, I will draw all people to Myself \u201d. ", "33": "Now He was saying this signifying by what-kind-of death He was going to die.", "34": "Then the crowd responded to Him, \u201cWe heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How indeed do You say that 'The Son of Man must be lifted-up[o]'? Who is this Son of Man?\u201d ", "35": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cThe Light is among you for a short time longer. Be walking while you have the Light, in order that darkness may not overtake you. Indeed the one walking in the darkness does not know where he is going. ", "36": "While you have the Light, be believing in the Light, in order that you may become sons of Light\u201d. Jesus spoke these things, and having gone away, was hidden from them.", "37": "Now He having done so-many[p] signs in front of them[q]\u2014 they were not believing in Him, ", "38": "in order that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke [in Isa 53:1]: \u201cLord, who believed our report? And to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?\u201d ", "39": "For this reason[r] they were not able to believe: because again Isaiah said [in Isa 6:10] ", "40": "\u201cHe has blinded their eyes, and He hardened their heart, in order that they might not see with their eyes, and comprehend in their heart, and be turned, and I shall heal them\u201d.

But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing it in order that they might not become put-out-of-the-synagogue. ", "43": "For they loved the glory of people more[s] than the glory of God.", "44": "And[t] Jesus cried-out and said \u201cThe one believing in Me is not believing in Me, but in the One having sent Me.

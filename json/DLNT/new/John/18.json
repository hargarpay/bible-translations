{"1": "Having said these things, Jesus went-out with His disciples to the other side of the ravine[a] of Kidron where there was a garden, into which He entered, He and His disciples. ", "2": "Now Judas, the one handing Him over, also knew the place, because Jesus often was gathered there with His disciples. ", "3": "So Judas\u2014 having received[b] the [Roman] cohort[c], and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees\u2014 comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons. ", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing all the things coming upon Him, went forth. And He says to them, \u201cWhom are you seeking?\u201d ", "5": "They answered Him, \u201cJesus the Nazarene\u201d. He says to them, \u201cI am He\u201d. Now Judas, the one handing Him over, was also standing there with them. ", "6": "So when He said to them, \u201cI am He\u201d, they[d] went back, and fell on the ground. ", "7": "Then He again asked them, \u201cWhom are you seeking?\u201d And the ones said, \u201cJesus the Nazarene\u201d. ", "8": "Jesus responded, \u201cI told you that I am He. If then you are seeking Me, permit these ones to go\u201d\u2014 ", "9": "in order that the word which He spoke[e] might be fulfilled, that \u201cThe ones whom You have given Me\u2014 I did not lose any of them\u201d. ", "10": "Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and hit the slave of the high priest, and cut-off his right ear. And the name for the slave was Malchus. ", "11": "Then Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut the sword into the sheath. The cup which the Father has given Me\u2014 shall not I drink it?\u201d", "12": "Then the [Roman] cohort and its commander[f], and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus, and bound Him. ", "13": "And they led Him to Annas first. For he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest of that year. ", "14": "And Caiaphas was the one having counseled[g] the Jews that it was better that one Man die for the people.", "15": "Now Simon Peter and another disciple[h] were following Jesus. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. ", "16": "But Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, the one known by the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought in Peter. ", "17": "Then the doorkeeper servant-girl says to Peter, \u201cYou are not also one of the disciples of this man, are you?\u201d That one says, \u201cI am not\u201d. ", "18": "And the slaves and the officers, having made a charcoal-fire because it was cold, were standing there and warming themselves. And Peter was also with them, standing there and warming himself.", "19": "So the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching. ", "20": "Jesus answered him, \u201cI have spoken in public to the world. I always taught at synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. And I spoke nothing in secret. ", "21": "Why are you questioning Me? Question the ones having heard what I spoke to them. Look, these ones know the things which I said\u201d. ", "22": "And He having said these things, one of the officers standing near gave Jesus a slap[i], having said, \u201cIn this manner do you answer the high priest?\u201d ", "23": "Jesus answered him, \u201cIf I spoke wrongly, testify about the thing wrong. But if I spoke rightly, why do you beat Me?\u201d ", "24": "Then Annas sent Him forth, having been bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "And Simon Peter is standing there and warming himself. So they said to him, \u201cYou are not also one of His disciples, are you?\u201d That one denied it and said, \u201cI am not\u201d. ", "26": "One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one of whom Peter cut-off the ear, says, \u201cDid I not see you in the garden with Him?\u201d ", "27": "Then again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed.", "28": "Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium[j]. And it was early-morning. And they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium in order that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover [Feast][k].", "29": "So Pilate went outside to them. And he says, \u201cWhat accusation do you bring against this man?\u201d ", "30": "They responded and said to him, \u201cIf this One were not doing wrong[l], we would not have handed Him over to you\u201d. ", "31": "So Pilate said to them, \u201cYou take Him and judge Him according to your Law\u201d. The Jews said to him, \u201cIt is not lawful[m] for us to execute anyone\u201d\u2014 ", "32": "in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke signifying[n] by what kind of death He was going to die.", "33": "So Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus. And he said to Him, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d ", "34": "Jesus answered, \u201cAre you saying this from yourself, or did others tell you about Me?\u201d ", "35": "Pilate answered, \u201cI am not a Jew, am I? Your nation[o] and the chief priests handed You over to me. What did You do?\u201d ", "36": "Jesus answered, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would be fighting in order that I might not be handed-over to the Jews. But as-it-is[p], My kingdom is not from here\u201d. ", "37": "Therefore Pilate said to Him, \u201cSo-then You are a king?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou are saying[q] that[r] I am a king. I have been born for this. And I have come into the world for this: that I might testify to the truth. Everyone being of the truth hears[s] My voice\u201d. ", "38": "Pilate says to Him, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d And having said this, he again went out to the Jews. And he says to them, \u201cI find no charge[t] in[u] Him. ", "39": "But it is a custom for you that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover [Feast]. So do you wish me to release the King of the Jews for you?\u201d ", "40": "Then they shouted back[v], saying, \u201cNot this One, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a robber[w]. "}

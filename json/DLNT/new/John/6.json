{"1": "After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee\u2014 of Tiberias[a]. ", "2": "And a large crowd was following Him, because they were seeing the signs which He was doing on the ones being sick. ", "3": "And Jesus went up on the mountain, and was sitting there with His disciples. ", "4": "And the Passover, the Feast of the Jews, was near. ", "5": "Then Jesus, having lifted-up His eyes and seen that a large crowd was coming to Him, says to Philip, \u201cFrom where may we buy bread in order that these ones may eat?\u201d ", "6": "Now He was saying this testing him. For He Himself knew what He was going to do. ", "7": "Philip answered Him, \u201cLoaves worth two-hundred denarii[b] are not enough for them, in order that each one may receive a little bit\u201d. ", "8": "One of His disciples\u2014 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter\u2014 says to Him, ", "9": "\u201cThere is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many?\u201d ", "10": "Jesus said, \u201cMake the people fall-back [to eat]\u201d. And there was much grass in the place. So the men\u2014 about five-thousand as to the number\u2014 fell back [to eat]. ", "11": "Then Jesus took the loaves. And having given-thanks, He distributed them to the ones reclining-back [to eat]\u2014 likewise also from the fish\u2014 as much as they were wanting. ", "12": "And when they were filled, He says to His disciples, \u201cGather the left-over fragments so that nothing may be lost\u201d. ", "13": "So they gathered, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over by the ones having eaten. ", "14": "Therefore the people, having seen the sign which He did, were saying that \u201cThis One is truly the Prophet[c] coming into the world\u201d.

", "17": "And having gotten into a boat, they were going to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum. And darkness already had come, and Jesus had not-yet come to them. ", "18": "And the sea was becoming aroused from a great wind blowing. ", "19": "So having rowed about twenty five or thirty stades[d], they see Jesus walking on the sea and becoming near the boat. And they became afraid. ", "20": "But the One says to them, \u201cI am[e] the One. Do not be afraid\u201d. ", "21": "So they were willing to take Him into the boat. And immediately the boat came-to-be at the land to which they were going.", "22": "On the next day the crowd standing on the other side of the sea saw that there had not been another small boat there except [the] one, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone. ", "23": "Other[f] small-boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread, the Lord having given-thanks. ", "24": "So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they got into the small boats, and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.", "25": "And having found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, \u201cRabbi, when have You come here?\u201d ", "26": "Jesus responded to them and said, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you\u2014 you are seeking Me not because you saw signs[g], but because you ate of the loaves-of-bread and were filled-to-satisfaction. ", "27": "Do not be working for the food which is perishing, but for the food which is remaining to[h] eternal life\u2014 which the Son of Man will give to you.

What thing do you work? ", "31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it has been written [in Ps 78:24]: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat'\u201d. ", "32": "So Jesus said to them, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven, but My Father is giving you the true Bread from heaven. ", "33": "For the bread of God is the One coming[j] down from heaven and giving life to the world\u201d.", "34": "So they said to Him, \u201cMaster, give us this bread always\u201d. ", "35": "Jesus said to them, \u201cI am the bread of life. The one coming to Me will never hunger, and the one believing in Me will never ever[k] thirst.

", "37": "All that the Father gives to Me will come to Me, and I will never[m] throw outside the one coming to Me.

", "39": "And this is the will of the One having sent Me: that as to all that He has given to Me, I will not lose anything from it, but I will raise it up on the last day.

How does He now say that 'I have come down from heaven'?\u201d ", "43": "Jesus responded and said to them, \u201cDo not be grumbling with one another. ", "44": "No one is able to come to Me unless the Father having sent Me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.

If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And indeed the bread which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh\u201d.", "52": "Then the Jews were fighting with one another, saying, \u201cHow can this One give us His flesh to eat?\u201d ", "53": "So Jesus said to them, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you, unless[n] you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.

Who can hear[q] it?\u201d ", "61": "But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples are grumbling about this, said to them, \u201cDoes this offend you?

The words which I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life. ", "64": "But there are some of you who do not believe\u201d. For Jesus knew from the beginning who the ones not believing were, and who the one who will hand Him over was. ", "65": "And He was saying, \u201cFor this reason I have said to you that no one is able to come to Me unless it has been granted to him from the Father\u201d.", "66": "From this time, many of His disciples went back, and were no longer walking with Him.

You have the words of eternal life. ", "69": "And we have believed, and have come-to-know that You are the Holy One of God\u201d.

{"1": "After these things there was a Feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ", "2": "Now in Jerusalem near the Sheep gate, there is a pool\u2014 the one being called Bethzatha in Hebrew, having five porticos[a]. ", "3": "In these porticos, a multitude of the ones being sick were lying-down\u2014 blind ones, lame ones, withered ones. ", "4": "[b] ", "5": "And there was a certain man there having thirty and eight years in his sickness. ", "6": "Jesus\u2014 having seen this one lying down, and having known[c] that he already had a long time [in his sickness]\u2014 says to him, \u201cDo you want to become healthy?\u201d ", "7": "The one being sick answered Him, \u201cSir, I do not have a man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred-up. But while I am going, another goes down before me\u201d. ", "8": "Jesus says to him, \u201cArise, pick up your cot and walk!\u201d ", "9": "And immediately the man became healthy, and picked up his cot and was walking. Now it was a Sabbath on that day. ", "10": "So the Jews were saying to the one having been cured, \u201cIt is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to pick up your cot\u201d. ", "11": "But the one answered them, \u201cThe One having made me healthy, that One said to me, 'Pick up your cot and walk'\u201d.

For Jesus withdrew, a crowd being in the place. ", "14": "After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple. And He said to him, \u201cSee\u2014 you have become healthy! Do not be sinning any longer in order that something worse may not happen to you\u201d. ", "15": "The man went away and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the One having made him healthy. ", "16": "And for this reason, the Jews were persecuting Jesus\u2014 because He was doing these things on a Sabbath. ", "17": "But Jesus answered them, \u201cMy Father is working until now, and[d] I am working\u201d. ", "18": "Therefore, for this reason the Jews were seeking more to kill Him: because He was not only breaking[e] the Sabbath, but He was also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal[f] to God! ", "19": "Therefore Jesus responded and was saying to them\u2014 \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you\u2014 the Son can do nothing from Himself except[g] something He sees the Father doing. For whatever things that One is doing, these things the Son is also likewise doing. ", "20": "For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing. And He will show Him greater works than these, in order that you may marvel.", "21": "\u201cFor[h] just as the Father raises the dead and gives-life-to them, so also the Son gives-life-to the ones whom He wishes[i].

The one not honoring the Son is not honoring the Father having sent Him. ", "24": "Truly, truly, I say to you that the one hearing My word and believing the One having sent Me has eternal life. And he does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.", "25": "\u201cTruly, truly, I say to you that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones having heard will live.

For the works which the Father has given to Me that I should accomplish them\u2014 the works themselves which I am doing are testifying about Me, that the Father has sent Me forth.

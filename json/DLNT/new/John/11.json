{"1": "Now there was a certain one being sick\u2014 Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha, her sister. ", "2": "And it was Mary, the one having anointed[a] the Lord with perfume and having wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. ", "3": "So the sisters sent out a message to Him, saying, \u201cLord, look\u2014 the one whom You love is sick\u201d. ", "4": "And having heard, Jesus said \u201cThis sickness is not leading to death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it\u201d.", "5": "Now Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. ", "6": "So when He heard that he was sick, at that time He remained for two days in which place He was\u2014 ", "7": "then after this, says to the disciples, \u201cLet us be going to Judea again\u201d. ", "8": "The disciples say to Him, \u201cRabbi, the Jews were just-now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?\u201d ", "9": "Jesus answered, \u201cAre there not twelve hours of the day? If one walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. ", "10": "But if one walks during the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him\u201d. ", "11": "He said these things, and after this He says to them, \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen-asleep, but I am going in order that I may awaken him\u201d. ", "12": "So the disciples said to Him, \u201cLord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be restored\u201d. ", "13": "Now Jesus had spoken concerning his death, but those ones thought that He was speaking concerning the sleep of slumber[b]. ", "14": "So at-that-time Jesus said to them with plainness, \u201cLazarus died. ", "15": "And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us be going to him\u201d. ", "16": "Then Thomas, the one being called Didymus[c], said to his fellow-disciples, \u201cLet us indeed be going, so that we may die with Him[d]\u201d.", "17": "So having come, Jesus found him already having four days in the tomb. ", "18": "Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stades[e] away. ", "19": "And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary in order that they might console them concerning their brother. ", "20": "So Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met Him. But Mary was sitting in the house. ", "21": "Then Martha said to Jesus, \u201cLord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. ", "22": "But even now I know that whatever You ask God, God will give You\u201d. ", "23": "Jesus says to her, \u201cYour brother will rise-up\u201d. ", "24": "Martha says to Him, \u201cI know that he will rise-up in the resurrection at the last day\u201d. ", "25": "Jesus said to her, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The one believing in Me\u2014 even though he dies, he will live. ", "26": "And everyone living and believing in Me will never die, ever. Do you believe this?\u201d ", "27": "She says to Him, \u201cYes, Lord. I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming into the world\u201d. ", "28": "And having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, having said, \u201cThe Teacher is here and is calling you\u201d. ", "29": "And that one, when she heard, arose quickly and was going to Him. ", "30": "Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him. ", "31": "So the Jews\u2014 the ones being with her in the house and consoling her\u2014having seen that Mary stood up quickly and went out, followed her, having supposed that she was going to the tomb in order that she might weep there. ", "32": "Then Mary\u2014 when she came where Jesus was, having seen Him\u2014 fell at His feet, saying to Him, \u201cLord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died\u201d. ", "33": "Then Jesus\u2014 when He saw her weeping, and the Jews having come with her weeping\u2014 was deeply-moved[f] in His spirit, and troubled[g] Himself. ", "34": "And He said, \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They say to Him, \u201cLord, come and see\u201d. ", "35": "Jesus wept. ", "36": "So the Jews were saying, \u201cLook\u2014 how He was loving him!\u201d ", "37": "And[h] some of them said, \u201cWas not this One\u2014 the One having opened the eyes of the blind one\u2014 able to cause that this one also should not die?\u201d", "38": "Then Jesus, again being deeply-moved in Himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon[i] it. ", "39": "Jesus says, \u201cTake away the stone\u201d. Martha, the sister of the one having come-to-an-end[j], says to Him, \u201cLord, he already stinks, for it is the fourth-day\u201d. ", "40": "Jesus says to her, \u201cDid I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?\u201d ", "41": "So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted His eyes upward, and said, \u201cFather, I thank You that You heard Me. ", "42": "Now I knew that You always hear Me. But I said this for the sake of the crowd having stood around\u2014 in order that they may believe that You sent Me forth\u201d. ", "43": "And having said these things, He shouted with a loud voice, \u201cLazarus, come outside!\u201d ", "44": "The one having died came out, having been bound as to the feet and the hands with grave-cloths. And his face had been bound-around with a face-cloth. Jesus says to them, \u201cUnbind him, and allow him to go\u201d. ", "45": "Therefore many of the Jews\u2014 the ones having come to Mary, and having seen the things which He did\u2014 believed in Him.", "46": "But some[k] of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus did. ", "47": "So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together a council[l]. And they were saying, \u201cWhat are we doing? Because this man is doing many signs! ", "48": "If we tolerate Him in this manner, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place[m] and nation\u201d. ", "49": "But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest of that year, said to them, \u201cYou do not know anything\u2014 ", "50": "nor do you consider that it is better for you that one Man die for the people, and the whole nation not perish\u201d. ", "51": "Now he did not say this from himself, but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation. ", "52": "And not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God having been scattered [in the world]. ", "53": "Therefore from that day, they planned to kill Him.", "54": "Therefore Jesus was no longer walking in public among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city being called Ephraim. And He stayed there with the disciples.", "55": "Now the Passover [Feast] of the Jews was near. And many went up to Jerusalem from the country[n] before the Passover [Feast], in order that they might purify themselves. ", "56": "So they were seeking Jesus, and saying, standing with one another in the temple, \u201cWhat seems right to you\u2014 that He will by no means come to the Feast?\u201d ", "57": "And the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands that if anyone came-to-know where He was, he should disclose it\u2014 so that they might seize Him."}

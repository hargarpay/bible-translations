", "4": "And He had-to go through Samaria.", "5": "So He comes into a city of Samaria being called Sychar, near the place which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. ", "6": "Now a spring of Jacob was there. So Jesus, having become weary from the journey, was sitting thus[c] at the spring. The hour was about the sixth[d].", "7": "A woman of Samaria comes to draw water. Jesus says to her, \u201cGive Me water to drink\u201d. ", "8": "For His disciples had gone into the city in order that they might buy food. ", "9": "So the Samaritan woman says to Him, \u201cHow is it You, being a Jew, are asking something to drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?\u201d For Jews do not use-things-together-with[e] Samaritans. ", "10": "Jesus responded and said to her, \u201cIf you knew the gift of God, and Who the One saying to you 'Give Me water to drink' is\u2014 you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water\u201d.

Jesus says to her, \u201cYou said rightly that 'I do not have a husband'. ", "18": "For you had five husbands. And now he whom you have is not your husband. You have spoken this as a true thing\u201d. ", "19": "The woman says to Him, \u201cSir, I perceive that You are a prophet.

This One is not the Christ, is He?\u201d ", "30": "They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.", "31": "In the meantime the disciples were asking Him, saying, \u201cRabbi, eat\u201d.

", "42": "And they were saying to the woman that \u201cWe are no longer believing because of your speaking. For we ourselves have heard, and we know that this One is truly the Savior of the world\u201d. ", "43": "And after the two days, He went forth from there to Galilee.

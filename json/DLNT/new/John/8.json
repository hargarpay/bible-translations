", "3": "And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman having been caught in adultery. And having stood her in the middle, ", "4": "they say to Him, \u201cTeacher, this woman has been caught in the-act, while committing-adultery. ", "5": "Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to be stoning such women[a]. What then do You say?\u201d ", "6": "Now they were saying this testing Him, in order that they might have grounds to be accusing Him. But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing in the ground with His finger. ", "7": "But as they were continuing-on asking Him, He straightened-up and said to them, \u201cLet the sinless one among you throw a stone at her first\u201d. ", "8": "And again having stooped-down, He was writing in the ground. ", "9": "And the ones, having heard it, were going out one by one, beginning from the older ones. And He was left-behind alone, and the woman being in the middle. ", "10": "And Jesus, having straightened up, said to her, \u201cWoman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?\u201d ", "11": "And the one said, \u201cNo one, Sir\u201d. And Jesus said, \u201cNeither do I condemn[b] you. Go. And from now on, do not be sinning any longer\u201d.", "12": "Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, \u201cI am the light of the world. The one following Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of\u00a0[c] life\u201d.

", "14": "Jesus responded and said to them, \u201cEven if I am testifying about Myself, My testimony is true, because I know from where I came, and where I am going. But you do not know from where I come, or where I am going. ", "15": "You are judging according to the flesh. I am not judging anyone. ", "16": "But even if I am judging, My judgment is true, because I am not alone\u2014 but it is I and the Father having sent Me. ", "17": "But even in your Law, it has been written that the testimony of two people is true. ", "18": "I am the One testifying about Myself. And the Father having sent Me is testifying about Me\u201d. ", "19": "So they were saying to Him, \u201cWhere is Your Father?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would also know My Father\u201d. ", "20": "These words He spoke in the treasury, while teaching in the temple. And no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.", "21": "Then He said again to them, \u201cI am going away. And you will seek Me. And you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you are not able to come\u201d. ", "22": "So the Jews were saying, \u201cHe will not kill Himself, will He\u2014 because He says, 'Where I am going, you are not able to come'?\u201d ", "23": "And He was saying to them, \u201cYou are from below, I am from above. You are from this world, I am not from this world. ", "24": "Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am[d] the One, you will die in your sins\u201d.", "25": "So they were saying to Him, \u201cWho[e] are You?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cWhat[f] thing from the beginning I am indeed telling you! ", "26": "I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However, the One having sent Me is true. And what things I heard from Him\u2014 these things I am speaking to the world\u201d. ", "27": "They did not know that He was speaking to them about the Father.", "28": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cWhen you lift-up[g] the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the One, and I am doing nothing from Myself, but I am speaking these things just as the Father taught Me.

", "30": "While He was speaking these things, many believed in Him.", "31": "Then Jesus was saying to the Jews having believed Him, \u201cIf you remain[h] in My word, you are truly My disciples, ", "32": "and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\u201d.", "33": "They responded to Him, \u201cWe are the seed of Abraham, and to no one have we ever been slaves[i]. How is it You say that 'You will become free'?\u201d ", "34": "Jesus answered them, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you that everyone doing[j] sin is a slave of sin.

And you therefore are doing[n] the things which you heard from your father\u201d.", "39": "They responded and said to Him, \u201cOur father is Abraham\u201d. Jesus says to them, \u201cIf you are children of Abraham, you would be doing the works of Abraham. ", "40": "But now[o] you are seeking to kill Me\u2014 a man Who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. ", "41": "You are doing the works of your father\u201d. So they said to Him, \u201cWe have not been born out of sexuality-immorality; we have one father\u2014 God\u201d. ", "42": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf God were your Father, you would be loving Me, for I came-forth and am-here from God. For I have not even come of Myself, but that One sent Me forth.

And you are wanting[p] to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer from the beginning, and was not standing[q] in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks the lie[r], he speaks from his own things, because he is a liar, and the father of it. ", "45": "And because I am speaking the truth, you are not believing Me. ", "46": "Which of you convicts Me concerning sin? If I am speaking truth, for what reason are you not believing Me? ", "47": "The one being of\u00a0[s] God hears the words of God. For this reason you are not hearing\u2014 because you are not of God\u201d.", "48": "The Jews responded and said to Him, \u201cDo we not rightly say that You are a Samaritan[t] and have a demon?\u201d ", "49": "Jesus answered, \u201cI do not have a demon, but I am honoring My Father, and you are dishonoring Me.

The prophets died also. Whom do You make Yourself ?\u201d ", "54": "Jesus answered, \u201cIf I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. The One glorifying Me is My Father\u2014 Whom you say that 'He is our God'. ", "55": "And you have not come-to-know Him, but I know Him.

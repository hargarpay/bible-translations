{"1": "And one of the seven angels having the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, \u201cCome, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute sitting on many waters, ", "2": "with whom the kings of the earth committed-sexual-immorality, and the ones dwelling-in the earth[a] got-drunk from the wine of her sexual-immorality\u201d. ", "3": "And he carried me away in the Spirit[b] to a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast being-full-of names of\u00a0[c] blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns. ", "4": "And the woman had been clothed-with[d] purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold, and with precious stone and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand being-full of abominations[e] and[f] the impure things of her sexual-immorality, ", "5": "and a name having been written upon her forehead, a mystery[g]: \u201cBabylon the Great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth\u201d. ", "6": "And I saw the woman being-drunk from the blood of the saints, and[h] from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And having seen her, I wondered with great wonder. ", "7": "And the angel said to me, \u201cFor what reason do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast carrying her\u2014 the one having the seven heads and the ten horns. ", "8": "The beast which you saw was and is not and is going to come-up out of the abyss. And he goes to destruction. And the ones dwelling upon the earth whose name has not been written on the book of life since the foundation of the world will be caused-to-marvel while seeing the beast, because he was and is not and will be present[i]. ", "9": "Here[j] is the mind having wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains where the woman sits on them, and they are seven kings. ", "10": "The five fell, the one is, the other did not yet come. And when he comes, he must remain a short time. ", "11": "And the beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth. And he is from[k] the seven. And he goes to destruction.

{"1": "And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, having been clothed-with a cloud. And the rainbow[a] was over[b] his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire. ", "2": "And he was holding[c] in his hand an opened little-scroll. And he placed his right foot upon the sea and the left one upon the land, ", "3": "and he cried-out with a loud voice\u2014 as indeed a lion roars. And when he cried-out, the seven thunders spoke their voices. ", "4": "And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u201cSeal the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them\u201d. ", "5": "And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted-up his right hand to heaven ", "6": "and swore by the One living forever and ever\u2014 Who created the heaven and the things in it, and the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it\u2014 that there will be no more time[d] [of delay].

But in your mouth it will be sweet like honey\u201d. ", "10": "And I took the little-scroll out of the hand of the angel, and I ate it up. And it was like sweet honey in my mouth. And when I ate it, my stomach was made-bitter. ", "11": "And they[g] say to me, \u201cYou must prophesy again for[h] many peoples and nations and tongues and kings\u201d."}

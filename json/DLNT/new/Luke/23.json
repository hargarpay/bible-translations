", "2": "And they began to accuse Him, saying \u201cWe found this One perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tributes[a] to Caesar, and saying that He is Christ, a King\u201d. ", "3": "And Pilate asked Him, saying \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d And the One, having responded to him, said \u201cYou are saying[b] it \u201d. ", "4": "And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, \u201cI find no guilt[c] in this man\u201d. ", "5": "But the ones were insisting[d], saying that \u201cHe is stirring-up the people, teaching throughout all Judea\u2014 having indeed begun from Galilee, as far as here\u201d. ", "6": "And Pilate, having heard it, asked if the man was a Galilean. ", "7": "And having learned that He was from the authority of Herod[e], he sent Him up to Herod\u2014 he also being in Jerusalem during these days.", "8": "Now Herod, having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly. For he was wanting to see Him for considerable periods-of-time because of hearing about Him. And he was hoping to see some sign being done by Him. ", "9": "And he was questioning Him with many words, but He answered him nothing. ", "10": "And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vigorously[f]. ", "11": "And Herod also\u2014 with his troops\u2014 having treated Him with contempt, and having mocked Him, having clothed Him with shining clothing, sent Him back to Pilate. ", "12": "Now both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on the very day. For they were-previously existing with hostility[g] toward them.", "13": "Now Pilate, having called-together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, ", "14": "said to them, \u201cYou brought me this man as One turning-away[h] the people. And behold\u2014 I, having examined Him in your presence, found no guilt in this man of the things which you are accusing against Him. ", "15": "But neither did Herod, for he sent Him back to us. And behold\u2014 nothing worthy of death has been committed by Him. ", "16": "Therefore, having disciplined Him, I will release Him\u201d.

I found no guilt worthy of death in Him. Therefore, having disciplined Him, I will release Him\u201d. ", "23": "But the ones were pressing-upon him with loud voices, asking that He be crucified. And their voices were prevailing. ", "24": "And Pilate decided[l] that their request should be done. ", "25": "And he released the one having been thrown into prison because of rebellion and murder, whom they were asking-for. And he handed-over Jesus to their will.", "26": "And when they led Him away, having taken-hold-of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian[m] coming from the country, they laid the cross on him to carry behind Jesus. ", "27": "And a large crowd of the people, and of women who were beating-their-breasts and lamenting Him, was following Him. ", "28": "But having turned to them, Jesus said, \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem, do not be weeping for Me. But weep for yourselves and for your children. ", "29": "Because behold\u2014 days are coming during which they will say, 'Blessed[n] are the barren, and[o] the wombs which did not bear and breasts which did not feed[p]'. ", "30": "At-that-time they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us', and to the hills, 'Cover us'.

", "33": "And when they came to the place being called \u201cThe Skull[t]\u201d, there they crucified Him and the criminals\u2014 one on the right side, and the other on the left side.

And they cast lots, dividing His garments among themselves.", "35": "And the people were standing there watching. And the rulers were also sneering-at Him, saying \u201cHe saved others. Let Him save Himself if this One is the Christ of God, the Chosen One\u201d.

", "40": "But having responded, the other, rebuking him, said \u201cDo you not even fear God? Because you are under the same condemnation[w]! ", "41": "And we are suffering justly, for we are receiving-back things worthy of the things which we did\u2014 but this One did nothing out-of-place[x]\u201d. ", "42": "And he was saying, \u201cJesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom\u201d. ", "43": "And He said to him, \u201cTruly I say to you, you will be with Me today in paradise\u201d.", "44": "And it was now about the sixth[y] hour.

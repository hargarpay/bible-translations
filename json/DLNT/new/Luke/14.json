{"1": "And it came about at His going into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were closely-watching Him. ", "2": "And behold\u2014 a certain man in front of Him was suffering-from-dropsy. ", "3": "And having responded, Jesus spoke to the Law-experts and Pharisees, saying, \u201cIs it lawful to cure on the Sabbath, or not?\u201d ", "4": "But the ones were quiet. And having taken-hold-of him, He healed him, and sent him away. ", "5": "And He said to them, \u201cWhose son or ox of yours will fall into a well, and he will not immediately pull him up on the day of the Sabbath?\u201d ", "6": "And they were not able to answer-back to these things.", "7": "And He was speaking a parable[a] to the ones having been invited, fixing-His-attention-on[b] how they were choosing the places-of-honor, saying to them\u2014 ", "8": "\u201cWhenever you are invited by someone to wedding-celebrations, do not lie down [to eat] in the place-of-honor lest a more distinguished one than you may have been invited by him, ", "9": "and having come, the one having invited you and him will say to you, 'Give your place to this one', and then you will begin to hold the last place with shame. ", "10": "But whenever you are invited, having gone, fall back [to eat] in the last place, so that when the one having invited you comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'. Then there will be glory for you in the presence of all the ones reclining back with you [to eat]. ", "11": "Because everyone exalting himself will be humbled. And the one humbling himself will be exalted\u201d.", "12": "And He was also saying to the one having invited Him, \u201cWhenever you make a morning-meal[c] or a dinner, do not be calling your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors\u2014 that they also might not perhaps invite you in return, and it become a repayment[d] to you. ", "13": "But whenever you make a reception, be inviting poor ones, crippled ones, lame ones, blind ones, ", "14": "and you will be blessed because they do not have the means to repay you. For it will be repaid to you at the resurrection of the righteous\u201d.", "15": "And one of the ones reclining back with Him [to eat], having heard these things, said to Him, \u201cBlessed is whoever will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d ", "16": "But the One said to him\u2014 \u201cA certain man was making a great dinner, and he invited many. ", "17": "And he sent-out his slave at the hour of the dinner to say to the ones having been invited, 'Come, because it is already prepared'. ", "18": "And they all alike began to excuse-themselves. The first said to him, 'I bought a field. And I have a necessity, having gone out, to see it. I ask you, have me excused'. ", "19": "And another said, 'I bought five pair[e] of oxen, and I am proceeding to test them. I ask you, have me excused'. ", "20": "And another said, 'I married a woman, and for this reason I am not able to come'. ", "21": "And having come, the slave reported these things to his master. Then, having become-angry[f], the house-master said to his slave, 'Go out quickly into the wide-roads[g] and lanes[h] of the city, and bring in here the poor ones and crippled ones and blind ones and lame ones'. ", "22": "And the slave said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and there is still room'. ", "23": "And the master said to the slave, 'Go out to the roads[i] and fences, and compel[j] them to come in, in order that my house may be filled. ", "24": "For I say to you[k] all that none of those men having been invited will taste my dinner'\u201d.", "25": "And large crowds were proceeding-with Him. And having turned, He said to them, ", "26": "\u201cIf anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and furthermore, even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.

", "31": "Or what king going to engage another king in battle will not, having sat-down first, deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet[m] the one coming against him with twenty thousand? ", "32": "Otherwise indeed, the one coming still being far away\u2014 the king, having sent-forth a delegation, asks the things for peace. ", "33": "So therefore, any of you who is not saying-goodbye[n] to all his possessions cannot be My disciple. ", "34": "Therefore, salt is good. But if indeed the salt should become-tasteless, with what will it be seasoned? ", "35": "It is fit neither for soil nor for the manure-pile. They throw it outside.

{"1": "Now concerning the foods-sacrificed-to-idols, we know that we all have knowledge[a]. Knowledge puffs-up, but love builds-up. ", "2": "If anyone thinks that he has come-to-know anything, he did not-yet know as he ought-to know. ", "3": "But if one loves[b] God, this one has been known by Him. ", "4": "Therefore concerning the eating of the foods-sacrificed-to-idols\u2014 we know that an idol is nothing[c] in the world, and that there is no God except one. ", "5": "For even if-indeed there are ones being called gods, whether in heaven or on earth\u2014 as-indeed there are many[d] gods and many lords\u2014 ", "6": "yet for us there is One God the Father, from Whom are all things, and we are[e] for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we are through Him. ", "7": "But this knowledge is not in all people. But some, by the accustomed-habit[f] of the idol until now, eat this food as[g] food-sacrificed-to-an-idol. And their conscience, being weak, is stained[h]. ", "8": "But food will not bring us[i] near[j] to God\u2014 neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat are we abounding. ", "9": "But be watching-out that this right[k] of yours does not somehow become an opportunity-for-stumbling to the weak ones. ", "10": "For if someone sees you, the one having knowledge, reclining [to eat] in an idol-temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be built-up so as to eat the foods-sacrificed-to-idols? ", "11": "For the one being weak is being destroyed[l] by your knowledge\u2014 the brother for the sake of whom Christ died! ", "12": "And in this manner sinning against the brothers and striking[m] their conscience while being weak, you are sinning against Christ.", "13": "For-this-very-reason, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meats, ever\u2014 in-order-that I may not cause my brother to fall."}

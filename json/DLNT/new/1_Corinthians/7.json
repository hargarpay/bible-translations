{"1": "Now concerning the things which you wrote\u2014 It is good[a] for a man not to touch[b] a woman. ", "2": "But because of sexual-immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. ", "3": "Let the husband give-back to his wife her due[c], and likewise also the wife to her husband. ", "4": "The wife does not have-authority[d] over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise also the husband does not have-authority over his own body, but the wife does. ", "5": "Do not be depriving one another\u2014 except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote-yourselves to prayer and [then] be together again\u2014 in order that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack-of-self-control. ", "6": "But I am saying this by way of concession, not by way of command. ", "7": "And I wish that all people were as[e] indeed myself! But each has his own gift from God\u2014 one in this manner and another in this manner. ", "8": "And I say to the unmarried and the widows\u2014 it is good for them if they remain as I also am. ", "9": "But if they do not have-self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burning[f].", "10": "But to the ones having married I command (not I, but the Lord), that a wife not be separated from her husband\u2014 ", "11": "but if indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried or let her be reconciled to her husband\u2014 and that a husband not leave[g] his wife.", "12": "But to the rest I say, not[h] the Lord\u2014 if any brother has an unbelieving wife and this one consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her. ", "13": "And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and this one consents to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. ", "14": "For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified[i] by his wife. And the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the brother. Otherwise then your children are unclean, but now[j] they are holy. ", "15": "But if the unbelieving one separates, let such a one separate. The brother or the sister has not been enslaved by such[k] things, but God has called you in peace. ", "16": "For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? ", "17": "Except that[l] as the Lord apportioned[m] to each one, as God has called each one, in this manner let him be walking. And thus I am directing[n] in all the churches.", "18": "Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not conceal[o] it. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. ", "19": "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. ", "20": "Each in the calling in which he was called\u2014 in this let him remain. ", "21": "Were you called as a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if also[p] you are able to become free, rather make-use-of the opportunity. ", "22": "For the one having been called in the Lord as a slave is a freedperson of the Lord. Likewise the one having been called as a free one is a slave of Christ. ", "23": "You were bought with a price; do not become slaves[q] of people. ", "24": "Each in what he was called, brothers\u2014 in this let him remain with God.", "25": "Now concerning virgins, I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one having been shown-mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy. ", "26": "I think then that this[r] is good because of the present necessity[s], that it is good for a person to be so[t]. ", "27": "Have you been bound[u] to a woman? Do not be seeking a release[v]. Have you been released[w] from a woman? Do not be seeking a wife. ", "28": "But even if you marry, you did not sin. And if the virgin marries, she did not sin. But such ones will have affliction in the flesh, and I am sparing[x] you.", "29": "And this I say, brothers\u2014 the time[y] is shortened, so that henceforth even the ones having wives should be as-though not having, ", "30": "and the ones weeping as-though not weeping, and the ones rejoicing as-though not rejoicing, and the ones buying as-though not holding-on-to[z], ", "31": "and the ones making-use-of the world as-though not making-full-use-of it. For the form[aa] of this world is passing away.", "32": "Now I want you to be free-from-concern. The unmarried man is concerned-about the things of the Lord\u2014 how he may please the Lord. ", "33": "But the man having married is concerned-about the things of the world\u2014 how he may please his wife, ", "34": "and he has been divided[ab]. And the unmarried woman[ac], and the virgin, is concerned-about the things of the Lord\u2014 that she may be holy both in the body and in the spirit. But the woman having married is concerned-about the things of the world\u2014 how she may please her husband.", "35": "Now I am saying this[ad] for the benefit of you yourselves\u2014 not that I may throw a noose[ae] on you, but toward good-order and devotion[af] to the Lord, undistractedly. ", "36": "But if one[ag] thinks that he is behaving-dishonorably[ah] toward his virgin daughter\u2014 if she is beyond-the-bloom-of-youth[ai], and it ought[aj] to be so\u2014 let him do what he wants. He is not sinning. Let them marry. ", "37": "But he who stands steadfast[ak] in his heart, not having a necessity[al], and has authority[am] concerning[an] his own will, and has determined this in his own heart, to keep[ao] his virgin daughter\u2014 he will do well[ap]. ", "38": "So then, both the one giving his virgin daughter in marriage is doing well, and the one not giving-in-marriage will do better.", "39": "A wife has been bound for as much time as her husband lives. But if her husband falls-asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes\u2014 only in the Lord. ", "40": "But she is happier if she remains thus[aq], according to my opinion; and I also think that I have the Spirit of God."}

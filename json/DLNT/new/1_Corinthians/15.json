{"1": "Now I make-known to you, brothers, the good-news which I announced-as-good-news to you, which you also received, in which you also stand, ", "2": "through which you also are being saved\u2014 if\u00a0[a] you are holding-on in that message I announced-as-good-news to you, unless[b] you believed in-vain. ", "3": "For I delivered to you among the first[c] things what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, ", "4": "and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, ", "5": "and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. ", "6": "After that He appeared to over five-hundred brothers at-one-time, of whom the majority are remaining until now. But some fell-asleep. ", "7": "After that He appeared to James, then to all the apostles. ", "8": "And last of all, as-if-indeed[d] to the untimely-born[e] one, He appeared to me also. ", "9": "For I am the least of the apostles\u2014 who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. ", "10": "But by the grace of God I am what I am. And His grace toward me did not become[f] empty[g]. But I labored even more than them all\u2014 yet not I, but the grace of God with me. ", "11": "So whether it was I or those, thus we are proclaiming, and thus you believed.", "12": "But if Christ is being proclaimed[h] that He has been raised from the dead, how is it some are saying among you that there is no resurrection of dead[i] ones?", "13": "Now if there is no resurrection of dead ones, neither has Christ been raised. ", "14": "And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is also empty; your faith is also empty; ", "15": "and we are even found to be false-witnesses of\u00a0[j] God, because we testified against[k] God that He did raise Christ\u2014 Whom He did not raise if-indeed then dead ones are not raised. ", "16": "For if dead ones are not raised, neither has Christ been raised. ", "17": "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile. You are still in your sins. ", "18": "Then also the ones having fallen-asleep in Christ perished[l]. ", "19": "If we are ones having hoped in Christ in this life only, we are more pitiable[m] than all people.", "20": "But now, Christ has been raised from the dead\u2014 the firstfruit[n] of the ones having fallen-asleep. ", "21": "For since death came through a man, the resurrection of dead ones also came through a man. ", "22": "For just as in[o] Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be given-life[p], ", "23": "but each in his own order[q]: Christ the firstfruit; after-that[r] the ones of\u00a0[s] Christ at His coming. ", "24": "Then[t] comes the end\u2014 when He hands-over the kingdom to His God and Father, when He[u] has abolished all[v] rule and all authority and power. ", "25": "For He[w] must reign until which time He[x] has put all the enemies under His feet. ", "26": "Death, the last enemy, is abolished[y]\u2014 ", "27": "for \u201cHe[z] subjected all things under His[aa] feet\u201d [Ps 8:6]. But when He says[ab] that \u201cAll things have been subjected\u201d, it is clear that this is except the One[ac] having subjected all things to Him. ", "28": "But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One[ad] having subjected all things to Him, in order that God may be all things in all.", "29": "Otherwise[ae], what will the ones being baptized for[af] the dead do? If dead ones are not raised at-all, why indeed are they baptized for them? ", "30": "Why indeed[ag] are we in danger every hour? ", "31": "I die[ah] daily\u2014 by[ai] your boasting, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. ", "32": "If in accordance with human[aj] thinking I fought-wild-animals[ak] at Ephesus, what is the profit to me? If dead ones are not raised, \u201cLet us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die\u201d [Isa 22:13].", "33": "Do not be deceived: bad companionships[al] corrupt good habits[am]. ", "34": "Sober-up[an] righteously[ao] and do not be[ap] sinning, for some have an ignorance of God. I speak to your shame.", "35": "But someone will say, \u201cHow are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?\u201d", "36": "Foolish one! What you sow is not given-life unless it dies. ", "37": "And as to what you sow\u2014 you do not sow the body which will come, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest. ", "38": "And God gives it a body just as He willed\u2014 indeed, to each of the seeds its own body[aq]. ", "39": "Not all flesh is the same flesh.

But the glory of the heavenly is one kind, and the glory of the earthly is different. ", "41": "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory.", "42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay[as]; it is raised in undecayability[at]. ", "43": "It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. ", "44": "It is sown a natural[au] body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is[av] a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. ", "45": "So also it has been written [in Gen 2:7], \u201cThe first man, Adam, became a living soul\u201d. The Last Adam[aw] became a life-giving[ax] spirit. ", "46": "But the spiritual body is not first\u2014 but the natural body, then the spiritual. ", "47": "The first man was from earth, made-of-dust. The second Man is from heaven[ay]. ", "48": "Such[az] as was the one made-of-dust\u2014 such ones also are the ones made-of-dust. And such as is the heavenly One\u2014 such ones also are the heavenly ones. ", "49": "And just as we bore[ba] the image[bb] of the one made of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly One.", "50": "Now I say this, brothers: that flesh and blood are not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor does decay inherit undecayability. ", "51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery[bc]: we will not all fall-asleep. But we will all be changed\u2014 ", "52": "in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For it will trumpet, and the dead will be raised undecayable[bd], and we will be changed. ", "53": "For this decayable body must put-on undecayability, and this mortal body must put on immortality[be]. ", "54": "And when this decayable body puts-on undecayability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying having been written will come-about[bf]: \u201cDeath was swallowed-up in victory\u201d [Isa 25:8]. ", "55": "\u201cDeath, where is your victory? Death, where is your stinger?\u201d [Hos 13:14]. ", "56": "Now the stinger[bg] of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law[bh]. ", "57": "But thanks be to God, the One giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.", "58": "So then my beloved brothers, be[bi] steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not empty[bj] in the Lord."}

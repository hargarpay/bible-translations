By this we know that we are in Him: ", "6": "the one claiming to be abiding in Him ought just as that One walked also himself thus to be walking.", "7": "Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old[d] commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard.

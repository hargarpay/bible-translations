", "4": "And Paul said, \u201cJohn baptized a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the One coming after him, that is, in Jesus\u201d. ", "5": "And having heard it, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. ", "6": "And Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they were speaking in tongues and prophesying.

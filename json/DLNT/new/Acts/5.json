And having brought a certain part of it, he laid it at the feet of the apostles. ", "3": "But Peter said, \u201cAnanias, for what reason did Satan fill your heart that you should lie-to the Holy Spirit and keep-back some of the proceeds of the land? ", "4": "While remaining unsold, was it not remaining yours? And having been sold, was it not within your authority? Why is it that you put this thing in your heart? You did not lie to people, but to God\u201d. ", "5": "And Ananias, hearing these words, having fallen-down, expired. And great fear came upon all the ones hearing it. ", "6": "And having arisen, the younger men wrapped him up. And having carried him out, they buried him.

And they will carry you out\u201d. ", "10": "And she fell at-once at his feet, and expired. And having come in, the young-men found her dead. And having carried her out, they buried her with her husband.

But having opened, we found no one inside\u201d.

And the high priest questioned them, ", "28": "saying, \u201cDid we not command you with a command not to be teaching on the basis of this name? And behold\u2014 you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching. And you intend[k] to bring the blood of this man upon us\u201d.

{"1": "And Saul was giving-approval to his killing. And a great persecution came about on that day against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all dispersed[a] throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. ", "2": "And reverent men carried-in Stephen [for burial], and made a loud lamentation over him. ", "3": "And Saul was destroying[b] the church. Entering from house to house, dragging-away both men and women, he was handing them over to prison. ", "4": "So indeed, the ones having been dispersed went about announcing the word as good news.", "5": "Now Philip, having gone down to the city[c] of Samaria, was proclaiming the Christ to them. ", "6": "And the crowds were with-one-accord paying-attention-to[d] the things being said by Philip, during their hearing and seeing the signs which he was doing. ", "7": "For many of the ones having unclean spirits\u2014 they were coming out while shouting with a loud voice. And many paralyzed ones and lame ones were cured. ", "8": "And there was great joy in that city. ", "9": "Now a certain man, Simon by name, was-previously in the city practicing-magic and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying that he was someone great, ", "10": "to whom they all, from the small up to the great, were paying attention, saying, \u201cThis one is the Power[e] of God being called 'Great'\u201d. ", "11": "And they were paying attention to him because he had astonished them for a considerable time with the magic-arts. ", "12": "And when they believed Philip announcing-the-good-news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized\u2014 both men and women.

And he was reading the prophet Isaiah. ", "29": "And the Spirit said to Philip, \u201cApproach and join this chariot\u201d. ", "30": "And having run up, Philip heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, \u201cDo you indeed understand the things which you are reading?\u201d ", "31": "And the one said, \u201cHow indeed might I be able, unless someone will guide me?\u201d And he invited Philip to sit with him, having come up.", "32": "Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: \u201cHe was led like a sheep to slaughter.

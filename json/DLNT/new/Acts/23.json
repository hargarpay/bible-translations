{"1": "And Paul, having looked-intently at the Sanhedrin, said, \u201cMen, brothers, I have conducted-myself\u00a0[a] with all good conscience before God up to this day\u201d. ", "2": "And the high priest Ananias[b] commanded the ones standing near him to strike his mouth. ", "3": "Then Paul said to him, \u201cGod is going to strike you\u2014 whitewashed wall! Do You indeed sit there judging me according to the Law, and violating-the-Law, order that I be struck?\u201d ", "4": "And the ones standing near said, \u201cAre you reviling the high priest of God?\u201d ", "5": "And Paul said, \u201cI did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it has been written [in Ex 22:28] that 'You shall not speak badly of a ruler of your people'\u201d.", "6": "And Paul, having known that the one part of them was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, was crying-out in the Sanhedrin, \u201cMen, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being judged concerning the hope[c] and resurrection of the dead\u201d. ", "7": "And he having said this, a dispute between the Pharisees and Sadducees took place, and the assembly was divided. ", "8": "For Sadducees say that there is not a resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit\u2014 but Pharisees confess all[d] three. ", "9": "And a great clamor took place. And having stood up, some of the scribes of the Pharisees' part were battling, saying, \u201cWe are finding no evil in this man. And what if a spirit did speak to him, or an angel?\u201d", "10": "And while a great dispute was taking place, the commander\u2014 having feared that Paul might be torn-to-pieces by them\u2014 ordered the troop[e], having gone down, to snatch him out of the midst of them and bring him to the barracks.", "11": "And on the following[f] night, the Lord, having stood near him, said, \u201cTake-courage. For as you solemnly-testified in Jerusalem as to the things concerning Me, so you must also testify in Rome\u201d.", "12": "And having become day, the Jews, having held a gathering, bound themselves under-a-curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until which time they killed Paul. ", "13": "Now there were more than forty having made[g] this sworn-pact\u2014 ", "14": "who, having gone to the chief priests and the elders, said, \u201cWith a curse[h], we bound ourselves under-a-curse to eat nothing until which time we kill Paul. ", "15": "Now therefore, you, along with the Sanhedrin, notify the commander so that he may bring him down to you, as-though you are intending to determine the things concerning him more accurately. And we are prepared that we might kill him before he draws-near\u201d.", "16": "But the son of the sister of Paul\u2014 having heard-of the ambush, having come and entered into the barracks\u2014 reported it to Paul. ", "17": "And Paul, having summoned one of the centurions, said, \u201cLead this young-man away to the commander, for he has something to report to him\u201d. ", "18": "So indeed the one, having taken him along, led him to the commander. And he says, \u201cPaul the prisoner, having summoned me, asked that I lead this young man to you\u2014 he having something to tell you\u201d. ", "19": "And the commander\u2014 having taken-hold-of his hand, and having withdrawn privately\u2014 was asking, \u201cWhat is it that you have to report to me?\u201d ", "20": "And he said that \u201cThe Jews agreed to ask you so that tomorrow you might bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin, as-though intending to inquire something more accurately concerning him. ", "21": "So don't you be persuaded by them. For more than forty men from-among them are lying-in-wait-for him who bound themselves under-a-curse neither to eat nor drink until which time they kill him. And now they are prepared, waiting-for the promise[i] from you\u201d.", "22": "Then indeed the commander sent away the young-man, having commanded him to tell no one \u201cthat you revealed[j] these things to me\u201d. ", "23": "And having summoned a certain two of the centurions, he said, \u201cPrepare two-hundred soldiers and seventy horsemen and two-hundred spearmen[k] so that they may proceed to Caesarea at the third[l] hour of the night\u201d; ", "24": "and that they should provide mounts in order that having put-on Paul, they might bring him safely through to Felix[m] the governor, ", "25": "he having written a letter having this form:", "26": "\u201cClaudius Lysias, to the most-excellent governor Felix: Greetings. ", "27": "I rescued this man having been seized by the Jews and being about to be killed by them, having come-suddenly-upon them with the troop\u2014 having learned that he was a Roman[n]. ", "28": "And wanting to know the reason for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin\u2014 ", "29": "whom I found being accused about issues of their Law, but having no accusation[o] worthy of death or imprisonment. ", "30": "And a plot having been disclosed to me that would be against the man, I sent him to you at once, having also ordered his accusers to speak the things against him before you\u201d.", "31": "So indeed the soldiers, in accordance with the thing having been commanded them, having picked-up Paul, brought him during the night to Antipatris. ", "32": "And on the next day, they[p] returned to the barracks, having let the horsemen depart with him\u2014 ", "33": "who, having entered into Caesarea, and having delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul to him also. ", "34": "And having read it, and having asked from what province he was, and having learned that he was from Cilicia, ", "35": "he said, \u201cI will give you a hearing whenever your accusers also arrive\u201d\u2014 having ordered that he be guarded in the Praetorium[q] of Herod."}

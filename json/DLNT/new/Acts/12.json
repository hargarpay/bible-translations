", "3": "And having seen that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also (now the days of the Feast of Unleavened-Bread were taking place)\u2014 ", "4": "whom indeed having seized, he put into prison, having handed him over to four squads[c] of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him up to the people after the Passover [Feast]. ", "5": "So indeed Peter was being kept in the prison. And prayer was fervently being made by the church to God for him.", "6": "And when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains. And guards in front of the door were keeping-watch-over the prison. ", "7": "And behold\u2014 an angel of the Lord stood near, and light[d] shined in the cell. And having struck the side of Peter, he woke him, saying, \u201cArise quickly\u201d. And his chains fell off of his hands. ", "8": "And the angel said to him, \u201cGird-yourself [e] and tie-on your sandals\u201d. And he did so. And he says to him, \u201cPut-on your cloak and be following me\u201d. ", "9": "And having gone forth, he was following. And he did not know that the thing taking place by-means-of the angel was real, but he was thinking that he was seeing a vision. ", "10": "And having gone through a first guard-post[f] and a second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which by-itself was opened for them.

", "12": "And having become-aware[i], he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John (the one being called Mark), where there were many assembled-together and praying. ", "13": "And he having knocked-on the door of the gate, a servant-girl went to it to answer\u2014 Rhoda by name.

", "15": "But the ones said to her, \u201cYou are mad[j]\u201d. But the one was insisting that it was holding so. But the ones were saying, \u201cIt is his angel\u201d.

", "3": "And they put their hands on them, and put them in jail[b] until the next day. For it was already evening. ", "4": "But many of the ones having heard the word believed. And the number of the men became about five thousand.", "5": "And it came about on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem\u2014 ", "6": "and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. ", "7": "And having stood them in the middle, they were inquiring, \u201cBy what power or by what name did you do this?\u201d ", "8": "Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, \u201cRulers of the people, and elders: ", "9": "If we are being examined today for a good-deed to a weak[c] man, by what means[d] this one has been restored, ", "10": "let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene\u2014 Whom you crucified, Whom God raised from the dead\u2014 by this One[e] this one stands before you healthy.

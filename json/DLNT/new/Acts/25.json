And they were appealing-to him, ", "3": "asking-for a favor against him, so that he might summon him to Jerusalem\u2014 while making an ambush to kill him along the way. ", "4": "Then indeed Festus responded that Paul was being kept in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to be proceeding-out [of Jerusalem] shortly. ", "5": "\u201cSo\u201d, he says, \u201cthe powerful ones among you having gone-down-with me\u2014 if there is something out-of-place in the man, let them be accusing him there\u201d. ", "6": "And having spent days among them (not more than eight or ten), having come down to Caesarea, having sat on the judgment-seat on the next day, he ordered that Paul be brought.", "7": "And he having arrived, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood around him bringing many and weighty charges against him, which they were not able to prove\u2014 ", "8": "Paul speaking-in-defense that \u201cNeither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, did I sin anything\u201d.

I did the Jews no wrong, as you also are knowing very well. ", "11": "So if I am doing wrong[a] and have committed something worthy of death, I am not refusing to die. But if the things of which these ones are accusing me are nothing, no one is able[b] to freely-give me to them. I appeal-to Caesar[c]\u201d.

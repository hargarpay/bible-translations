", "2": "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago\u2014 whether in the body, I do not know, or outside of the body, I do not know. God knows\u2014 that such a one was snatched-away[b] to the third heaven. ", "3": "And I know such a man\u2014 whether in the body or apart from the body, I do not know. God knows\u2014 ", "4": "that he was snatched away into paradise, and heard unspeakable words which are not permitted for a man to speak. ", "5": "I will boast on behalf of such a one. But I will not boast on behalf of myself, except in the weaknesses. ", "6": "For if I should desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I am sparing you, that no one might credit to me beyond what he sees as to me, or hears as to something from me.", "7": "And[c] for the excess[d] of the revelations\u2014 for-this-reason, in order that I might not be exalted[e], a thorn in the flesh was given to me; a messenger of Satan to[f] beat[g] me in order that I might not be exalted.

For My power is perfected[j] in weakness\u201d. Therefore most-gladly[k] I will rather boast in my weaknesses in order that the power of Christ may dwell upon me. ", "10": "For this reason I am well-pleased with weaknesses, with insults[l], with constraints, with persecutions and distresses for the sake of Christ. For whenever I am weak, at that time I am powerful[m].", "11": "I have become foolish\u2014 you compelled me! For I ought to be being commended by you! For I in no way came-short-of the superlative[n] apostles, even though I am nothing; ", "12": "the signs[o] of the apostle were produced among you in[p] all endurance in both signs and wonders, and miracles.", "13": "For what is it as to which you were worse-off\u00a0[q] than the other churches?\u2014 except that I myself did not burden[r] you. Forgive me this wrong-doing! ", "14": "Behold\u2014 this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden. For I am not seeking your things, but you.

Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same footsteps?", "19": "All-this-time are you thinking[u] that we are defending-ourselves to you?

{"1": "O foolish Galatians, who bewitched[a] you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was portrayed[b] as crucified? ", "2": "I want to learn only this from you: did you receive the Spirit by works of the Law or by the hearing[c] of\u00a0[d] faith? ", "3": "Are you so foolish? Having begun-with[e] the Spirit are you now perfecting-yourselves[f] with the flesh? ", "4": "Did you suffer[g] so many things in-vain\u2014 if indeed it really was in-vain? ", "5": "Did then the One supplying[h] you the Spirit and working miracles among you do it because-of\u00a0[i] works of the Law, or because-of the hearing of faith?", "6": "Just as Abraham \u201c believed God and it was credited to him for righteousness\u201d [Gen 15:6], ", "7": "know then that the ones of\u00a0[j] faith\u2014 these are the sons[k] of Abraham. ", "8": "Now the Scripture, having foreseen that God declares the Gentiles righteous by faith, announced-the-good-news-beforehand to Abraham: that \u201cAll the Gentiles will be blessed in[l] you\u201d[Gen 12:3]. ", "9": "So then the ones of faith are being blessed together-with Abraham, the man-of-faith[m]. ", "10": "For all-who are of the works of the Law are under a curse, for it has been written that \u201cCursed is everyone who is not continuing-in[n] all the things having been written in the book of the Law, that he might do them\u201d[Deut 27:26]. ", "11": "And that no one is declared-righteous by[o] the Law before God is evident[p], because \u201cThe righteous one will live by faith\u201d [Hab 2:4]. ", "12": "But the Law is not of faith, but \u201cThe one having done these things shall live by them\u201d [Lev 18:5]. ", "13": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us\u2014 because it has been written, \u201cCursed is everyone hanging on a tree\u201d [Deut 21:23]\u2014 ", "14": "in order that the blessing of\u00a0[q] Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, in order that we might receive the promise of\u00a0[r] the Spirit through faith.", "15": "Brothers, I speak in accordance with human thinking: Though it is [a covenant] of a human, no one sets-aside or adds-conditions-to a covenant having been ratified. ", "16": "Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed[s]. He[t] does not say [in Gen 13:15] \u201cand to seeds\u201d, as-though speaking in reference to many; but as-though speaking in reference to one, \u201cand to your seed\u201d\u2014 who is Christ. ", "17": "And this I say: the Law, having come-about after four-hundred and thirty years, does not un-ratify[u] the covenant having been previously-ratified by God, so as to do-away-with[v] the promise. ", "18": "For if the inheritance is of\u00a0[w] the Law, it is no longer of the promise. But God has freely-given it to Abraham through the promise!", "19": "Why then the Law? It was added because of the transgressions until which time the Seed should come to Whom the promise has been made, having been commanded[x] through angels by the hand of a mediator[y]. ", "20": "Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of [only] one [party], but God is one[z].", "21": "Is the Law then against the promises of God? May it never be! For if a Law being able to give-life had been given, righteousness really would have been by the Law! ", "22": "But the Scripture confined all things under[aa] sin, in order that the promise by faith[ab] in Jesus Christ might be given to the ones believing. ", "23": "And before the faith[ac] came, we were being kept-in-custody[ad] under the Law\u2014 being confined until[ae] the faith destined to be revealed. ", "24": "So then the Law has been[af] our tutor[ag] leading-to[ah] Christ, in order that we might be declared-righteous by faith. ", "25": "But the faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor! ", "26": "For you all are sons[ai] of God through faith in Christ Jesus! ", "27": "For all you who were baptized into Christ put-on[aj] Christ. ", "28": "There is no Jew nor Greek, there is no slave nor free, there is no male and female. For you all are one in Christ Jesus. ", "29": "And if you are Christ's, then you are seed of Abraham\u2014 heirs according-to the promise."}

{"1": "Therefore, having been declared-righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, ", "2": "through Whom also we have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we are boasting over the hope of the glory of God. ", "3": "And not only this, but we also are boasting in the afflictions\u2014 knowing that the affliction is producing endurance, ", "4": "and the endurance is producing approvedness, and the approvedness is producing hope, ", "5": "and the hope does not put-to-shame[a] because the love of God has been poured-out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit having been given to us.", "6": "For while we were still being weak, yet at the right-time, Christ died for ungodly ones. ", "7": "For one will rarely[b] die for a righteous person; for[c] perhaps someone may even dare to die for the good person. ", "8": "But God demonstrates[d] His own love for us because while we were still being sinners, Christ died for us. ", "9": "Therefore by much more, having now been declared-righteous by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath through Him.

But where sin increased, grace super-abounded, ", "21": "in order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness, resulting-in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."}

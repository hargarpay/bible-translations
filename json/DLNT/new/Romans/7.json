{"1": "Or[a] do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to ones knowing the Law[b]), that the Law lords-over[c] the person for as much time as he lives? ", "2": "For the married woman has been bound by the Law to the living husband; but if the husband dies, she has been released from the law of\u00a0[d] the husband. ", "3": "So then, while the husband is living, she will be called an adulteress if she comes[e] to a different husband. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, having come to a different husband.", "4": "So-then[f], my brothers, you also were put-to-death with reference to the Law[g] through the body of Christ so that you might come[h] to a different One\u2014 to the One having arisen from the dead\u2014 in order that we might bear-fruit for God.", "5": "For when we were in the flesh[i], the passions of\u00a0[j] sins which[k] were through[l] the Law were at-work in our body-parts so as to bear-fruit for death. ", "6": "But now we were released[m] from the Law, having died to that by which we were being held, so that we are serving in newness of the Spirit[n] and not in oldness of the letter[o].", "7": "Therefore, what shall we say? Is the Law sin[p]? May it never be! On-the-contrary, I would not have known[q] sin except through the Law. For indeed I would not have known[r] coveting[s] if the Law were not saying [in Ex 20:17], \u201cYou shall not covet\u201d. ", "8": "But sin, having taken[t] an opportunity[u] through the commandment, produced[v] every[w] [kind of ] coveting in me. For apart-from[x] the Law, sin is dead[y].", "9": "And I was once[z] alive apart from the Law. But the commandment having come, sin became-alive[aa] ", "10": "and I died. And the commandment for[ab] life\u2014 this was found in me to be for[ac] death. ", "11": "For sin, having taken an opportunity through the commandment, deceived[ad] me, and through it, killed me.", "12": "So-then the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.", "13": "Therefore did the good thing become death[ae] for me? May it never be! On the contrary, it was sin, in order that it might become-visible as sin while producing death in me through the good thing, in order that sin might become extremely[af] sinful through the commandment.", "14": "For[ag] we know that the Law is spiritual. But I am made-of-flesh[ah], having been sold under sin. ", "15": "For I do not understand[ai] what[aj] I am producing. For I am not practicing this which I am wanting, but I am doing this which I am hating. ", "16": "But if I am doing this which I am not wanting, I am agreeing-with[ak] the Law\u2014 that it is good. ", "17": "And now I am no longer producing it, but the sin[al] dwelling in me is.", "18": "For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. For the wanting is present in me, but the producing the good is not. ", "19": "For I am not doing the good which I am wanting, but I am practicing this evil which I am not wanting. ", "20": "But if I am doing this which I am not wanting, I am no longer producing it, but the sin[am] dwelling in me is.", "21": "I find then the law[an] in me, the one wanting to do the good, that the evil is present in me. ", "22": "For I am rejoicing-with[ao] the Law of God according-to[ap] the inner person. ", "23": "But I am seeing a different law in my body-parts waging-war-against[aq] the law of my mind, and taking me captive[ar] under the law of sin existing in my body-parts. ", "24": "I am a wretched[as] person! Who will deliver me from this[at] body of\u00a0[au] death? ", "25": "But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself am serving the Law of God with the mind, but the law of sin with the flesh."}

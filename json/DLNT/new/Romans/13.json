And the ones having resisted will receive[f] judgment on themselves.", "3": "For the rulers are not a fear to good work, but to evil[g]. Now do you want to not be fearing the authority? Be doing good, and you will have praise[h] from him[i]\u2014 ", "4": "for he is God's servant to you for good. But if you are doing evil, be fearing! For he does not bear[j] the sword in-vain[k]\u2014 for he is God's servant, an avenger for wrath on the one practicing evil.

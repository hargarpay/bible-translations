{"1": "Now indeed, the first covenant also had regulations of service and the earthly Holy Place. ", "2": "For the first[a] tabernacle was prepared[b]\u2014 in which were both the lampstand and the table, and the Presentation of the bread\u2014 which is called the Holies. ", "3": "And behind the second curtain was the tabernacle being called the Holies of Holies, ", "4": "having a golden altar-of-incense[c], and the ark[d] of the covenant having been covered on-all-sides with gold, in which was a golden jar having the manna and the rod of Aaron having budded and the tablets of the covenant, ", "5": "and above it were the cherubim[e] of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat[f]\u2014 concerning which things there is not time now to be speaking in detail. ", "6": "And these things thus having been prepared, the priests accomplishing the services are continually going into the first tabernacle. ", "7": "But into the second only the high priest goes once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and the ignorances[g] of the people\u2014", "8": "... the Holy Spirit making this clear: that the way of\u00a0[h] the Holies has not yet been made-known while the first tabernacle[i] was[j] still having[k] a standing, ", "9": "which[l] is[m] a symbol for the present[n] time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered not being able to perfect the one worshiping in relation to the conscience, ", "10": "being[o] only (in-addition-to foods and drinks and different cleansings[p]) regulations of\u00a0[q] flesh being imposed until the time of reformation.", "11": "But Christ, having arrived[r] as High Priest of the good things having come, entered[s] once-for-all into the Holies through[t] the greater and more-perfect tabernacle not made-by-human-hands\u2014 that is, not of this creation; ", "12": "and not through[u] the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, having obtained[v] eternal redemption.", "13": "For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the ones having been defiled sanctifies for the cleansing of the flesh, ", "14": "by how much more will the blood of Christ, Who through the eternal Spirit[w] offered Himself without-blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works so that we may worship[x] the living God!", "15": "And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that the ones having been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance\u2014 a death having taken-place for the redemption from the transgressions committed under[y] the first covenant.

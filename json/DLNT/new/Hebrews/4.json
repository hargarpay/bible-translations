But the word[d] of hearing did not profit those ones, they[e] not having been united in faith with the ones[f] having heard. ", "3": "For we, the ones having believed[g], enter into the rest, just as He has said: \u201cAs I swore in My wrath, they shall never enter into My rest\u201d [Ps 95:11]. And-yet, His works have been done since the foundation of the world. ", "4": "For He has spoken somewhere about the seventh day as follows: \u201cAnd God rested on the seventh day from all His works\u201d [Gen 2:2], ", "5": "and in this [Ps 95:11] again: \u201cThey shall never enter into My rest\u201d.", "6": "Since then it remains that some may enter into it, and the ones formerly having had-good-news-announced to them did not enter because of disobedience, ", "7": "He again designates a certain day\u2014 \u201cToday\u201d\u2014 saying by[h] David after so much time just as it has been said-before: \u201cToday, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts\u201d [Ps 95:7-8].

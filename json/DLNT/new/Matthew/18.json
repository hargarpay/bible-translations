", "4": "Therefore whoever will humble himself like this child, this one is the greater one in the kingdom of the heavens.", "5": "\u201cAnd whoever welcomes[f] one such[g] child on the basis of My name, welcomes Me. ", "6": "But whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to fall\u2014 it would be better[h] for him that a donkey's millstone[i] be hung around his neck and he be sunk in the deep-part[j] of the sea.", "7": "\u201cWoe to the world because of the causes-of-falling. For it is a necessity that causes-of-falling should come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause-of-falling comes.

It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet.

If a hundred sheep belong to any man and one of them went-astray, will he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains, and having gone, be seeking the one going astray? ", "13": "And if it comes about that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine not having gone astray.

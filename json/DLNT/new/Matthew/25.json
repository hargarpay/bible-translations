{"1": "\u201cAt-that-time[a], the kingdom of the heavens will be-like ten virgins, who, having taken their lamps[b], went out to meet the bridegroom. ", "2": "Now five of them were foolish, and five were wise. ", "3": "For the foolish ones, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them. ", "4": "But the wise ones took oil in jars with their lamps. ", "5": "And while the bridegroom was delaying, they all became drowsy and were sleeping. ", "6": "And in the middle of the night, a shout has come\u2014 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' ", "7": "Then all those virgins arose and put their lamps in-order. ", "8": "And the foolish ones said to the wise ones, 'Give us from your oil, because our lamps are going-out[c]'. ", "9": "But the wise ones responded, saying, 'There will not by any means ever[d] be enough for us and for you. Go instead to the ones selling and buy for yourselves'. ", "10": "And while they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came. And the prepared ones entered with him into the wedding-celebrations. And the door was shut. ", "11": "And later, the other virgins also come, saying, 'Sir, sir, open for us'. ", "12": "But the one, having responded, said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know[e] you'. ", "13": "Therefore, keep-watching, because you do not know the day nor the hour.", "14": "\u201cFor it\u00a0[f] is just like a man going-on-a-journey\u2014 he called his own slaves and handed over his possessions to them. ", "15": "And he gave five talents[g] to one, and two to another, and one to another\u2014 to each according to his own ability. And he went on his journey. ", "16": "Immediately[h] having gone, the one having received the five talents worked with them and gained another five. ", "17": "Similarly, the one having received the two talents gained another two. ", "18": "But the one having received the one talent, having gone, dug [a hole in] the ground and hid his master's silver talent. ", "19": "Now after much time, the master of those slaves comes and settles the account with them. ", "20": "And having come to him, the one having received the five talents brought another five talents, saying, 'Master, you handed-over five talents to me. Look, I gained another five talents'. ", "21": "His master said to him, 'Well[i] done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master'. ", "22": "And also having come to him, the one having received the two talents said, 'Master, you handed over two talents to me. Look, I gained another two talents'. ", "23": "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master'. ", "24": "And also having come to him, the one having received[j] the one talent said, 'Master, I knew you\u2014 that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter[k] [threshings]. ", "25": "And having become afraid, having gone, I hid your talent in the ground. Look, you have what is yours'. ", "26": "But having responded, his master said to him, 'Evil and lazy slave! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter[l]! ", "27": "Therefore you should-have put my money with the bankers. And having come, I would have received-back what was mine with interest. ", "28": "Therefore take the talent away from him, and give it to the one having the ten talents. ", "29": "For to everyone having, it will be given, and he will be caused-to-abound. But from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away from him.

And He will separate them[p] from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. ", "33": "And He will make the sheep stand[q] on His right side, and the goats on the left side. ", "34": "Then the King will say to the ones on His right side, 'Come, the ones having been blessed of [r] My Father\u2014 inherit the kingdom having been prepared for you since the foundation of the world.

", "42": "For I was hungry, and you did not give Me something to eat. I thirsted, and you did not give-a-drink-to Me. ", "43": "I was a stranger, and you did not bring Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not look after Me'. ", "44": "Then they also will respond, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and we did not serve You?'

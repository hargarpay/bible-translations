You[b] know-how to discern the appearance of the heaven but cannot discern the signs of the times! ", "4": "An evil and adulterous[c] generation is seeking-for a sign. And a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah\u201d. And having left them behind, He went away. ", "5": "And the disciples, having come to the other side, forgot to take bread.

Do you not-even[e] remember the five loaves of the five-thousand, and how many baskets you received? ", "10": "Not even the seven loaves of the four-thousand, and how many large-baskets you received? ", "11": "How is it you do not perceive that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees\u201d. ", "12": "Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.", "13": "And Jesus, having come into the regions of Philip's[f] Caesarea, was asking His disciples, saying, \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d ", "14": "And the ones said, \u201cSome, John the Baptist. And others, Elijah. And different ones, Jeremiah or one of the prophets\u201d.

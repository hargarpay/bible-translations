{"1": "My brothers and sisters,[a] do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ?[b] ", "2": "For if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in, ", "3": "and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say, \u201cHave a seat here, please,\u201d while to the one who is poor you say, \u201cStand there,\u201d or, \u201cSit at my feet,\u201d[c] ", "4": "have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? ", "5": "Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters.[d] Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him? ", "6": "But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court? ", "7": "Is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you?", "8": "You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d ", "9": "But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. ", "10": "For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it. ", "11": "For the one who said, \u201cYou shall not commit adultery,\u201d also said, \u201cYou shall not murder.\u201d Now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. ", "12": "So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty. ", "13": "For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.", "14": "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,[e] if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you?

", "17": "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.", "18": "But someone will say, \u201cYou have faith and I have works.\u201d Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith. ", "19": "You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe\u2014and shudder. ", "20": "Do you want to be shown, you senseless person, that faith apart from works is barren? ", "21": "Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? ", "22": "You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was brought to completion by the works. ", "23": "Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says, \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,\u201d and he was called the friend of God. ", "24": "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. ", "25": "Likewise, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road? ", "26": "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead."}

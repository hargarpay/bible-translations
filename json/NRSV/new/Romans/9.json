For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel, ", "7": "and not all of Abraham's children are his true descendants; but \u201cIt is through Isaac that descendants shall be named for you.\u201d ", "8": "This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants. ", "9": "For this is what the promise said, \u201cAbout this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.\u201d ", "10": "Nor is that all; something similar happened to Rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband, our ancestor Isaac.

{"1": "I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. ", "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? ", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.\u201d ", "4": "But what is the divine reply to him? \u201cI have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\u201d ", "5": "So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. ", "6": "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.[a]", "7": "What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, ", "8": "as it is written, \u201cGod gave them a sluggish spirit, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.\u201d", "9": "And David says, \u201cLet their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;", "10": "let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and keep their backs forever bent.\u201d", "11": "So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling[b] salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel[c] jealous. ", "12": "Now if their stumbling[d] means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!", "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry ", "14": "in order to make my own people[e] jealous, and thus save some of them. ", "15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead!

", "19": "You will say, \u201cBranches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u201d ", "20": "That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. ", "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.[g] ", "22": "Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. ", "23": "And even those of Israel,[h] if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. ", "24": "For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.", "25": "So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters,[i] I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.

How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!", "34": "\u201cFor who has known the mind of the Lord?

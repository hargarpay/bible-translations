", "3": "He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. ", "4": "When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \u201cPut out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d ", "5": "Simon answered, \u201cMaster, we have worked all night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down the nets.\u201d ", "6": "When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break. ", "7": "So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. ", "8": "But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, \u201cGo away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!\u201d ", "9": "For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken; ", "10": "and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, \u201cDo not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.\u201d ", "11": "When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.", "12": "Once, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man covered with leprosy.[b] When he saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him, \u201cLord, if you choose, you can make me clean.\u201d ", "13": "Then Jesus[c] stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, \u201cI do choose.

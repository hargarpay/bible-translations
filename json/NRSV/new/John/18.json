{"1": "After Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. ", "2": "Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. ", "3": "So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. ", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, \u201cWhom are you looking for?\u201d ", "5": "They answered, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d[a] Jesus replied, \u201cI am he.\u201d[b] Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. ", "6": "When Jesus[c] said to them, \u201cI am he,\u201d[d] they stepped back and fell to the ground. ", "7": "Again he asked them, \u201cWhom are you looking for?\u201d And they said, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d[e] ", "8": "Jesus answered, \u201cI told you that I am he.[f] So if you are looking for me, let these men go.\u201d ", "9": "This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, \u201cI did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.\u201d ", "10": "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus. ", "11": "Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?\u201d", "12": "So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him. ", "13": "First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. ", "14": "Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.", "15": "Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, ", "16": "but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. ", "17": "The woman said to Peter, \u201cYou are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?\u201d He said, \u201cI am not.\u201d ", "18": "Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.", "19": "Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. ", "20": "Jesus answered, \u201cI have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. ", "21": "Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.\u201d ", "22": "When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, \u201cIs that how you answer the high priest?\u201d ", "23": "Jesus answered, \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\u201d ", "24": "Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, \u201cYou are not also one of his disciples, are you?\u201d He denied it and said, \u201cI am not.\u201d ", "26": "One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, \u201cDid I not see you in the garden with him?\u201d ", "27": "Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.", "28": "Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate's headquarters.[g] It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters,[h] so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. ", "29": "So Pilate went out to them and said, \u201cWhat accusation do you bring against this man?\u201d ", "30": "They answered, \u201cIf this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.\u201d ", "31": "Pilate said to them, \u201cTake him yourselves and judge him according to your law.\u201d The Jews replied, \u201cWe are not permitted to put anyone to death.\u201d ", "32": "(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)", "33": "Then Pilate entered the headquarters[i] again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d ", "34": "Jesus answered, \u201cDo you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?\u201d ", "35": "Pilate replied, \u201cI am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?\u201d ", "36": "Jesus answered, \u201cMy kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.\u201d ", "37": "Pilate asked him, \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d ", "38": "Pilate asked him, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, \u201cI find no case against him. ", "39": "But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d ", "40": "They shouted in reply, \u201cNot this man, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a bandit."}

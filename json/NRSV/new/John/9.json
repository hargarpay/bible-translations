", "2": "His disciples asked him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\u201d ", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God's works might be revealed in him. ", "4": "We[a] must work the works of him who sent me[b] while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. ", "5": "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u201d ", "6": "When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man's eyes, ", "7": "saying to him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. ", "8": "The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, \u201cIs this not the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d ", "9": "Some were saying, \u201cIt is he.\u201d Others were saying, \u201cNo, but it is someone like him.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cI am the man.\u201d ", "10": "But they kept asking him, \u201cThen how were your eyes opened?\u201d ", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' Then I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d ", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said, \u201cI do not know.\u201d", "13": "They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.

He said to them, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.\u201d ", "16": "Some of the Pharisees said, \u201cThis man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.\u201d But others said, \u201cHow can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?\u201d And they were divided. ", "17": "So they said again to the blind man, \u201cWhat do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\u201d He said, \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d", "18": "The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight ", "19": "and asked them, \u201cIs this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\u201d ", "20": "His parents answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; ", "21": "but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.\u201d ", "22": "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus[c] to be the Messiah[d] would be put out of the synagogue.

One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.\u201d ", "26": "They said to him, \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ", "27": "He answered them, \u201cI have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u201d ", "28": "Then they reviled him, saying, \u201cYou are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. ", "29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.\u201d ", "30": "The man answered, \u201cHere is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. ", "31": "We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will.

", "33": "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\u201d ", "34": "They answered him, \u201cYou were born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?\u201d And they drove him out.", "35": "Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d[e] ", "36": "He answered, \u201cAnd who is he, sir?[f] Tell me, so that I may believe in him.\u201d ", "37": "Jesus said to him, \u201cYou have seen him, and the one speaking with you is he.\u201d ", "38": "He said, \u201cLord,[g] I believe.\u201d And he worshiped him. ", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cI came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.\u201d ", "40": "Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, \u201cSurely we are not blind, are we?\u201d ", "41": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."}

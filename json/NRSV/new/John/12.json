{"1": "Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. ", "2": "There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. ", "3": "Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus' feet, and wiped them[a] with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. ", "4": "But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, ", "5": "\u201cWhy was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii[b] and the money given to the poor?\u201d ", "6": "(He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) ", "7": "Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone. She bought it[c] so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. ", "8": "You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.\u201d", "9": "When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. ", "10": "So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, ", "11": "since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.", "12": "The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. ", "13": "So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, \u201cHosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord\u2014 the King of Israel!\u201d", "14": "Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it is written:", "15": "\u201cDo not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!\u201d", "16": "His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him. ", "17": "So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.[d] ", "18": "It was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him. ", "19": "The Pharisees then said to one another, \u201cYou see, you can do nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!\u201d", "20": "Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. ", "21": "They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, \u201cSir, we wish to see Jesus.\u201d ", "22": "Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. ", "23": "Jesus answered them, \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ", "24": "Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. ", "25": "Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

Others said, \u201cAn angel has spoken to him.\u201d ", "30": "Jesus answered, \u201cThis voice has come for your sake, not for mine.

", "34": "The crowd answered him, \u201cWe have heard from the law that the Messiah[f] remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?\u201d ", "35": "Jesus said to them, \u201cThe light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. ", "36": "While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.\u201d After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them. ", "37": "Although he had performed so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in him. ", "38": "This was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah: \u201cLord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\u201d", "39": "And so they could not believe, because Isaiah also said,", "40": "\u201cHe has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they might not look with their eyes, and understand with their heart and turn\u2014 and I would heal them.\u201d", "41": "Isaiah said this because[g] he saw his glory and spoke about him.

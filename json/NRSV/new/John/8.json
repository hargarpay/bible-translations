", "3": "The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, ", "4": "they said to him, \u201cTeacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. ", "5": "Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\u201d ", "6": "They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. ", "7": "When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \u201cLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ", "8": "And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground.[a] ", "9": "When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. ", "10": "Jesus straightened up and said to her, \u201cWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d ", "11": "She said, \u201cNo one, sir.\u201d[b] And Jesus said, \u201cNeither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.\u201d]][c]", "12": "Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\u201d ", "13": "Then the Pharisees said to him, \u201cYou are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.\u201d ", "14": "Jesus answered, \u201cEven if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ", "15": "You judge by human standards;[d] I judge no one. ", "16": "Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father[e] who sent me. ", "17": "In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid. ", "18": "I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.\u201d ", "19": "Then they said to him, \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\u201d ", "20": "He spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple, but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.", "21": "Again he said to them, \u201cI am going away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.\u201d ", "22": "Then the Jews said, \u201cIs he going to kill himself? Is that what he means by saying, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?\u201d ", "23": "He said to them, \u201cYou are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.

", "28": "So Jesus said, \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I am he,[h] and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things as the Father instructed me. ", "29": "And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u201d ", "30": "As he was saying these things, many believed in him.", "31": "Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, \u201cIf you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples; ", "32": "and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\u201d ", "33": "They answered him, \u201cWe are descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean by saying, 'You will be made free'?\u201d", "34": "Jesus answered them, \u201cVery truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. ", "35": "The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever. ", "36": "So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. ", "37": "I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity to kill me, because there is no place in you for my word.

This is not what Abraham did.

I did not come on my own, but he sent me. ", "43": "Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word. ", "44": "You are from your father the devil, and you choose to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. ", "45": "But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. ", "46": "Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? ", "47": "Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not from God.\u201d", "48": "The Jews answered him, \u201cAre we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?\u201d ", "49": "Jesus answered, \u201cI do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. ", "50": "Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the judge.

Abraham died, and so did the prophets; yet you say, 'Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.' ", "53": "Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died. Who do you claim to be?\u201d ", "54": "Jesus answered, \u201cIf I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, he of whom you say, 'He is our God,' ", "55": "though you do not know him. But I know him; if I would say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you.

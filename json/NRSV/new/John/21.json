", "2": "Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin,[a] Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.

", "5": "Jesus said to them, \u201cChildren, you have no fish, have you?\u201d They answered him, \u201cNo.\u201d ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cCast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.\u201d So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. ", "7": "That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. ", "8": "But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards[b] off.", "9": "When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. ", "10": "Jesus said to them, \u201cBring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u201d ", "11": "So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn.

", "13": "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. ", "14": "This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.", "15": "When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ", "16": "A second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep.\u201d ", "17": "He said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep.

Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?\u201d[d]", "24": "This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true. ", "25": "But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if every one of them were written down, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."}

", "3": "If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' just say this, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.'\u201d ", "4": "They went away and found a colt tied near a door, outside in the street. As they were untying it, ", "5": "some of the bystanders said to them, \u201cWhat are you doing, untying the colt?\u201d ", "6": "They told them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it. ", "7": "Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat on it. ", "8": "Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields. ", "9": "Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, \u201cHosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!", "10": "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!\u201d", "11": "Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple; and when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.", "12": "On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. ", "13": "Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see whether perhaps he would find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.

", "17": "He was teaching and saying, \u201cIs it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d", "18": "And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him; for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.

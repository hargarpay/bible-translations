{"1": "Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him, ", "2": "they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them. ", "3": "(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands,[a] thus observing the tradition of the elders; ", "4": "and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it;[b] and there are also many other traditions that they observe, the washing of cups, pots, and bronze kettles.[c]) ", "5": "So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, \u201cWhy do your disciples not live[d] according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?\u201d ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cIsaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;", "7": "in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.'", "8": "You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.\u201d", "9": "Then he said to them, \u201cYou have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! ", "10": "For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.' ", "11": "But you say that if anyone tells father or mother, 'Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban' (that is, an offering to God[e])\u2014 ", "12": "then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother, ", "13": "thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.\u201d", "14": "Then he called the crowd again and said to them, \u201cListen to me, all of you, and understand: ", "15": "there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.\u201d[f]", "17": "When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. ", "18": "He said to them, \u201cThen do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, ", "19": "since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?\u201d (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ", "20": "And he said, \u201cIt is what comes out of a person that defiles. ", "21": "For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder, ", "22": "adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly. ", "23": "All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.\u201d", "24": "From there he set out and went away to the region of Tyre.[g] He entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. Yet he could not escape notice, ", "25": "but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him, and she came and bowed down at his feet. ", "26": "Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.

", "32": "They brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand on him. ", "33": "He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue. ", "34": "Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, \u201cEphphatha,\u201d that is, \u201cBe opened.\u201d ", "35": "And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. ", "36": "Then Jesus[i] ordered them to tell no one; but the more he ordered them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.

", "4": "Again he sent other slaves, saying, 'Tell those who have been invited: Look, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready; come to the wedding banquet.' ", "5": "But they made light of it and went away, one to his farm, another to his business, ", "6": "while the rest seized his slaves, mistreated them, and killed them. ", "7": "The king was enraged. He sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. ", "8": "Then he said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy. ", "9": "Go therefore into the main streets, and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.' ", "10": "Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.", "11": "\u201cBut when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe, ", "12": "and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?'

I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you. ", "2": "For your part, do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; tear down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my command. See what you have done! ", "3": "So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become adversaries[a] to you, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\u201d ", "4": "When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept. ", "5": "So they named that place Bochim,[b] and there they sacrificed to the Lord.", "6": "When Joshua dismissed the people, the Israelites all went to their own inheritances to take possession of the land. ", "7": "The people worshiped the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel. ", "8": "Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred ten years.

", "2": "Then he came up, and told his father and mother, \u201cI saw a Philistine woman at Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.\u201d ", "3": "But his father and mother said to him, \u201cIs there not a woman among your kin, or among all our[a] people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?\u201d But Samson said to his father, \u201cGet her for me, because she pleases me.\u201d ", "4": "His father and mother did not know that this was from the Lord; for he was seeking a pretext to act against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.", "5": "Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah. When he came to the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion roared at him. ", "6": "The spirit of the Lord rushed on him, and he tore the lion apart barehanded as one might tear apart a kid. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. ", "7": "Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson. ", "8": "After a while he returned to marry her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.

If you can explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments. ", "13": "But if you cannot explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments.\u201d So they said to him, \u201cAsk your riddle; let us hear it.\u201d ", "14": "He said to them, \u201cOut of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet.\u201d But for three days they could not explain the riddle.", "15": "On the fourth[b] day they said to Samson's wife, \u201cCoax your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?\u201d ", "16": "So Samson's wife wept before him, saying, \u201cYou hate me; you do not really love me. You have asked a riddle of my people, but you have not explained it to me.\u201d He said to her, \u201cLook, I have not told my father or my mother. Why should I tell you?\u201d ", "17": "She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted; and because she nagged him, on the seventh day he told her.

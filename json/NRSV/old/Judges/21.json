", "3": "They said, \u201cO Lord, the God of Israel, why has it come to pass that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?\u201d ", "4": "On the next day, the people got up early, and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being. ", "5": "Then the Israelites said, \u201cWhich of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the Lord?\u201d For a solemn oath had been taken concerning whoever did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah, saying, \u201cThat one shall be put to death.\u201d ", "6": "But the Israelites had compassion for Benjamin their kin, and said, \u201cOne tribe is cut off from Israel this day. ", "7": "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them any of our daughters as wives?\u201d", "8": "Then they said, \u201cIs there anyone from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah?\u201d It turned out that no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp, to the assembly. ", "9": "For when the roll was called among the people, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. ", "10": "So the congregation sent twelve thousand soldiers there and commanded them, \u201cGo, put the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead to the sword, including the women and the little ones. ", "11": "This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction.\u201d ", "12": "And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man and brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.", "13": "Then the whole congregation sent word to the Benjaminites who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. ", "14": "Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; but they did not suffice for them.", "15": "The people had compassion on Benjamin because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. ", "16": "So the elders of the congregation said, \u201cWhat shall we do for wives for those who are left, since there are no women left in Benjamin?\u201d ", "17": "And they said, \u201cThere must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, in order that a tribe may not be blotted out from Israel.

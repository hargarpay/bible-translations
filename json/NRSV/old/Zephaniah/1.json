I will make the wicked stumble.[a] I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth, says the Lord.", "4": "I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal and the name of the idolatrous priests;[b]", "5": "those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens; those who bow down and swear to the Lord, but also swear by Milcom;[c]", "6": "those who have turned back from following the Lord, who have not sought the Lord or inquired of him.", "7": "Be silent before the Lord God! For the day of the Lord is at hand; the Lord has prepared a sacrifice, he has consecrated his guests.", "8": "And on the day of the Lord's sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king's sons and all who dress themselves in foreign attire.", "9": "On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and fraud.", "10": "On that day, says the Lord, a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, a loud crash from the hills.", "11": "The inhabitants of the Mortar wail, for all the traders have perished; all who weigh out silver are cut off.", "12": "At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the people who rest complacently[d] on their dregs, those who say in their hearts, \u201cThe Lord will not do good, nor will he do harm.\u201d", "13": "Their wealth shall be plundered, and their houses laid waste.

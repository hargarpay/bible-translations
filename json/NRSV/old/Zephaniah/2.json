The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will destroy you until no inhabitant is left.", "6": "And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures, meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.", "7": "The seacoast shall become the possession of the remnant of the house of Judah, on which they shall pasture, and in the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening. For the Lord their God will be mindful of them and restore their fortunes.", "8": "I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, how they have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory.", "9": "Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a land possessed by nettles and salt pits, and a waste forever.

What a desolation it has become, a lair for wild animals! Everyone who passes by it hisses and shakes the fist."}

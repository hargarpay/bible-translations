", "2": "Then Pashhur struck the prophet Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the Lord. ", "3": "The next morning when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, The Lord has named you not Pashhur but \u201cTerror-all-around.\u201d ", "4": "For thus says the Lord: I am making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword. ", "5": "I will give all the wealth of this city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and seize them, and carry them to Babylon. ", "6": "And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, shall go into captivity, and to Babylon you shall go; there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.", "7": "O Lord, you have enticed me, and I was enticed; you have overpowered me, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.", "8": "For whenever I speak, I must cry out, I must shout, \u201cViolence and destruction!\u201d For the word of the Lord has become for me a reproach and derision all day long.", "9": "If I say, \u201cI will not mention him, or speak any more in his name,\u201d then within me there is something like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.", "10": "For I hear many whispering: \u201cTerror is all around!

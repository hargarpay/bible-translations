But when you entered you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.", "8": "The priests did not say, \u201cWhere is the Lord?\u201d Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers[a] transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after things that do not profit.", "9": "Therefore once more I accuse you, says the Lord, and I accuse your children's children.", "10": "Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has ever been such a thing.", "11": "Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods?

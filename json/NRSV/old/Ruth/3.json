{"1": "Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, \u201cMy daughter, I need to seek some security for you, so that it may be well with you. ", "2": "Now here is our kinsman Boaz, with whose young women you have been working. See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. ", "3": "Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. ", "4": "When he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.\u201d ", "5": "She said to her, \u201cAll that you tell me I will do.\u201d", "6": "So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had instructed her. ", "7": "When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and he was in a contented mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came stealthily and uncovered his feet, and lay down. ", "8": "At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and there, lying at his feet, was a woman! ", "9": "He said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And she answered, \u201cI am Ruth, your servant; spread your cloak over your servant, for you are next-of-kin.\u201d[a] ", "10": "He said, \u201cMay you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter; this last instance of your loyalty is better than the first; you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.

If he is not willing to act as next-of-kin[c] for you, then, as the Lord lives, I will act as next-of-kin[d] for you. Lie down until the morning.\u201d", "14": "So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before one person could recognize another; for he said, \u201cIt must not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.\u201d ", "15": "Then he said, \u201cBring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out.\u201d So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and put it on her back; then he went into the city.

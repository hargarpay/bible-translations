In great fear the Israelites cried out to the Lord. ", "11": "They said to Moses, \u201cWas it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt? ", "12": "Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, 'Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians'?

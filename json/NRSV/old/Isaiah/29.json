Add year to year; let the festivals run their round.", "2": "Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and Jerusalem[a] shall be to me like an Ariel.[b]", "3": "And like David[c] I will encamp against you; I will besiege you with towers and raise siegeworks against you.", "4": "Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.", "5": "But the multitude of your foes[d] shall be like small dust, and the multitude of tyrants like flying chaff. And in an instant, suddenly,", "6": "you will be visited by the Lord of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.", "7": "And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.", "8": "Just as when a hungry person dreams of eating and wakes up still hungry, or a thirsty person dreams of drinking and wakes up faint, still thirsty, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.", "9": "Stupefy yourselves and be in a stupor, blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not from wine; stagger, but not from strong drink!", "10": "For the Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep; he has closed your eyes, you prophets, and covered your heads, you seers.", "11": "The vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document. If it is given to those who can read, with the command, \u201cRead this,\u201d they say, \u201cWe cannot, for it is sealed.\u201d ", "12": "And if it is given to those who cannot read, saying, \u201cRead this,\u201d they say, \u201cWe cannot read.\u201d", "13": "The Lord said: Because these people draw near with their mouths and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their worship of me is a human commandment learned by rote;", "14": "so I will again do amazing things with this people, shocking and amazing. The wisdom of their wise shall perish, and the discernment of the discerning shall be hidden.", "15": "Ha! You who hide a plan too deep for the Lord, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, \u201cWho sees us? Who knows us?\u201d", "16": "You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay? Shall the thing made say of its maker, \u201cHe did not make me\u201d; or the thing formed say of the one who formed it, \u201cHe has no understanding\u201d?", "17": "Shall not Lebanon in a very little while become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be regarded as a forest?", "18": "On that day the deaf shall hear the words of a scroll, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.", "19": "The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the Lord, and the neediest people shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.", "20": "For the tyrant shall be no more, and the scoffer shall cease to be; all those alert to do evil shall be cut off\u2014", "21": "those who cause a person to lose a lawsuit, who set a trap for the arbiter in the gate, and without grounds deny justice to the one in the right.", "22": "Therefore thus says the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: No longer shall Jacob be ashamed, no longer shall his face grow pale.", "23": "For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.", "24": "And those who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction."}

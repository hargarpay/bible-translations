Let the earth hear, and all that fills it; the world, and all that comes from it.", "2": "For the Lord is enraged against all the nations, and furious against all their hordes; he has doomed them, has given them over for slaughter.", "3": "Their slain shall be cast out, and the stench of their corpses shall rise; the mountains shall flow with their blood.", "4": "All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall wither like a leaf withering on a vine, or fruit withering on a fig tree.", "5": "When my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens, lo, it will descend upon Edom, upon the people I have doomed to judgment.", "6": "The Lord has a sword; it is sated with blood, it is gorged with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.", "7": "Wild oxen shall fall with them, and young steers with the mighty bulls. Their land shall be soaked with blood, and their soil made rich with fat.", "8": "For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of vindication by Zion's cause.[a]", "9": "And the streams of Edom[b] shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch.", "10": "Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever.

", "27": "After the Israelites had been mustered and provisioned, they went out to engage them; the people of Israel encamped opposite them like two little flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the country. ", "28": "A man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, \u201cThus says the Lord: Because the Arameans have said, 'The Lord is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys,' therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.\u201d ", "29": "They encamped opposite one another seven days.

He is my brother.\u201d ", "33": "Now the men were watching for an omen; they quickly took it up from him and said, \u201cYes, Ben-hadad is your brother.\u201d Then he said, \u201cGo and bring him.\u201d So Ben-hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot.

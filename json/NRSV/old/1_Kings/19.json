", "2": "Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, \u201cSo may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.\u201d ", "3": "Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there.", "4": "But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: \u201cIt is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.\u201d ", "5": "Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, \u201cGet up and eat.\u201d ", "6": "He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. ", "7": "The angel of the Lord came a second time, touched him, and said, \u201cGet up and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you.\u201d ", "8": "He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. ", "9": "At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there. Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Elijah?\u201d ", "10": "He answered, \u201cI have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.\u201d", "11": "He said, \u201cGo out and stand on the mountain before the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.\u201d Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; ", "12": "and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence.

Then he set out and followed Elijah, and became his servant."}

Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?\u201d ", "32": "So the man came into the house; and Laban unloaded the camels, and gave him straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

When they rose in the morning, he said, \u201cSend me back to my master.\u201d ", "55": "Her brother and her mother said, \u201cLet the girl remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.\u201d ", "56": "But he said to them, \u201cDo not delay me, since the Lord has made my journey successful; let me go that I may go to my master.\u201d ", "57": "They said, \u201cWe will call the girl, and ask her.\u201d ", "58": "And they called Rebekah, and said to her, \u201cWill you go with this man?\u201d She said, \u201cI will.\u201d ", "59": "So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham's servant and his men.

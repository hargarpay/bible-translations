{"1": "David said in his heart, \u201cI shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines; then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.\u201d ", "2": "So David set out and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath.

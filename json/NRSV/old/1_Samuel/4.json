In those days the Philistines mustered for war against Israel,[a] and Israel went out to battle against them;[b] they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. ", "2": "The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle was joined,[c] Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle. ", "3": "When the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, \u201cWhy has the Lord put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord here from Shiloh, so that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.\u201d ", "4": "So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.", "5": "When the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded. ", "6": "When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, \u201cWhat does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?\u201d When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come to the camp, ", "7": "the Philistines were afraid; for they said, \u201cGods have[d] come into the camp.\u201d They also said, \u201cWoe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. ", "8": "Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness. ", "9": "Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, in order not to become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.\u201d", "10": "So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated, and they fled, everyone to his home. There was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. ", "11": "The ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.", "12": "A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with earth upon his head. ", "13": "When he arrived, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out. ", "14": "When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, \u201cWhat is this uproar?\u201d Then the man came quickly and told Eli. ", "15": "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set, so that he could not see. ", "16": "The man said to Eli, \u201cI have just come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.\u201d He said, \u201cHow did it go, my son?\u201d ", "17": "The messenger replied, \u201cIsrael has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the troops; your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.\u201d ", "18": "When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli[e] fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.", "19": "Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth.

", "3": "He came to the sheepfolds beside the road, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself.[a] Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. ", "4": "The men of David said to him, \u201cHere is the day of which the Lord said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'\u201d Then David went and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's cloak. ", "5": "Afterward David was stricken to the heart because he had cut off a corner of Saul's cloak. ", "6": "He said to his men, \u201cThe Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, to raise my hand against him; for he is the Lord's anointed.\u201d ", "7": "So David scolded his men severely and did not permit them to attack Saul.

I said, 'I will not raise my hand against my lord; for he is the Lord's anointed.'

{"1": "The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cHow long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.\u201d ", "2": "Samuel said, \u201cHow can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cTake a heifer with you, and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.' ", "3": "Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.\u201d ", "4": "Samuel did what the Lord commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, \u201cDo you come peaceably?\u201d ", "5": "He said, \u201cPeaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.\u201d And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.", "6": "When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, \u201cSurely the Lord's anointed is now before the Lord.\u201d[a] ", "7": "But the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDo not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the Lord does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.\u201d ", "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, \u201cNeither has the Lord chosen this one.\u201d ", "9": "Then Jesse made Shammah pass by.

Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The Lord said, \u201cRise and anoint him; for this is the one.\u201d ", "13": "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward.

The Lord answered him, \u201cYes, go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into your hand.\u201d ", "5": "So David and his men went to Keilah, fought with the Philistines, brought away their livestock, and dealt them a heavy defeat. Thus David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.", "6": "When Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. ", "7": "Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, \u201cGod has given[a] him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.\u201d ", "8": "Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

", "11": "And now, will[b] Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Lord, the God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.\u201d The Lord said, \u201cHe will come down.\u201d ", "12": "Then David said, \u201cWill the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cThey will surrender you.\u201d ", "13": "Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they wandered wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition. ", "14": "David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but the Lord[c] did not give him into his hand.", "15": "David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh when he learned that[d] Saul had come out to seek his life. ", "16": "Saul's son Jonathan set out and came to David at Horesh; there he strengthened his hand through the Lord.[e] ", "17": "He said to him, \u201cDo not be afraid; for the hand of my father Saul shall not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you; my father Saul also knows that this is so.\u201d ", "18": "Then the two of them made a covenant before the Lord; David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.", "19": "Then some Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, \u201cDavid is hiding among us in the strongholds of Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon.

Then I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.\u201d ", "24": "So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. ", "25": "Saul and his men went to search for him. When David was told, he went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon.

David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. ", "27": "Then a messenger came to Saul, saying, \u201cHurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.\u201d ", "28": "So Saul stopped pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.[f] ", "29": "[g] David then went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi."}

And Ishbaal[a] said to Abner, \u201cWhy have you gone in to my father's concubine?\u201d ", "8": "The words of Ishbaal[b] made Abner very angry; he said, \u201cAm I a dog's head for Judah? Today I keep showing loyalty to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me now with a crime concerning this woman.

But one thing I require of you: you shall never appear in my presence unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal when you come to see me.\u201d ", "14": "Then David sent messengers to Saul's son Ishbaal,[e] saying, \u201cGive me my wife Michal, to whom I became engaged at the price of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.\u201d ", "15": "Ishbaal[f] sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.

", "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway to speak with him privately, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. So he died for shedding[h] the blood of Asahel, Joab's[i] brother. ", "28": "Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, \u201cI and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the Lord for the blood of Abner son of Ner. ", "29": "May the guilt[j] fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous,[k] or who holds a spindle, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks food!\u201d ", "30": "So Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.", "31": "Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, \u201cTear your clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourn over Abner.\u201d And King David followed the bier.

", "35": "Then all the people came to persuade David to eat something while it was still day; but David swore, saying, \u201cSo may God do to me, and more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!\u201d ", "36": "All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; just as everything the king did pleased all the people. ", "37": "So all the people and all Israel understood that day that the king had no part in the killing of Abner son of Ner. ", "38": "And the king said to his servants, \u201cDo you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?

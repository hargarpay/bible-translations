{"1": "After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him. ", "2": "Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the road into the gate; and when anyone brought a suit before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out and say, \u201cFrom what city are you?\u201d When the person said, \u201cYour servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,\u201d ", "3": "Absalom would say, \u201cSee, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you.\u201d ", "4": "Absalom said moreover, \u201cIf only I were judge in the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice.\u201d ", "5": "Whenever people came near to do obeisance to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of them, and kiss them. ", "6": "Thus Absalom did to every Israelite who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.", "7": "At the end of four[a] years Absalom said to the king, \u201cPlease let me go to Hebron and pay the vow that I have made to the Lord. ", "8": "For your servant made a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram: If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will worship the Lord in Hebron.\u201d[b] ", "9": "The king said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d So he got up, and went to Hebron. ", "10": "But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, \u201cAs soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then shout: Absalom has become king at Hebron!\u201d ", "11": "Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom; they were invited guests, and they went in their innocence, knowing nothing of the matter. ", "12": "While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for[c] Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh. The conspiracy grew in strength, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.", "13": "A messenger came to David, saying, \u201cThe hearts of the Israelites have gone after Absalom.\u201d ", "14": "Then David said to all his officials who were with him at Jerusalem, \u201cGet up! Let us flee, or there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry, or he will soon overtake us, and bring disaster down upon us, and attack the city with the edge of the sword.\u201d ", "15": "The king's officials said to the king, \u201cYour servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king decides.\u201d ", "16": "So the king left, followed by all his household, except ten concubines whom he left behind to look after the house. ", "17": "The king left, followed by all the people; and they stopped at the last house. ", "18": "All his officials passed by him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.", "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, \u201cWhy are you also coming with us? Go back, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from your home. ", "20": "You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, while I go wherever I can? Go back, and take your kinsfolk with you; and may the Lord show[d] steadfast love and faithfulness to you.\u201d ", "21": "But Ittai answered the king, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be.\u201d ", "22": "David said to Ittai, \u201cGo then, march on.\u201d So Ittai the Gittite marched on, with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. ", "23": "The whole country wept aloud as all the people passed by; the king crossed the Wadi Kidron, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.", "24": "Abiathar came up, and Zadok also, with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city. ", "25": "Then the king said to Zadok, \u201cCarry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back and let me see both it and the place where it stays. ", "26": "But if he says, 'I take no pleasure in you,' here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.\u201d ", "27": "The king also said to the priest Zadok, \u201cLook,[e] go back to the city in peace, you and Abiathar,[f] with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar. ", "28": "See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.\u201d ", "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.", "30": "But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot; and all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went. ", "31": "David was told that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, \u201cO Lord, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.\u201d", "32": "When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head. ", "33": "David said to him, \u201cIf you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. ", "34": "But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. ", "35": "The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there. So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to the priests Zadok and Abiathar. ", "36": "Their two sons are with them there, Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan; and by them you shall report to me everything you hear.\u201d ", "37": "So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem."}

", "3": "King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against him; Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute. ", "4": "But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to King So of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria confined him and imprisoned him.", "5": "Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria; for three years he besieged it. ", "6": "In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria; he carried the Israelites away to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.", "7": "This occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods ", "8": "and walked in the customs of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had introduced.[a] ", "9": "The people of Israel secretly did things that were not right against the Lord their God.

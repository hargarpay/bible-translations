", "2": "When you arrive, look there for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi; go in and get him to leave his companions, and take him into an inner chamber. ", "3": "Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, 'Thus says the Lord: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and flee; do not linger.\u201d", "4": "So the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. ", "5": "He arrived while the commanders of the army were in council, and he announced, \u201cI have a message for you, commander.\u201d \u201cFor which one of us?\u201d asked Jehu. \u201cFor you, commander.\u201d ", "6": "So Jehu[b] got up and went inside; the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, \u201cThus says the Lord the God of Israel: I anoint you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel. ", "7": "You shall strike down the house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord. ", "8": "For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.

", "10": "The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one shall bury her.\u201d Then he opened the door and fled.", "11": "When Jehu came back to his master's officers, they said to him, \u201cIs everything all right? Why did that madman come to you?\u201d He answered them, \u201cYou know the sort and how they babble.\u201d ", "12": "They said, \u201cLiar! Come on, tell us!\u201d So he said, \u201cThis is just what he said to me: 'Thus says the Lord, I anoint you king over Israel.'\u201d ", "13": "Then hurriedly they all took their cloaks and spread them for him on the bare[c] steps; and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, \u201cJehu is king.\u201d", "14": "Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against King Hazael of Aram; ", "15": "but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him, when he fought against King Hazael of Aram. So Jehu said, \u201cIf this is your wish, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.\u201d ", "16": "Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, where Joram was lying ill. King Ahaziah of Judah had come down to visit Joram.", "17": "In Jezreel, the sentinel standing on the tower spied the company of Jehu arriving, and said, \u201cI see a company.\u201d Joram said, \u201cTake a horseman; send him to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'\u201d ", "18": "So the horseman went to meet him; he said, \u201cThus says the king, 'Is it peace?'\u201d Jehu responded, \u201cWhat have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me.\u201d The sentinel reported, saying, \u201cThe messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.\u201d ", "19": "Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, \u201cThus says the king, 'Is it peace?'\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cWhat have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me.\u201d ", "20": "Again the sentinel reported, \u201cHe reached them, but he is not coming back. It looks like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi; for he drives like a maniac.\u201d", "21": "Joram said, \u201cGet ready.\u201d And they got his chariot ready. Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu; they met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. ", "22": "When Joram saw Jehu, he said, \u201cIs it peace, Jehu?\u201d He answered, \u201cWhat peace can there be, so long as the many whoredoms and sorceries of your mother Jezebel continue?\u201d ", "23": "Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, \u201cTreason, Ahaziah!\u201d ", "24": "Jehu drew his bow with all his strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart; and he sank in his chariot. ", "25": "Jehu said to his aide Bidkar, \u201cLift him out, and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind his father Ahab how the Lord uttered this oracle against him: ", "26": "'For the blood of Naboth and for the blood of his children that I saw yesterday, says the Lord, I swear I will repay you on this very plot of ground.' Now therefore lift him out and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the Lord.\u201d", "27": "When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, saying, \u201cShoot him also!\u201d And they shot him[d] in the chariot at the ascent to Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there.

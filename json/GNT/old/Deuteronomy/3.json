I am going to give him, his men, and all his territory to you. Do the same thing to him that you did to Sihon the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon.'", "3": "\u201cSo the Lord also placed King Og and his people in our power, and we slaughtered them all. ", "4": "At the same time we captured all his towns\u2014there was not one that we did not take. In all we captured sixty towns\u2014the whole region of Argob, where King Og of Bashan ruled.

His coffin,[a] made of stone,[b] was six feet wide and almost fourteen feet long, according to standard measurements.

", "16": "And to the tribes of Reuben and Gad I assigned the territory from Gilead to the Arnon River. The middle of the river was their southern boundary, and their northern boundary was the Jabbok River, part of which formed the Ammonite border.

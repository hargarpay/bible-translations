As you advance, he will drive out seven nations larger and more powerful than you: the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. ", "2": "When the Lord your God places these people in your power and you defeat them, you must put them all to death. Do not make an alliance with them or show them any mercy. ", "3": "Do not marry any of them, and do not let your children marry any of them, ", "4": "because then they would lead your children away from the Lord to worship other gods. If that happens, the Lord will be angry with you and destroy you at once. ", "5": "So then, tear down their altars, break their sacred stone pillars in pieces, cut down their symbols of the goddess Asherah, and burn their idols. ", "6": "Do this because you belong to the Lord your God. From all the peoples on earth he chose you to be his own special people.", "7": "\u201cThe Lord did not love you and choose you because you outnumbered other peoples; you were the smallest nation on earth. ", "8": "But the Lord loved you and wanted to keep the promise that he made to your ancestors. That is why he saved you by his great might and set you free from slavery to the king of Egypt.

He will give you all these blessings in the land that he promised your ancestors he would give to you. ", "14": "No people in the world will be as richly blessed as you. None of you nor any of your livestock will be sterile. ", "15": "The Lord will protect you from all sickness, and he will not bring on you any of the dreadful diseases that you experienced in Egypt, but he will bring them on all your enemies. ", "16": "Destroy every nation that the Lord your God places in your power, and do not show them any mercy.

No one will be able to stop you; you will destroy everyone. ", "25": "Burn their idols. Do not desire the silver or gold that is on them, and do not take it for yourselves. If you do, that will be fatal, because the Lord hates idolatry. ", "26": "Do not bring any of these idols into your homes, or the same curse will be on you that is on them. You must hate and despise these idols, because they are under the Lord's curse."}

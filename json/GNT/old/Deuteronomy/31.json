", "3": "The Lord your God himself will go before you and destroy the nations living there, so that you can occupy their land; and Joshua will be your leader, as the Lord has said. ", "4": "The Lord will destroy those people, just as he defeated Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites, and destroyed their country.

", "8": "The Lord himself will lead you and be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you, so do not lose courage or be afraid.\u201d", "9": "So Moses wrote down God's Law and gave it to the levitical priests, who were in charge of the Lord's Covenant Box, and to the leaders of Israel.

Come up to me on the mountain, ", "2": "and I will write on those tablets what I wrote on the tablets that you broke, and then you are to put them in the Box.'", "3": "\u201cSo I made a Box of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first ones and took them up the mountain.

The Lord gave me the tablets, ", "5": "and I turned and went down the mountain. Then, just as the Lord had commanded, I put them in the Box that I had made\u2014and they have been there ever since.\u201d", "6": "(6\u00a0The Israelites set out from the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan, and went to Moserah.

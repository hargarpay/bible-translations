In the shadow of your wings I sing for joy.", "8": "I cling to you, and your hand keeps me safe.", "9": "Those who are trying to kill me will go down into the world of the dead.", "10": "They will be killed in battle, and their bodies eaten by wolves.", "11": "Because God gives him victory, the king will rejoice. Those who make promises in God's name will praise him, but the mouths of liars will be shut."}

When can I go and worship in your presence?", "3": "Day and night I cry, and tears are my only food; all the time my enemies ask me, \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d", "4": "My heart breaks when I remember the past, when I went with the crowds to the house of God and led them as they walked along, a happy crowd, singing and shouting praise to God.", "5": "Why am I so sad? Why am I so troubled? I will put my hope in God, and once again I will praise him, my savior and my God.", "6-7": "Here in exile my heart is breaking, and so I turn my thoughts to him.

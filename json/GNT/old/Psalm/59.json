{"1": "Save me from my enemies, my God; protect me from those who attack me!", "2": "Save me from those evil people; rescue me from those murderers!", "3": "Look! They are waiting to kill me; cruel people are gathering against me. It is not because of any sin or wrong I have done,", "4": "nor because of any fault of mine, O Lord, that they hurry to their places.", "5": "Rise, Lord God Almighty, and come to my aid; see for yourself, God of Israel! Wake up and punish the heathen; show no mercy to evil traitors!", "6": "They come back in the evening, snarling like dogs as they go about the city.", "7": "Listen to their insults and threats. Their tongues are like swords in their mouths, yet they think that no one hears them.", "8": "But you laugh at them, Lord; you mock all the heathen.", "9": "I have confidence in your strength; you are my refuge, O God.", "10": "My God loves me and will come to me; he will let me see my enemies defeated.", "11": "Do not kill them, O God, or my people may forget. Scatter them by your strength and defeat them, O Lord, our protector.", "12": "Sin is on their lips; all their words are sinful; may they be caught in their pride! Because they curse and lie,", "13": "destroy them in your anger; destroy them completely. Then everyone will know that God rules in Israel, that his rule extends over all the earth.", "14": "My enemies come back in the evening, snarling like dogs as they go about the city,", "15": "like dogs roaming about for food and growling if they do not find enough.", "16": "But I will sing about your strength; every morning I will sing aloud of your constant love. You have been a refuge for me, a shelter in my time of trouble.", "17": "I will praise you, my defender. My refuge is God, the God who loves me."}

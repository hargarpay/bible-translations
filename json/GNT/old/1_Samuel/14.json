Some Hebrews are coming out of the holes they have been hiding in!\u201d ", "12": "Then they called out to Jonathan and the young man, \u201cCome on up here! We have something to tell[b] you!\u201d Jonathan said to the young man, \u201cFollow me.

The Lord saved Israel that day.", "24": "The Israelites were weak with hunger that day, because Saul, with a solemn oath, had given the order: \u201cA curse be on anyone who eats any food today before I take revenge on my enemies.\u201d So nobody had eaten anything all day.

At once he felt much better.

Lord, God of Israel, answer me by the sacred stones. If the guilt is Jonathan's or mine, answer by the Urim; but if it belongs to your people Israel,[i] answer by the Thummim.\u201d[j] The answer indicated Jonathan and Saul; and the people were cleared.

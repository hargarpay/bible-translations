If I find out anything, I will let you know.\u201d", "4": "Jonathan praised David to Saul and said, \u201cSir, don't do wrong to your servant David. He has never done you any wrong; on the contrary, everything he has done has been a great help to you. ", "5": "He risked his life when he killed Goliath, and the Lord won a great victory for Israel. When you saw it, you were glad. Why, then, do you now want to do wrong to an innocent man and kill David for no reason at all?\u201d", "6": "Saul was convinced by what Jonathan said and made a vow in the Lord's name that he would not kill David. ", "7": "So Jonathan called David and told him everything; then he took him to Saul, and David served the king as he had before.", "8": "War with the Philistines broke out again.

", "14": "When Saul's men came to get David, Michal told them that he was sick. ", "15": "But Saul sent them back to see David for themselves.

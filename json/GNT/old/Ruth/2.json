I am sure to find someone who will let me work with him.\u201d Naomi answered, \u201cGo ahead, daughter.\u201d", "3": "So Ruth went out to the fields and walked behind the workers, picking up the heads of grain which they left. It so happened that she was in a field that belonged to Boaz.", "4": "Some time later Boaz himself arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the workers. \u201cThe Lord be with you!\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lord bless you!\u201d they answered.", "5": "Boaz asked the man in charge, \u201cWho is that young woman?\u201d", "6": "The man answered, \u201cShe is the foreigner who came back from Moab with Naomi. ", "7": "She asked me to let her follow the workers and gather grain. She has been working since early morning and has just now stopped to rest for a while under the shelter.\u201d", "8": "Then Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cLet me give you some advice. Don't gather grain anywhere except in this field. Work with the women here; ", "9": "watch them to see where they are reaping and stay with them. I have ordered my men not to molest you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and drink from the water jars that they have filled.\u201d", "10": "Ruth bowed down with her face touching the ground, and said to Boaz, \u201cWhy should you be so concerned about me? Why should you be so kind to a foreigner?\u201d", "11": "Boaz answered, \u201cI have heard about everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died.

She ate until she was satisfied, and she still had some food left over. ", "15-16": "After she had left to go and gather grain, Boaz ordered the workers, \u201cLet her gather grain even where the bundles are lying, and don't say anything to stop her. Besides that, pull out some heads of grain from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up.\u201d", "17": "So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening, and when she had beaten it out, she found she had nearly twenty-five pounds.

May God bless the man who took an interest in you!\u201d So Ruth told Naomi that she had been working in a field belonging to a man named Boaz.", "20": "\u201cMay the Lord bless Boaz!\u201d Naomi exclaimed. \u201cThe Lord always keeps his promises to the living and the dead.\u201d And she went on, \u201cThat man is a close relative of ours, one of those responsible for taking care of us.\u201d", "21": "Then Ruth said, \u201cBest of all, he told me to keep gathering grain with his workers until they finish the harvest.\u201d", "22": "Naomi said to Ruth, \u201cYes, daughter, it will be better for you to work with the women in Boaz' field. You might be molested if you went to someone else's field.\u201d ", "23": "So Ruth worked with them and gathered grain until all the barley and wheat had been harvested. And she continued to live with her mother-in-law."}

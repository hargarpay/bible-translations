", "3": "The king asked them, \u201cWhat is your occupation?\u201d \u201cWe are shepherds, sir, just as our ancestors were,\u201d they answered. ", "4": "\u201cWe have come to live in this country, because in the land of Canaan the famine is so severe that there is no pasture for our flocks. Please give us permission to live in the region of Goshen.\u201d ", "5": "The king said to Joseph, \u201cNow that your father and your brothers have arrived, ", "6": "the land of Egypt is theirs.

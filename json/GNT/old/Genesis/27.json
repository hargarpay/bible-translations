", "3": "Take your bow and arrows, go out into the country, and kill an animal for me. ", "4": "Cook me some of that tasty food that I like, and bring it to me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my final blessing before I die.\u201d", "5": "While Isaac was talking to Esau, Rebecca was listening. So when Esau went out to hunt, ", "6": "she said to Jacob, \u201cI have just heard your father say to Esau, ", "7": "'Bring me an animal and cook it for me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.' ", "8": "Now, son,\u201d Rebecca continued, \u201clisten to me and do what I say. ", "9": "Go to the flock and pick out two fat young goats, so that I can cook them and make some of that food your father likes so much. ", "10": "You can take it to him to eat, and he will give you his blessing before he dies.\u201d", "11": "But Jacob said to his mother, \u201cYou know that Esau is a hairy man, but I have smooth skin. ", "12": "Perhaps my father will touch me and find out that I am deceiving him; in this way, I will bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.\u201d", "13": "His mother answered, \u201cLet any curse against you fall on me, my son; just do as I say, and go and get the goats for me.\u201d ", "14": "So he went to get them and brought them to her, and she cooked the kind of food that his father liked.

Please sit up and eat some of the meat that I have brought you, so that you can give me your blessing.\u201d", "20": "Isaac said, \u201cHow did you find it so quickly, son?\u201d Jacob answered, \u201cThe Lord your God helped me find it.\u201d", "21": "Isaac said to Jacob, \u201cPlease come closer so that I can touch you. Are you really Esau?\u201d ", "22": "Jacob moved closer to his father, who felt him and said, \u201cYour voice sounds like Jacob's voice, but your arms feel like Esau's arms.\u201d ", "23": "He did not recognize Jacob, because his arms were hairy like Esau's.

He said, \u201cThe pleasant smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed. ", "28": "May God give you dew from heaven and make your fields fertile! May he give you plenty of grain and wine! ", "29": "May nations be your servants, and may peoples bow down before you. May you rule over all your relatives, and may your mother's descendants bow down before you. May those who curse you be cursed, and may those who bless you be blessed.\u201d", "30": "Isaac finished giving his blessing, and as soon as Jacob left, his brother Esau came in from hunting. ", "31": "He also cooked some tasty food and took it to his father. He said, \u201cPlease, father, sit up and eat some of the meat that I have brought you, so that you can give me your blessing.\u201d", "32": "\u201cWho are you?\u201d Isaac asked. \u201cYour older son Esau,\u201d he answered.", "33": "Isaac began to tremble and shake all over, and he asked, \u201cWho was it, then, who killed an animal and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came. I gave him my final blessing, and so it is his forever.\u201d", "34": "When Esau heard this, he cried out loudly and bitterly and said, \u201cGive me your blessing also, father!\u201d", "35": "Isaac answered, \u201cYour brother came and deceived me. He has taken away your blessing.\u201d", "36": "Esau said, \u201cThis is the second time that he has cheated me. No wonder his name is Jacob.[a] He took my rights as the first-born son, and now he has taken away my blessing. Haven't you saved a blessing for me?\u201d", "37": "Isaac answered, \u201cI have already made him master over you, and I have made all his relatives his slaves. I have given him grain and wine. Now there is nothing that I can do for you, son!\u201d", "38": "Esau continued to plead with his father: \u201cDo you have only one blessing, father? Bless me too, father!\u201d He began to cry.", "39": "Then Isaac said to him, \u201cNo dew from heaven for you, No fertile fields for you.", "40": "You will live by your sword, But be your brother's slave. Yet when you rebel,[b] You will break away from his control.\u201d", "41": "Esau hated Jacob, because his father had given Jacob the blessing. He thought, \u201cThe time to mourn my father's death is near; then I will kill Jacob.\u201d", "42": "But when Rebecca heard about Esau's plan, she sent for Jacob and said, \u201cListen, your brother Esau is planning to get even with you and kill you. ", "43": "Now, son, do what I say. Go at once to my brother Laban in Haran, ", "44": "and stay with him for a while, until your brother's anger cools down ", "45": "and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send someone to bring you back. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?\u201d", "46": "Rebecca said to Isaac, \u201cI am sick and tired of Esau's foreign wives. If Jacob also marries one of these Hittites, I might as well die.\u201d"}

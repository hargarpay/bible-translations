", "6": "If you have any more sons, they will not be considered mine; the inheritance they get will come through Ephraim and Manasseh. ", "7": "I am doing this because of your mother Rachel. To my great sorrow she died in the land of Canaan, not far from Ephrath, as I was returning from Mesopotamia.

May God, who has led me to this very day, bless them!", "16": "May the angel, who has rescued me from all harm, bless them! May my name and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac live on through these boys!

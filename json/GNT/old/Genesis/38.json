Fulfill your obligation to her as her husband's brother, so that your brother may have descendants.\u201d ", "9": "But Onan knew that the children would not belong to him, so when he had intercourse with his brother's widow, he let the semen spill on the ground, so that there would be no children for his brother. ", "10": "What he did displeased the Lord, and the Lord killed him also. ", "11": "Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, \u201cReturn to your father's house and remain a widow until my son Shelah grows up.\u201d He said this because he was afraid that Shelah would be killed, as his brothers had been.

I have failed in my obligation to her\u2014I should have given her to my son Shelah in marriage.\u201d And Judah never had intercourse with her again.", "27": "When the time came for her to give birth, it was discovered that she was going to have twins.

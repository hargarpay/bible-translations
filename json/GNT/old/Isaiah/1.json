The children I brought up have rebelled against me. ", "3": "Cattle know who owns them, and donkeys know where their master feeds them. But that is more than my people Israel know. They don't understand at all.\u201d", "4": "You are doomed, you sinful nation, you corrupt and evil people! Your sins drag you down! You have rejected the Lord, the holy God of Israel, and have turned your backs on him. ", "5": "Why do you keep on rebelling? Do you want to be punished even more?

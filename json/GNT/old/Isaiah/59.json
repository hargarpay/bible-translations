It is your sins that separate you from God when you try to worship him. ", "3": "You are guilty of lying, violence, and murder.", "4": "You go to court, but you do not have justice on your side. You depend on lies to win your case. You carry out your plans to hurt others. ", "5-6": "The evil plots you make are as deadly as the eggs of a poisonous snake. Crush an egg, out comes a snake!

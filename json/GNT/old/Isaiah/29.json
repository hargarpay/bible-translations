", "4": "Jerusalem will be like a ghost struggling to speak from under the ground, a muffled voice coming from the dust.", "5": "Jerusalem, all the foreigners who attack you will be blown away like dust, and their terrifying armies will fly away like straw. Suddenly and unexpectedly ", "6": "the Lord Almighty will rescue you with violent thunderstorms and earthquakes.

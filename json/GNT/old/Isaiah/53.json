Who could have seen the Lord's hand in this?", "2": "It was the will of the Lord that his servant grow like a plant taking root in dry ground.

No one would even look at him\u2014 we ignored him as if he were nothing.", "4": "\u201cBut he endured the suffering that should have been ours, the pain that we should have borne.

He willingly gave his life and shared the fate of evil men. He took the place of many sinners and prayed that they might be forgiven.\u201d[a]"}

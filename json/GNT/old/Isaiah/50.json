Do you think I sold you into captivity like a man who sells his children as slaves? No, you went away captive because of your sins; you were sent away because of your crimes.", "2": "\u201cWhy did my people fail to respond when I went to them to save them? Why did they not answer when I called? Am I too weak to save them? I can dry up the sea with a command and turn rivers into a desert, so that the fish in them die for lack of water.", "3": "I can make the sky turn dark, as if it were in mourning for the dead.\u201d", "4": "The Sovereign Lord has taught me what to say, so that I can strengthen the weary. Every morning he makes me eager to hear what he is going to teach me.", "5": "The Lord has given me understanding, and I have not rebelled or turned away from him.", "6": "I bared my back to those who beat me.

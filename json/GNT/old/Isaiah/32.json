", "3": "Their eyes and ears will be open to the needs of the people. ", "4": "They will not be impatient any longer, but they will act with understanding and will say what they mean. ", "5": "No one will think that a fool is honorable or say that a scoundrel is honest. ", "6": "A fool speaks foolishly and thinks up evil things to do. What he does and what he says are an insult to the Lord, and he never feeds the hungry or gives thirsty people anything to drink.

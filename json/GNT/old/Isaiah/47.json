You are now a slave!", "2": "Turn the millstone! Grind the flour! Off with your veil! Strip off your fine clothes! Lift up your skirts to cross the streams![a]", "3": "People will see you naked; they will see you humbled and shamed. I will take vengeance, and no one will stop me.\u201d", "4": "The holy God of Israel sets us free\u2014 his name is the Lord Almighty.", "5": "The Lord says to Babylon, \u201cSit in silence and darkness; no more will they call you the queen of nations!", "6": "I was angry with my people; I treated them as no longer mine: I put them in your power, and you showed them no mercy; even the aged you treated harshly.", "7": "You thought you would always be a queen, and did not take these things to heart or think how it all would end.", "8": "\u201cListen to this, you lover of pleasure, you that think you are safe and secure.

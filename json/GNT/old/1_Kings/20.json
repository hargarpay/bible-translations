Give us permission to go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our necks, and maybe he will spare your life.\u201d ", "32": "So they wrapped sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their necks, went to Ahab and said, \u201cYour servant Benhadad pleads with you for his life.\u201d Ahab answered, \u201cIs he still alive? Good! He's like a brother to me!\u201d", "33": "Benhadad's officials were watching for a good sign, and when Ahab said \u201cbrother,\u201d they took it up at once, and said, \u201cAs you say, Benhadad is your brother!\u201d \u201cBring him to me,\u201d Ahab ordered. When Benhadad arrived, Ahab invited him to get in the chariot with him. ", "34": "Benhadad said to him, \u201cI will restore to you the towns my father took from your father, and you may set up a commercial center for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria.\u201d Ahab replied, \u201cOn these terms, then, I will set you free.\u201d He made a treaty with him and let him go.", "35": "At the Lord's command a member of a group of prophets ordered a fellow prophet to hit him.

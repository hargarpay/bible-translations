The vine was covered with branches and leaves.", "7": "\u201cThere was another giant eagle with huge wings and thick plumage. And now the vine sent its roots toward him and turned its leaves toward him, in the hope that he would give it more water than there was in the garden where it was growing.[b] ", "8": "But the vine had already been planted in a fertile, well-watered field so that it could grow leaves and bear grapes and be a magnificent vine.", "9": "\u201cSo I, the Sovereign Lord, ask: Will this vine live and grow?

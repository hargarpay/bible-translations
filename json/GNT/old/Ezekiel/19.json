{"1": "The Lord told me to sing this song of sorrow for two princes of Israel:", "2": "What a lioness your mother was! She raised her cubs among the fierce male lions.", "3": "She raised a cub and taught him to hunt; he learned to eat people.", "4": "The nations heard about him and trapped him in a pit. With hooks they dragged him off to Egypt.", "5": "She waited until she saw all hope was gone. Then she raised another of her cubs, and he grew into a fierce lion.", "6": "When he was full-grown, he prowled with the other lions. He too learned to hunt and eat people.", "7": "He wrecked forts,[a] he ruined towns. The people of the land were terrified every time he roared.", "8": "The nations gathered to fight him; people came from everywhere. They spread their hunting nets and caught him in their trap.", "9": "They put him in a cage and took him to the king of Babylonia. They kept him under guard, so that his roar would never be heard again on the hills of Israel.", "10": "Your mother was like a grapevine[b] planted near a stream. Because there was plenty of water, the vine was covered with leaves and fruit.", "11": "Its branches were strong and grew to be royal scepters. The vine grew tall enough to reach the clouds; everyone saw how leafy and tall it was.", "12": "But angry hands pulled it up by the roots and threw it to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit. Its branches were broken off; they dried up and were burned.", "13": "Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and waterless land.", "14": "The stem of the vine caught fire; fire burned up its branches and fruit. The branches will never again be strong, will never be royal scepters. This is a song of sorrow; it has been sung again and again."}

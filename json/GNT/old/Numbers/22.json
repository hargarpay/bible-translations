", "6": "They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then perhaps we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse.\u201d", "7": "So the Moabite and Midianite leaders took with them the payment for the curse, went to Balaam, and gave him Balak's message.

Please come and curse these people for me.\u201d", "18": "But Balaam answered, \u201cEven if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not disobey the command of the Lord my God in even the smallest matter.

Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick. ", "28": "Then the Lord gave the donkey the power of speech, and it said to Balaam, \u201cWhat have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?\u201d", "29": "Balaam answered, \u201cBecause you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you.\u201d", "30": "The donkey replied, \u201cAm I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he answered.", "31": "Then the Lord let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword; and Balaam threw himself face downward on the ground. ", "32": "The angel demanded, \u201cWhy have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey.[a] ", "33": "But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it hadn't, I would have killed you and spared the donkey.\u201d", "34": "Balaam replied, \u201cI have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me; but now if you think it is wrong for me to go on, I will return home.\u201d", "35": "But the angel said, \u201cGo on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say.\u201d So Balaam went on with them.", "36": "When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab.

But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say.\u201d ", "39": "So Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth, ", "40": "where Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.", "41": "The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel."}

It has not put its trust in the Lord or asked for his help. ", "3": "Its officials are like roaring lions; its judges are like hungry wolves, too greedy to leave a bone until morning. ", "4": "The prophets are irresponsible and treacherous; the priests defile what is sacred, and twist the law of God to their own advantage. ", "5": "But the Lord is still in the city; he does what is right and never what is wrong. Every morning without fail, he brings justice to his people. And yet the unrighteous people there keep on doing wrong and are not ashamed.", "6": "The Lord says, \u201cI have wiped out whole nations; I have destroyed their cities and left their walls and towers in ruins. The cities are deserted; the streets are empty\u2014no one is left.

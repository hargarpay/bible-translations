The more productive their land was, the more beautiful they made the sacred stone pillars they worship. ", "2": "The people whose hearts are deceitful must now suffer for their sins. God will break down their altars and destroy their sacred pillars.", "3": "These people will soon be saying, \u201cWe have no king because we did not fear the Lord. But what could a king do for us anyway?\u201d ", "4": "They utter empty words and make false promises and useless treaties. Justice has become injustice, growing like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.", "5": "The people who live in the city of Samaria will be afraid and will mourn the loss of the gold bull[a] at Bethaven.[b] They and the priests who serve the idol will weep over it. They will wail when it is stripped of its golden splendor. ", "6": "The idol will be carried off to Assyria as tribute to the great emperor. The people of Israel will be disgraced and put to shame because of the advice they followed. ", "7": "Their king will be carried off, like a chip of wood on water.

It is time for you to turn to me, your Lord, and I will come and pour out blessings upon you.' ", "13": "But instead you planted evil and reaped its harvest.

Listen, Israel, to what he says: \u201cThere is no faithfulness or love in the land, and the people do not acknowledge me as God. ", "2": "They make promises and break them; they lie, murder, steal, and commit adultery. Crimes increase, and there is one murder after another. ", "3": "And so the land will dry up, and everything that lives on it will die. All the animals and birds, and even the fish, will die.\u201d", "4": "The Lord says, \u201cLet no one accuse the people or reprimand them\u2014my complaint is against you priests.[a] ", "5": "Night and day you blunder on, and the prophets do no better than you. I am going to destroy Israel, your mother. ", "6": "My people are doomed because they do not acknowledge me. You priests have refused to acknowledge me and have rejected my teaching, and so I reject you and will not acknowledge your sons as my priests.", "7": "\u201cThe more of you priests there are, the more you sin against me, and so I will turn your honor into disgrace.

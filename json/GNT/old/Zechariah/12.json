He says, ", "2": "\u201cI will make Jerusalem like a cup of wine; the nations around her will drink and stagger like drunks. And when they besiege Jerusalem, the cities of the rest of Judah will also be besieged. ", "3": "But when that time comes, I will make Jerusalem like a heavy stone\u2014any nation that tries to lift it will be hurt. All the nations of the world will join forces to attack her. ", "4": "At that time I will terrify all their horses and make all their riders go crazy. I will watch over the people of Judah, but I will make the horses of their enemies blind. ", "5": "Then the clans of Judah will say to themselves, 'The Lord God Almighty gives strength to his people who live in Jerusalem.'", "6": "\u201cAt that time I will make the clans of Judah like a fire in a forest or in a field of ripe grain\u2014they will destroy all the surrounding nations.

Each family will mourn by itself, and the men of each family will mourn separately from the women."}

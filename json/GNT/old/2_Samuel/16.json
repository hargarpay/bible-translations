{"1": "When David had gone a little beyond the top of the hill, he was suddenly met by Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, who had with him a couple of donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred bunches of fresh fruit, and a leather bag full of wine. ", "2": "King David asked him, \u201cWhat are you going to do with all that?\u201d Ziba answered, \u201cThe donkeys are for Your Majesty's family to ride, the bread and the fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is for them to drink when they get tired in the wilderness.\u201d", "3": "\u201cWhere is Mephibosheth, the grandson of your master Saul?\u201d the king asked him. \u201cHe is staying in Jerusalem,\u201d Ziba answered, \u201cbecause he is convinced that the Israelites will now restore to him the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.\u201d", "4": "The king said to Ziba, \u201cEverything that belonged to Mephibosheth is yours.\u201d \u201cI am your servant,\u201d Ziba replied. \u201cMay I always please Your Majesty!\u201d", "5": "When King David arrived at Bahurim, one of Saul's relatives, Shimei son of Gera, came out to meet him, cursing him as he came. ", "6": "Shimei started throwing stones at David and his officials, even though David was surrounded by his men and his bodyguards. ", "7": "Shimei cursed him and said, \u201cGet out! Get out! Murderer! Criminal! ", "8": "You took Saul's kingdom, and now the Lord is punishing you for murdering so many of Saul's family. The Lord has given the kingdom to your son Absalom, and you are ruined, you murderer!\u201d", "9": "Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, said to the king, \u201cYour Majesty, why do you let this dog curse you? Let me go over there and cut off his head!\u201d", "10": "\u201cThis is none of your business,\u201d the king said to Abishai and his brother Joab. \u201cIf he curses me because the Lord told him to, who has the right to ask why he does it?\u201d ", "11": "And David said to Abishai and to all his officials, \u201cMy own son is trying to kill me; so why should you be surprised at this Benjaminite? The Lord told him to curse; so leave him alone and let him do it. ", "12": "Perhaps the Lord will notice my misery[a] and give me some blessings to take the place of his curse.\u201d ", "13": "So David and his men continued along the road. Shimei kept up with them, walking on the hillside; he was cursing and throwing stones and dirt at them as he went. ", "14": "The king and all his men were worn out when they reached the Jordan,[b] and there they rested.", "15": "Absalom and all the Israelites with him entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with them. ", "16": "When Hushai, David's trusted friend, met Absalom, he shouted, \u201cLong live the king! Long live the king!\u201d", "17": "\u201cWhat has happened to your loyalty to your friend David?\u201d Absalom asked him. \u201cWhy didn't you go with him?\u201d", "18": "Hushai answered, \u201cHow could I? I am for the one chosen by the Lord, by these people, and by all the Israelites. I will stay with you. ", "19": "After all, whom should I serve, if not my master's son? As I served your father, so now I will serve you.\u201d", "20": "Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, \u201cNow that we are here, what do you advise us to do?\u201d", "21": "Ahithophel answered, \u201cGo and have intercourse with your father's concubines whom he left behind to take care of the palace. Then everyone in Israel will know that your father regards you as his enemy, and your followers will be greatly encouraged.\u201d ", "22": "So they set up a tent for Absalom on the palace roof, and in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his father's concubines.", "23": "Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God; both David and Absalom followed it."}

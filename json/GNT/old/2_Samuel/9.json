{"1": "One day David asked, \u201cIs there anyone left of Saul's family? If there is, I would like to show him kindness for Jonathan's sake.\u201d", "2": "There was a servant of Saul's family named Ziba, and he was told to go to David. \u201cAre you Ziba?\u201d the king asked. \u201cAt your service, sir,\u201d he answered.", "3": "The king asked him, \u201cIs there anyone left of Saul's family to whom I can show loyalty and kindness, as I promised God I would?\u201d Ziba answered, \u201cThere is still one of Jonathan's sons. He is crippled.\u201d", "4": "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d the king asked. \u201cAt the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar,\u201d Ziba answered.

David said, \u201cMephibosheth,\u201d and he answered, \u201cAt your service, sir.\u201d", "7": "\u201cDon't be afraid,\u201d David replied. \u201cI will be kind to you for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will give you back all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always be welcome at my table.\u201d", "8": "Mephibosheth bowed again and said, \u201cI am no better than a dead dog, sir! Why should you be so good to me?\u201d", "9": "Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said, \u201cI am giving Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, everything that belonged to Saul and his family.

But Mephibosheth himself will always be a guest at my table.\u201d (Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)", "11": "Ziba answered, \u201cI will do everything Your Majesty commands.\u201d So Mephibosheth ate at the king's[a] table, just like one of the king's sons.

", "7": "At once the Lord God became angry with Uzzah and killed him because of his irreverence.[d] Uzzah died there beside the Covenant Box, ", "8": "and so that place has been called Perez Uzzah[e] ever since. David was furious because the Lord had punished Uzzah in anger.", "9": "Then David was afraid of the Lord and said, \u201cHow can I take the Covenant Box with me now?\u201d ", "10": "So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem; instead, he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath.

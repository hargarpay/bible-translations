He raged against us like fire, destroying everything.", "4": "He aimed his arrows at us like an enemy; He killed all those who were our joy and delight. Here in Jerusalem we felt his burning anger.", "5": "Like an enemy, the Lord has destroyed Israel; He has left her forts and palaces in ruins.

You slaughtered them without mercy on the day of your anger.", "22": "You invited my enemies to hold a carnival of terror all around me, And no one could escape on that day of your anger. They murdered my children, whom I had raised and loved."}

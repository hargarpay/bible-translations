", "2": "He sinned against the Lord, but he was not as bad as his father or his mother Jezebel; he pulled down the image his father had made for the worship of Baal. ", "3": "Yet, like King Jeroboam son of Nebat before him, he led Israel into sin and would not stop.", "4": "King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, and every year he gave as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 sheep. ", "5": "But when King Ahab of Israel died, Mesha rebelled against Israel. ", "6": "At once King Joram left Samaria and gathered all his troops. ", "7": "He sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: \u201cThe king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you join me in war against him?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d King Jehoshaphat replied. \u201cI am at your disposal, and so are my men and my horses. ", "8": "What route shall we take for the attack?\u201d \u201cWe will go the long way through the wilderness of Edom,\u201d Joram answered.", "9": "So King Joram and the kings of Judah and Edom set out. After marching seven days, they ran out of water, and there was none left for the men or the pack animals.

He was Elijah's assistant.\u201d", "12": "\u201cHe is a true prophet,\u201d King Jehoshaphat said. So the three kings went to Elisha.", "13": "\u201cWhy should I help you?\u201d Elisha said to the king of Israel. \u201cGo and consult those prophets that your father and mother consulted.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Joram replied. \u201cIt is the Lord who has put us three kings at the mercy of the king of Moab.\u201d", "14": "Elisha answered, \u201cBy the living Lord, whom I serve, I swear that I would have nothing to do with you if I didn't respect your ally, King Jehoshaphat of Judah.

", "17": "Even though you will not see any rain or wind, this stream bed will be filled with water, and you, your livestock, and your pack animals will have plenty to drink.'\u201d ", "18": "And Elisha continued, \u201cBut this is an easy thing for the Lord to do; he will also give you victory over the Moabites.

The Israelites kept up the pursuit,[a] slaughtering the Moabites ", "25": "and destroying their cities. As they passed by a fertile field, every Israelite would throw a stone on it until finally all the fields were covered; they also stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees. At last only the capital city of Kir Heres[b] was left, and the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.", "26": "When the king of Moab realized that he was losing the battle, he took seven hundred swordsmen with him and tried to force his way through the enemy lines and escape to the king of Syria,[c] but he failed.

The Israelites were terrified[d] and so they drew back from the city and returned to their own country."}

{"1": "The time came for the Lord to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah and Elisha set out from Gilgal, ", "2": "and on the way Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cNow stay here; the Lord has ordered me to go to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha answered, \u201cI swear by my loyalty to the living Lord and to you that I will not leave you.\u201d So they went on to Bethel.", "3": "A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d \u201cYes, I know,\u201d Elisha answered. \u201cBut let's not talk about it.\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cNow stay here; the Lord has ordered me to go to Jericho.\u201d But Elisha answered, \u201cI swear by my loyalty to the living Lord and to you that I will not leave you.\u201d So they went on to Jericho.", "5": "A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, \u201cDo you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d \u201cYes, I know,\u201d Elisha answered. \u201cBut let's not talk about it.\u201d", "6": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cNow stay here; the Lord has ordered me to go to the Jordan River.\u201d But Elisha answered, \u201cI swear by my loyalty to the living Lord and to you that I will not leave you.\u201d So they went on, ", "7": "and fifty of the prophets followed them to the Jordan. Elijah and Elisha stopped by the river, and the fifty prophets stood a short distance away. ", "8": "Then Elijah took off his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it; the water divided, and he and Elisha crossed to the other side on dry ground. ", "9": "There, Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cTell me what you want me to do for you before I am taken away.\u201d \u201cLet me receive the share of your power that will make me your successor,\u201d[a] Elisha answered.", "10": "\u201cThat is a difficult request to grant,\u201d Elijah replied. \u201cBut you will receive it if you see me as I am being taken away from you; if you don't see me, you won't receive it.\u201d", "11": "They kept talking as they walked on; then suddenly a chariot of fire pulled by horses of fire came between them, and Elijah was taken up to heaven by a whirlwind. ", "12": "Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah, \u201cMy father, my father! Mighty defender of Israel! You are gone!\u201d And he never saw Elijah again. In grief Elisha tore his cloak in two. ", "13": "Then he picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. ", "14": "He struck the water with Elijah's cloak and said, \u201cWhere is the Lord, the God of Elijah?\u201d Then he struck the water again, and it divided, and he walked over to the other side. ", "15": "The fifty prophets from Jericho saw him and said, \u201cThe power of Elijah is on Elisha!\u201d They went to meet him, bowed down before him, ", "16": "and said, \u201cThere are fifty of us here, all strong men. Let us go and look for your master. Maybe the spirit of the Lord has carried him away and left him on some mountain or in some valley.\u201d \u201cNo, you must not go,\u201d Elisha answered.", "17": "But they insisted until he gave in and let them go. The fifty of them went and looked high and low for Elijah for three days, but didn't find him.

They brought it to him, ", "21": "and he went to the spring, threw the salt in the water, and said, \u201cThis is what the Lord says: 'I make this water pure, and it will not cause any more deaths or miscarriages.'\u201d ", "22": "And that water has been pure ever since, just as Elisha said it would be.", "23": "Elisha left Jericho to go to Bethel, and on the way some boys came out of a town and made fun of him. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d they shouted.", "24": "Elisha turned around, glared at them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces.", "25": "Elisha went on to Mount Carmel and later returned to Samaria."}

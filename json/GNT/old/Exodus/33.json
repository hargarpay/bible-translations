", "3": "You are going to a rich and fertile land. But I will not go with you myself, because you are a stubborn people, and I might destroy you on the way.\u201d", "4": "When the people heard this, they began to mourn and did not wear jewelry any more. ", "5": "For the Lord had commanded Moses to tell them, \u201cYou are a stubborn people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I would completely destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you.\u201d ", "6": "So after they left Mount Sinai, the people of Israel no longer wore jewelry.", "7": "Whenever the people of Israel set up camp, Moses would take the sacred Tent and put it up some distance outside the camp. It was called the Tent of the Lord's presence, and anyone who wanted to consult the Lord would go out to it. ", "8": "Whenever Moses went out there, the people would stand at the door of their tents and watch Moses until he entered it.

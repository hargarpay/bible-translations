I do not know the Lord; and I will not let Israel go.\u201d", "3": "Moses and Aaron replied, \u201cThe God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us. Allow us to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. If we don't do so, he will kill us with disease or by war.\u201d", "4": "The king said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cWhat do you mean by making the people neglect their work? Get those slaves back to work! ", "5": "You people have become more numerous than the Egyptians. And now you want to stop working!\u201d", "6": "That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave drivers and the Israelite foremen: ", "7": "\u201cStop giving the people straw for making bricks. Make them go and find it for themselves. ", "8": "But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before, not one brick less. They don't have enough work to do, and that is why they keep asking me to let them go and offer sacrifices to their God!

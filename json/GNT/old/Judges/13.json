I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name. ", "7": "But he did tell me that I would become pregnant and have a son. He told me not to drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food, because the boy is to be dedicated to God as a nazirite as long as he lives.\u201d", "8": "Then Manoah prayed to the Lord, \u201cPlease, Lord, let the man of God that you sent come back to us and tell us what we must do with the boy when he is born.\u201d", "9": "God did what Manoah asked, and his angel came back to the woman while she was sitting in the field.

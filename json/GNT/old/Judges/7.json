{"1": "One day Gideon and all his men got up early and camped beside Harod Spring. The Midianite camp was in the valley to the north of them by Moreh Hill.", "2": "The Lord said to Gideon, \u201cThe men you have are too many for me to give them victory over the Midianites. They might think that they had won by themselves, and so give me no credit. ", "3": "Announce to the people, 'Anyone who is afraid should go back home, and we will stay here at Mount Gilead.'\u201d So twenty-two thousand went back, but ten thousand stayed.", "4": "Then the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cYou still have too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will separate them for you there. If I tell you a man should go with you, he will go. If I tell you a man should not go with you, he will not go.\u201d ", "5": "Gideon took the men down to the water, and the Lord told him, \u201cSeparate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue like a dog, from everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.\u201d ", "6": "There were three hundred men who scooped up water in their hands and lapped it; all the others got down on their knees to drink. ", "7": "The Lord said to Gideon, \u201cI will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites with the three hundred men who lapped the water. Tell everyone else to go home.\u201d ", "8": "So Gideon sent all the Israelites home, except the three hundred, who kept all the supplies and trumpets. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.", "9": "That night the Lord commanded Gideon, \u201cGet up and attack the camp; I am giving you victory over it. ", "10": "But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah. ", "11": "You will hear what they are saying, and then you will have the courage to attack.\u201d So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp. ", "12": "The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and they had as many camels as there are grains of sand on the seashore.", "13": "When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling a friend about a dream. He was saying, \u201cI dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into our camp and hit a tent. The tent collapsed and lay flat on the ground.\u201d", "14": "His friend replied, \u201cIt's the sword of the Israelite, Gideon son of Joash! It can't mean anything else! God has given him victory over Midian and our whole army!\u201d", "15": "When Gideon heard about the man's dream and what it meant, he fell to his knees and worshiped the Lord. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and said, \u201cGet up! The Lord is giving you victory over the Midianite army!\u201d ", "16": "He divided his three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside it. ", "17": "He told them, \u201cWhen I get to the edge of the camp, watch me, and do what I do. ", "18": "When my group and I blow our trumpets, then you blow yours all around the camp and shout, 'For the Lord and for Gideon!'\u201d", "19": "Gideon and his one hundred men came to the edge of the camp a while before midnight, just after the guard had been changed. Then they blew the trumpets and broke the jars they were holding, ", "20": "and the other two groups did the same. They all held the torches in their left hands, the trumpets in their right, and shouted, \u201cA sword for the Lord and for Gideon!\u201d ", "21": "Every man stood in his place around the camp, and the whole enemy army ran away yelling. ", "22": "While Gideon's men were blowing their trumpets, the Lord made the enemy troops attack each other with their swords. They ran toward Zarethan as far as Beth Shittah, as far as the town of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.", "23": "Then men from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both parts of Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. ", "24": "Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim to say, \u201cCome down and fight the Midianites. Hold the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah, to keep the Midianites from crossing them.\u201d The men of Ephraim were called together, and they held the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah. ", "25": "They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at Oreb Rock, and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan."}

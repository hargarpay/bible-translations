Loudly and bitterly they mourned: ", "3": "\u201cLord God of Israel, why has this happened? Why is the tribe of Benjamin about to disappear from Israel?\u201d", "4": "Early the next morning the people got up and built an altar there. They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole. ", "5": "They asked, \u201cIs there any group out of all the tribes of Israel that did not go to the gathering in the Lord's presence at Mizpah?\u201d (They had taken a solemn oath that anyone who had not gone to Mizpah would be put to death.) ", "6": "The people of Israel felt sorry for their brothers the Benjaminites and said, \u201cToday Israel has lost one of its tribes.

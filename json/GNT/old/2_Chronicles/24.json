", "5": "He ordered the priests and the Levites to go to the cities of Judah and collect from all the people enough money to make the annual repairs on the Temple. He told them to act promptly, but the Levites delayed, ", "6": "so he called in Jehoiada, their leader, and demanded, \u201cWhy haven't you seen to it that the Levites collect from Judah and Jerusalem the tax which Moses, the servant of the Lord, required the people[a] to pay for support of the Tent of the Lord's presence?\u201d", "7": "(7\u00a0The followers of Athaliah, that corrupt woman,[b] had damaged the Temple and had used many of the sacred objects in the worship of Baal.)", "8": "The king ordered the Levites to make a box for contributions and to place it at the Temple gate.

In those days they did respect and fear me. ", "6": "They taught what was right, not what was wrong. They lived in harmony with me; they not only did what was right themselves, but they also helped many others to stop doing evil. ", "7": "It is the duty of priests to teach the true knowledge of God. People should go to them to learn my will, because they are the messengers of the Lord Almighty.", "8": "\u201cBut now you priests have turned away from the right path.

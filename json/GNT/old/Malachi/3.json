{"1": "The Lord Almighty answers, \u201cI will send my messenger to prepare the way for me. Then the Lord you are looking for will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger you long to see will come and proclaim my covenant.\u201d", "2": "But who will be able to endure the day when he comes? Who will be able to survive when he appears? He will be like strong soap, like a fire that refines metal. ", "3": "He will come to judge like one who refines and purifies silver. As a metalworker refines silver and gold, so the Lord's messenger will purify the priests, so that they will bring to the Lord the right kind of offerings. ", "4": "Then the offerings which the people of Judah and Jerusalem bring to the Lord will be pleasing to him, as they used to be in the past.", "5": "The Lord Almighty says, \u201cI will appear among you to judge, and I will testify at once against those who practice magic, against adulterers, against those who give false testimony, those who cheat employees out of their wages, and those who take advantage of widows, orphans, and foreigners\u2014against all who do not respect me.", "6": "\u201cI am the Lord, and I do not change. And so you, the descendants of Jacob, are not yet completely lost. ", "7": "You, like your ancestors before you, have turned away from my laws and have not kept them. Turn back to me, and I will turn to you. But you ask, 'What must we do to turn back to you?' ", "8": "I ask you, is it right for a person to cheat God? Of course not, yet you are cheating me. 'How?' you ask. In the matter of tithes and offerings. ", "9": "A curse is on all of you because the whole nation is cheating me. ", "10": "Bring the full amount of your tithes to the Temple, so that there will be plenty of food there. Put me to the test and you will see that I will open the windows of heaven and pour out on you in abundance all kinds of good things. ", "11": "I will not let insects destroy your crops, and your grapevines will be loaded with grapes. ", "12": "Then the people of all nations will call you happy, because your land will be a good place to live.", "13": "\u201cYou have said terrible things about me,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cBut you ask, 'What have we said about you?' ", "14": "You have said, 'It's useless to serve God. What's the use of doing what he says or of trying to show the Lord Almighty that we are sorry for what we have done? ", "15": "As we see it, proud people are the ones who are happy. Evil people not only prosper, but they test God's patience with their evil deeds and get away with it.'\u201d", "16": "Then the people who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened and heard what they said. In his presence, there was written down in a book a record of those who feared the Lord and respected him. ", "17": "\u201cThey will be my people,\u201d says the Lord Almighty. \u201cOn the day when I act, they will be my very own. I will be merciful to them as parents are merciful to the children who serve them. ", "18": "Once again my people will see the difference between what happens to the righteous and to the wicked, to the person who serves me and the one who does not.\u201d"}

{"1": "Then Joshua sent two spies from the camp at Acacia with orders to go and secretly explore the land of Canaan, especially the city of Jericho. When they came to the city, they went to spend the night in the house of a prostitute named Rahab. ", "2": "The king of Jericho heard that some Israelites had come that night to spy out the country, ", "3": "so he sent word to Rahab: \u201cThe men in your house have come to spy out the whole country! Bring them out!\u201d", "4-6": "\u201cSome men did come to my house,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut I don't know where they were from. They left at sundown before the city gate was closed. I didn't find out where they were going, but if you start after them quickly, you can catch them.\u201d (Now Rahab had taken the two spies up on the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax that she had put there.) ", "7": "The king's men left the city, and then the gate was shut. They went looking for the Israelite spies as far as the place where the road crosses the Jordan.", "8": "Before the spies settled down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof ", "9": "and said to them, \u201cI know that the Lord has given you this land. Everyone in the country is terrified of you. ", "10": "We have heard how the Lord dried up the Red Sea in front of you when you were leaving Egypt. We have also heard how you killed Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. ", "11": "We were afraid as soon as we heard about it; we have all lost our courage because of you.

Don't let us be killed!\u201d", "14": "The men said to her, \u201cMay God take our lives if we don't do as we say![a] If you do not tell anyone what we have been doing, we promise you that when the Lord gives us this land, we will treat you well.\u201d", "15": "Rahab lived in a house built into the city wall, so she let the men down from the window by a rope.

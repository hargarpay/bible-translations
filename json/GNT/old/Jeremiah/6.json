", "2": "The city of Zion is beautiful, but it will be destroyed; ", "3": "kings will camp there with their armies. They will pitch their tents around the city, and each of them will camp wherever they want. ", "4": "They will say, \u201cPrepare to attack Jerusalem! Get ready! We'll attack at noon!\u201d But then they will say, \u201cIt's too late, the day is almost over, and the evening shadows are growing long. ", "5": "We'll attack by night; we'll destroy the city's fortresses.\u201d", "6": "The Lord Almighty has ordered these kings to cut down trees and build mounds in order to besiege Jerusalem.

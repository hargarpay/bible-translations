", "2": "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the rulers who were supposed to take care of his people: \u201cYou have not taken care of my people; you have scattered them and driven them away. Now I am going to punish you for the evil you have done. ", "3": "I will gather the rest of my people from the countries where I have scattered them, and I will bring them back to their homeland. They will have many children and increase in number. ", "4": "I will appoint rulers to take care of them. My people will no longer be afraid or terrified, and I will not punish them again.[a] I, the Lord, have spoken.\u201d", "5": "The Lord says, \u201cThe time is coming when I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David.

Then they will live in their own land.\u201d", "9": "My heart is crushed, and I am trembling.

I am going to bring disaster on them; the time of their punishment is coming. I, the Lord, have spoken.", "13": "I have seen the sin of Samaria's prophets: they have spoken in the name of Baal and have led my people astray.", "14": "But I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem do even worse: they commit adultery and tell lies; they help people to do wrong, so that no one stops doing what is evil. To me they are all as bad as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.", "15": "\u201cSo then, this is what I, the Lord Almighty, say about the prophets of Jerusalem: I will give them bitter plants to eat and poison to drink, because they have spread ungodliness throughout the land.\u201d", "16": "The Lord Almighty said to the people of Jerusalem, \u201cDo not listen to what the prophets say; they are filling you with false hopes.

I am against the prophets who tell their dreams that are full of lies. They tell these dreams and lead my people astray with their lies and their boasting. I did not send them or order them to go, and they are of no help at all to the people. I, the Lord, have spoken.\u201d", "33": "The Lord said to me, \u201cJeremiah, when one of my people or a prophet or a priest asks you, 'What is the Lord's message?' you are to say, 'You are a burden[b] to the Lord, and he is going to get rid of you.'

The people have perverted the words of their God, the living God, the Lord Almighty. ", "37": "Jeremiah, ask the prophets, 'What answer did the Lord give you? What did the Lord say?' ", "38": "And if they disobey my command and use the words 'the Lord's burden,' then tell them that ", "39": "I will certainly pick them up[c] and throw them far away from me, both them and the city that I gave to them and their ancestors.

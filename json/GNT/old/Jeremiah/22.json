Protect the person who is being cheated from the one who is cheating him. Do not mistreat or oppress aliens, orphans, or widows; and do not kill innocent people in this holy place. ", "4": "If you really do as I have commanded, then David's descendants will continue to be kings. And they, together with their officials and their people, will continue to pass through the gates of this palace in chariots and on horses. ", "5": "But if you do not obey my commands, then I swear to you that this palace will fall into ruins. I, the Lord, have spoken.", "6": "\u201cTo me, Judah's royal palace is as beautiful as the land of Gilead and as the Lebanon Mountains; but I will make it a desolate place where no one lives. ", "7": "I am sending men to destroy it. They will all bring their axes, cut down its beautiful cedar pillars, and throw them into the fire.", "8": "\u201cAfterward many foreigners will pass by and ask one another why I, the Lord, have done such a thing to this great city.

That is what it means to know the Lord.", "17": "But you can only see your selfish interests; you kill the innocent and violently oppress your people. The Lord has spoken.", "18": "So then, the Lord says about Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, \u201cNo one will mourn his death or say, 'How terrible, my friend, how terrible!' No one will weep for him or cry, 'My lord! My king!'", "19": "With the funeral honors of a donkey, he will be dragged away and thrown outside Jerusalem's gates.\u201d", "20": "People of Jerusalem, go to Lebanon and shout, go to the land of Bashan and cry; call out from the mountains of Moab, because all your allies have been defeated.", "21": "The Lord spoke to you when you were prosperous, but you refused to listen.

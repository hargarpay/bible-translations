All this happened because your people sinned against the Lord and disobeyed him. ", "4": "Now, I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free. If you want to go to Babylonia with me, you may do so, and I will take care of you. But if you don't want to go, you don't have to. You have the whole country to choose from, and you may go wherever you wish.\u201d", "5": "When I did not answer,[a] Nebuzaradan said, \u201cGo back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylonia has made governor of the towns of Judah. You may stay with him and live among the people, or you may go anywhere you think you should.\u201d Then he gave me a present and some food to take with me, and let me go on my way.

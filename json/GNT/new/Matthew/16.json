", "2": "But Jesus answered, \u201cWhen the sun is setting, you say, 'We are going to have fine weather, because the sky is red.' ", "3": "And early in the morning you say, 'It is going to rain, because the sky is red and dark.' You can predict the weather by looking at the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs concerning these times![a] ", "4": "How evil and godless are the people of this day! You ask me for a miracle? No! The only miracle you will be given is the miracle of Jonah.\u201d So he left them and went away.", "5": "When the disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake, they forgot to take any bread.

What little faith you have! ", "9": "Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand men? How many baskets did you fill? ", "10": "And what about the seven loaves for the four thousand men? How many baskets did you fill? ", "11": "How is it that you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? Guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d", "12": "Then the disciples understood that he was not warning them to guard themselves from the yeast used in bread but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.", "13": "Jesus went to the territory near the town of Caesarea Philippi, where he asked his disciples, \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d", "14": "\u201cSome say John the Baptist,\u201d they answered. \u201cOthers say Elijah, while others say Jeremiah or some other prophet.\u201d", "15": "\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked them. \u201cWho do you say I am?\u201d", "16": "Simon Peter answered, \u201cYou are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\u201d", "17": "\u201cGood for you, Simon son of John!\u201d answered Jesus. \u201cFor this truth did not come to you from any human being, but it was given to you directly by my Father in heaven.

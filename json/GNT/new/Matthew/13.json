", "3": "He used parables to tell them many things. \u201cOnce there was a man who went out to sow grain. ", "4": "As he scattered the seed in the field, some of it fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. ", "5": "Some of it fell on rocky ground, where there was little soil. The seeds soon sprouted, because the soil wasn't deep. ", "6": "But when the sun came up, it burned the young plants; and because the roots had not grown deep enough, the plants soon dried up. ", "7": "Some of the seed fell among thorn bushes, which grew up and choked the plants. ", "8": "But some seeds fell in good soil, and the plants bore grain: some had one hundred grains, others sixty, and others thirty.\u201d", "9": "And Jesus concluded, \u201cListen, then, if you have ears!\u201d", "10": "Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, \u201cWhy do you use parables when you talk to the people?\u201d", "11": "Jesus answered, \u201cThe knowledge about the secrets of the Kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. ", "12": "For the person who has something will be given more, so that he will have more than enough; but the person who has nothing will have taken away from him even the little he has.

Otherwise, their eyes would see, their ears would hear, their minds would understand, and they would turn to me, says God, and I would heal them.'", "16": "\u201cAs for you, how fortunate you are!

", "22": "The seeds that fell among thorn bushes stand for those who hear the message; but the worries about this life and the love for riches choke the message, and they don't bear fruit. ", "23": "And the seeds sown in the good soil stand for those who hear the message and understand it: they bear fruit, some as much as one hundred, others sixty, and others thirty.\u201d", "24": "Jesus told them another parable: \u201cThe Kingdom of heaven is like this.

", "30": "Let the wheat and the weeds both grow together until harvest. Then I will tell the harvest workers to pull up the weeds first, tie them in bundles and burn them, and then to gather in the wheat and put it in my barn.'\u201d", "31": "Jesus told them another parable: \u201cThe Kingdom of heaven is like this. A man takes a mustard seed and sows it in his field. ", "32": "It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is the biggest of all plants. It becomes a tree, so that birds come and make their nests in its branches.\u201d", "33": "Jesus told them still another parable: \u201cThe Kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour until the whole batch of dough rises.\u201d", "34": "Jesus used parables to tell all these things to the crowds; he would not say a thing to them without using a parable.

Isn't Mary his mother, and aren't James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas his brothers? ", "56": "Aren't all his sisters living here? Where did he get all this?\u201d ", "57": "And so they rejected him.

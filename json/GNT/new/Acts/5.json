", "2": "But with his wife's agreement he kept part of the money for himself and turned the rest over to the apostles. ", "3": "Peter said to him, \u201cAnanias, why did you let Satan take control of you and make you lie to the Holy Spirit by keeping part of the money you received for the property? ", "4": "Before you sold the property, it belonged to you; and after you sold it, the money was yours. Why, then, did you decide to do such a thing? You have not lied to people\u2014you have lied to God!\u201d ", "5": "As soon as Ananias heard this, he fell down dead; and all who heard about it were terrified. ", "6": "The young men came in, wrapped up his body, carried him out, and buried him.", "7": "About three hours later his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. ", "8": "Peter asked her, \u201cTell me, was this the full amount you and your husband received for your property?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, \u201cthe full amount.\u201d", "9": "So Peter said to her, \u201cWhy did you and your husband decide to put the Lord's Spirit to the test? The men who buried your husband are at the door right now, and they will carry you out too!\u201d ", "10": "At once she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

", "28": "\u201cWe gave you strict orders not to teach in the name of this man,\u201d he said; \u201cbut see what you have done! You have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem, and you want to make us responsible for his death!\u201d", "29": "Peter and the other apostles answered, \u201cWe must obey God, not men. ", "30": "The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from death, after you had killed him by nailing him to a cross.

He ordered the apostles to be taken out for a while, ", "35": "and then he said to the Council, \u201cFellow Israelites, be careful what you do to these men.

You could find yourselves fighting against God!\u201d The Council followed Gamaliel's advice. ", "40": "They called the apostles in, had them whipped, and ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus; and then they set them free. ", "41": "As the apostles left the Council, they were happy, because God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of Jesus.

", "8": "I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\u201d", "9": "Not long afterward Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. ", "10": "As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, he saw heaven opening and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove. ", "11": "And a voice came from heaven, \u201cYou are my own dear Son. I am pleased with you.\u201d", "12": "At once the Spirit made him go into the desert, ", "13": "where he stayed forty days, being tempted by Satan.

They were in their boat getting their nets ready. ", "20": "As soon as Jesus saw them, he called them; they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus.", "21": "Jesus and his disciples came to the town of Capernaum, and on the next Sabbath Jesus went to the synagogue and began to teach. ", "22": "The people who heard him were amazed at the way he taught, for he wasn't like the teachers of the Law; instead, he taught with authority.", "23": "Just then a man with an evil spirit came into the synagogue and screamed, ", "24": "\u201cWhat do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth?

But go straight to the priest and let him examine you; then in order to prove to everyone that you are cured, offer the sacrifice that Moses ordered.\u201d", "45": "But the man went away and began to spread the news everywhere. Indeed, he talked so much that Jesus could not go into a town publicly. Instead, he stayed out in lonely places, and people came to him from everywhere."}

{"1": "Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.

You are hypocrites, just as he wrote: 'These people, says God, honor me with their words, but their heart is really far away from me.", "7": "It is no use for them to worship me, because they teach human rules as though they were my laws!'", "8": "\u201cYou put aside God's command and obey human teachings.\u201d", "9": "And Jesus continued, \u201cYou have a clever way of rejecting God's law in order to uphold your own teaching.

Nothing that goes into you from the outside can really make you unclean, ", "19": "because it does not go into your heart but into your stomach and then goes on out of the body.\u201d (In saying this, Jesus declared that all foods are fit to be eaten.)", "20": "And he went on to say, \u201cIt is what comes out of you that makes you unclean.

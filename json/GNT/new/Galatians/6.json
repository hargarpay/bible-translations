And keep an eye on yourselves, so that you will not be tempted, too. ", "2": "Help carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will obey[a] the law of Christ. ", "3": "If you think you are something when you really are nothing, you are only deceiving yourself. ", "4": "You should each judge your own conduct.

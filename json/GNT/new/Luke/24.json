", "4": "They stood there puzzled about this, when suddenly two men in bright shining clothes stood by them. ", "5": "Full of fear, the women bowed down to the ground, as the men said to them, \u201cWhy are you looking among the dead for one who is alive? ", "6": "He is not here; he has been raised. Remember what he said to you while he was in Galilee: ", "7": "'The Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, be crucified, and three days later rise to life.'\u201d", "8": "Then the women remembered his words, ", "9": "returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven disciples and all the rest.

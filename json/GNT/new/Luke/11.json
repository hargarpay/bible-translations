{"1": "One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, \u201cLord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.\u201d", "2": "Jesus said to them, \u201cWhen you pray, say this: 'Father: May your holy name be honored; may your Kingdom come.", "3": "Give us day by day the food we need.[a]", "4": "Forgive us our sins, for we forgive everyone who does us wrong. And do not bring us to hard testing.'\u201d", "5": "And Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cSuppose one of you should go to a friend's house at midnight and say, 'Friend, let me borrow three loaves of bread.

The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' ", "8": "Well, what then? I tell you that even if he will not get up and give you the bread because you are his friend, yet he will get up and give you everything you need because you are not ashamed to keep on asking. ", "9": "And so I say to you: Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. ", "10": "For those who ask will receive, and those who seek will find, and the door will be opened to anyone who knocks. ", "11": "Would any of you who are fathers give your son a snake when he asks for fish? ", "12": "Or would you give him a scorpion when he asks for an egg? ", "13": "As bad as you are, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d", "14": "Jesus was driving out a demon that could not talk; and when the demon went out, the man began to talk. The crowds were amazed, ", "15": "but some of the people said, \u201cIt is Beelzebul, the chief of the demons, who gives him the power to drive them out.\u201d", "16": "Others wanted to trap Jesus, so they asked him to perform a miracle to show that God approved of him. ", "17": "But Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said to them, \u201cAny country that divides itself into groups which fight each other will not last very long; a family divided against itself falls apart. ", "18": "So if Satan's kingdom has groups fighting each other, how can it last? You say that I drive out demons because Beelzebul gives me the power to do so. ", "19": "If this is how I drive them out, how do your followers drive them out? Your own followers prove that you are wrong! ", "20": "No, it is rather by means of God's power that I drive out demons, and this proves that the Kingdom of God has already come to you.", "21": "\u201cWhen a strong man, with all his weapons ready, guards his own house, all his belongings are safe.

Did not God, who made the outside, also make the inside?

You give to God one tenth of the seasoning herbs, such as mint and rue and all the other herbs, but you neglect justice and love for God. These you should practice, without neglecting the others.", "43": "\u201cHow terrible for you Pharisees!

", "49": "For this reason the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and messengers; they will kill some of them and persecute others.'

They will bring in destructive, untrue doctrines, and will deny the Master who redeemed them, and so they will bring upon themselves sudden destruction. ", "2": "Even so, many will follow their immoral ways; and because of what they do, others will speak evil of the Way of truth. ", "3": "In their greed these false teachers will make a profit out of telling you made-up stories. For a long time now their Judge has been ready, and their Destroyer has been wide awake!", "4": "God did not spare the angels who sinned, but threw them into hell, where they are kept chained in darkness,[a] waiting for the Day of Judgment. ", "5": "God did not spare the ancient world, but brought the flood on the world of godless people; the only ones he saved were Noah, who preached righteousness, and seven other people. ", "6": "God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, destroying them with fire, and made them an example of what will happen to the godless. ", "7": "He rescued Lot, a good man, who was distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless people. ", "8": "That good man lived among them, and day after day he suffered agony as he saw and heard their evil actions. ", "9": "And so the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the Day of Judgment, ", "10": "especially those who follow their filthy bodily lusts and despise God's authority. These false teachers are bold and arrogant, and show no respect for the glorious beings above; instead, they insult them. ", "11": "Even the angels, who are so much stronger and mightier than these false teachers, do not accuse them with insults in the presence of the Lord. ", "12": "But these people act by instinct, like wild animals born to be captured and killed; they attack with insults anything they do not understand. They will be destroyed like wild animals, ", "13": "and they will be paid with suffering for the suffering they have caused. Pleasure for them is to do anything in broad daylight that will satisfy their bodily appetites; they are a shame and a disgrace as they join you in your meals, all the while enjoying their deceitful ways! ", "14": "They want to look for nothing but the chance to commit adultery; their appetite for sin is never satisfied. They lead weak people into a trap. Their hearts are trained to be greedy. They are under God's curse!

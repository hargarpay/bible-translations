", "2": "You want things, but you cannot have them, so you are ready to kill; you strongly desire things, but you cannot get them, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have what you want because you do not ask God for it. ", "3": "And when you ask, you do not receive it, because your motives are bad; you ask for things to use for your own pleasures.

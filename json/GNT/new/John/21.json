{"1": "After this, Jesus appeared once more to his disciples at Lake Tiberias. This is how it happened. ", "2": "Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael (the one from Cana in Galilee), the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus were all together. ", "3": "Simon Peter said to the others, \u201cI am going fishing.\u201d \u201cWe will come with you,\u201d they told him. So they went out in a boat, but all that night they did not catch a thing. ", "4": "As the sun was rising, Jesus stood at the water's edge, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. ", "5": "Then he asked them, \u201cYoung men, haven't you caught anything?\u201d \u201cNot a thing,\u201d they answered.", "6": "He said to them, \u201cThrow your net out on the right side of the boat, and you will catch some.\u201d So they threw the net out and could not pull it back in, because they had caught so many fish.", "7": "The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d When Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken his clothes off) and jumped into the water. ", "8": "The other disciples came to shore in the boat, pulling the net full of fish. They were not very far from land, about a hundred yards away. ", "9": "When they stepped ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it and some bread. ", "10": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cBring some of the fish you have just caught.\u201d", "11": "Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore full of big fish, a hundred and fifty-three in all; even though there were so many, still the net did not tear. ", "12": "Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and eat.\u201d None of the disciples dared ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they knew it was the Lord. ", "13": "So Jesus went over, took the bread, and gave it to them; he did the same with the fish.", "14": "This, then, was the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from death.", "15": "After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me more than these others do?\u201d \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d he answered, \u201cyou know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTake care of my lambs.\u201d ", "16": "A second time Jesus said to him, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d he answered, \u201cyou know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTake care of my sheep.\u201d ", "17": "A third time Jesus said, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter became sad because Jesus asked him the third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d and so he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTake care of my sheep. ", "18": "I am telling you the truth: when you were young, you used to get ready and go anywhere you wanted to; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will tie you up and take you where you don't want to go.\u201d ", "19": "(In saying this, Jesus was indicating the way in which Peter would die and bring glory to God.) Then Jesus said to him, \u201cFollow me!\u201d", "20": "Peter turned around and saw behind him that other disciple, whom Jesus loved\u2014the one who had leaned close to Jesus at the meal and had asked, \u201cLord, who is going to betray you?\u201d ", "21": "When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, \u201cLord, what about this man?\u201d", "22": "Jesus answered him, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!\u201d", "23": "So a report spread among the followers of Jesus that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die; he said, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come, what is that to you?\u201d", "24": "He is the disciple who spoke of these things, the one who also wrote them down; and we know that what he said is true.", "25": "Now, there are many other things that Jesus did. If they were all written down one by one, I suppose that the whole world could not hold the books that would be written."}

{"1": "There was a Jewish leader named Nicodemus, who belonged to the party of the Pharisees. ", "2": "One night he went to Jesus and said to him, \u201cRabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent by God. No one could perform the miracles you are doing unless God were with him.\u201d", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cI am telling you the truth: no one can see the Kingdom of God without being born again.\u201d[a]", "4": "\u201cHow can a grown man be born again?\u201d Nicodemus asked. \u201cHe certainly cannot enter his mother's womb and be born a second time!\u201d", "5": "\u201cI am telling you the truth,\u201d replied Jesus, \u201cthat no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit. ", "6": "A person is born physically of human parents, but is born spiritually of the Spirit. ", "7": "Do not be surprised because I tell you that you must all be born again.[b] ", "8": "The wind blows wherever it wishes; you hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. It is like that with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d", "9": "\u201cHow can this be?\u201d asked Nicodemus.", "10": "Jesus answered, \u201cYou are a great teacher in Israel, and you don't know this? ", "11": "I am telling you the truth: we speak of what we know and report what we have seen, yet none of you is willing to accept our message.

", "19": "This is how the judgment works: the light has come into the world, but people love the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds are evil. ", "20": "Those who do evil things hate the light and will not come to the light, because they do not want their evil deeds to be shown up. ", "21": "But those who do what is true come to the light in order that the light may show that what they did was in obedience to God.", "22": "After this, Jesus and his disciples went to the province of Judea, where he spent some time with them and baptized. ", "23": "John also was baptizing in Aenon, not far from Salim, because there was plenty of water in that place. People were going to him, and he was baptizing them.

He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly matters, but he who comes from heaven is above all.

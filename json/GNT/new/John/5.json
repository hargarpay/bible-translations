{"1": "After this, Jesus went to Jerusalem for a religious festival. ", "2": "Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there is a pool[a] with five porches; in Hebrew it is called Bethzatha.[b] ", "3": "A large crowd of sick people were lying on the porches\u2014the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed. ", "4": "[c] ", "5": "A man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. ", "6": "Jesus saw him lying there, and he knew that the man had been sick for such a long time; so he asked him, \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d", "7": "The sick man answered, \u201cSir, I don't have anyone here to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up; while I am trying to get in, somebody else gets there first.\u201d", "8": "Jesus said to him, \u201cGet up, pick up your mat, and walk.\u201d ", "9": "Immediately the man got well; he picked up his mat and started walking. The day this happened was a Sabbath, ", "10": "so the Jewish authorities told the man who had been healed, \u201cThis is a Sabbath, and it is against our Law for you to carry your mat.\u201d", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe man who made me well told me to pick up my mat and walk.\u201d", "12": "They asked him, \u201cWho is the man who told you to do this?\u201d", "13": "But the man who had been healed did not know who Jesus was, for there was a crowd in that place, and Jesus had slipped away.", "14": "Afterward, Jesus found him in the Temple and said, \u201cListen, you are well now; so stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\u201d", "15": "Then the man left and told the Jewish authorities that it was Jesus who had healed him. ", "16": "So they began to persecute Jesus, because he had done this healing on a Sabbath. ", "17": "Jesus answered them, \u201cMy Father is always working, and I too must work.\u201d", "18": "This saying made the Jewish authorities all the more determined to kill him; not only had he broken the Sabbath law, but he had said that God was his own Father and in this way had made himself equal with God.", "19": "So Jesus answered them, \u201cI tell you the truth: the Son can do nothing on his own; he does only what he sees his Father doing. What the Father does, the Son also does. ", "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. He will show him even greater things to do than this, and you will all be amazed. ", "21": "Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, in the same way the Son gives life to those he wants to. ", "22": "Nor does the Father himself judge anyone. He has given his Son the full right to judge, ", "23": "so that all will honor the Son in the same way as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.", "24": "\u201cI am telling you the truth: those who hear my words and believe in him who sent me have eternal life.

", "35": "John was like a lamp, burning and shining, and you were willing for a while to enjoy his light. ", "36": "But I have a witness on my behalf which is even greater than the witness that John gave: what I do, that is, the deeds my Father gave me to do, these speak on my behalf and show that the Father has sent me.

You have never heard his voice or seen his face, ", "38": "and you do not keep his message in your hearts, for you do not believe in the one whom he sent.

", "45": "Do not think, however, that I am the one who will accuse you to my Father. Moses, in whom you have put your hope, is the very one who will accuse you.

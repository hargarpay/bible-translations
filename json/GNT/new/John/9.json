Was it his own or his parents' sin?\u201d", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cHis blindness has nothing to do with his sins or his parents' sins. He is blind so that God's power might be seen at work in him. ", "4": "As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me; night is coming when no one can work. ", "5": "While I am in the world, I am the light for the world.\u201d", "6": "After he said this, Jesus spat on the ground and made some mud with the spittle; he rubbed the mud on the man's eyes ", "7": "and told him, \u201cGo and wash your face in the Pool of Siloam.\u201d (This name means \u201cSent.\u201d) So the man went, washed his face, and came back seeing.", "8": "His neighbors, then, and the people who had seen him begging before this, asked, \u201cIsn't this the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d", "9": "Some said, \u201cHe is the one,\u201d but others said, \u201cNo he isn't; he just looks like him.\u201d So the man himself said, \u201cI am the man.\u201d", "10": "\u201cHow is it that you can now see?\u201d they asked him.", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe man called Jesus made some mud, rubbed it on my eyes, and told me to go to Siloam and wash my face.

He carried the money bag and would help himself from it.", "7": "But Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone! Let her keep what she has for the day of my burial. ", "8": "You will always have poor people with you, but you will not always have me.\u201d", "9": "A large number of people heard that Jesus was in Bethany, so they went there, not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from death.

How, then, can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?\u201d", "35": "Jesus answered, \u201cThe light will be among you a little longer. Continue on your way while you have the light, so that the darkness will not come upon you; for the one who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.

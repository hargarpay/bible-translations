", "5": "Jesus looked around and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, so he asked Philip, \u201cWhere can we buy enough food to feed all these people?\u201d ", "6": "(6\u00a0He said this to test Philip; actually he already knew what he would do.)", "7": "Philip answered, \u201cFor everyone to have even a little, it would take more than two hundred silver coins[a] to buy enough bread.\u201d", "8": "Another one of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said, ", "9": "\u201cThere is a boy here who has five loaves of barley bread and two fish. But they will certainly not be enough for all these people.\u201d", "10": "\u201cMake the people sit down,\u201d Jesus told them. (There was a lot of grass there.) So all the people sat down; there were about five thousand men. ", "11": "Jesus took the bread, gave thanks to God, and distributed it to the people who were sitting there. He did the same with the fish, and they all had as much as they wanted.

Night came on, and Jesus still had not come to them. ", "18": "By then a strong wind was blowing and stirring up the water.

", "27": "Do not work for food that spoils; instead, work for the food that lasts for eternal life. This is the food which the Son of Man will give you, because God, the Father, has put his mark of approval on him.\u201d", "28": "So they asked him, \u201cWhat can we do in order to do what God wants us to do?\u201d", "29": "Jesus answered, \u201cWhat God wants you to do is to believe in the one he sent.\u201d", "30": "They replied, \u201cWhat miracle will you perform so that we may see it and believe you?

If you eat this bread, you will live forever. The bread that I will give you is my flesh, which I give so that the world may live.\u201d", "52": "This started an angry argument among them. \u201cHow can this man give us his flesh to eat?\u201d they asked.", "53": "Jesus said to them, \u201cI am telling you the truth: if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.

Those who eat this bread will live forever.\u201d", "59": "Jesus said this as he taught in the synagogue in Capernaum.", "60": "Many of his followers heard this and said, \u201cThis teaching is too hard. Who can listen to it?\u201d", "61": "Without being told, Jesus knew that they were grumbling about this, so he said to them, \u201cDoes this make you want to give up?

The words I have spoken to you bring God's life-giving Spirit.

You have the words that give eternal life.

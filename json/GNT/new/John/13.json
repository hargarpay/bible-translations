", "4": "So he rose from the table, took off his outer garment, and tied a towel around his waist. ", "5": "Then he poured some water into a washbasin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist. ", "6": "He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \u201cAre you going to wash my feet, Lord?\u201d", "7": "Jesus answered him, \u201cYou do not understand now what I am doing, but you will understand later.\u201d", "8": "Peter declared, \u201cNever at any time will you wash my feet!\u201d \u201cIf I do not wash your feet,\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cyou will no longer be my disciple.\u201d", "9": "Simon Peter answered, \u201cLord, do not wash only my feet, then! Wash my hands and head, too!\u201d", "10": "Jesus said, \u201cThose who have taken a bath are completely clean and do not have to wash themselves, except for their feet.[b] All of you are clean\u2014all except one.\u201d ", "11": "(11\u00a0Jesus already knew who was going to betray him; that is why he said, \u201cAll of you, except one, are clean.\u201d)", "12": "After Jesus had washed their feet, he put his outer garment back on and returned to his place at the table. \u201cDo you understand what I have just done to you?\u201d he asked.

Jesus said to him, \u201cHurry and do what you must!\u201d ", "28": "None of the others at the table understood why Jesus said this to him.

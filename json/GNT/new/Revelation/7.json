{"1": "After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds so that no wind should blow on the earth or the sea or against any tree. ", "2": "And I saw another angel coming up from the east with the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given the power to damage the earth and the sea. ", "3": "The angel said, \u201cDo not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees, until we mark the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.\u201d ", "4": "And I was told that the number of those who were marked with God's seal on their foreheads was 144,000. They were from the twelve tribes of Israel, ", "5-8": "twelve thousand from each tribe: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin.", "9": "After this I looked, and there was an enormous crowd\u2014no one could count all the people! They were from every race, tribe, nation, and language, and they stood in front of the throne and of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands. ", "10": "They called out in a loud voice: \u201cSalvation comes from our God, who sits on the throne, and from the Lamb!\u201d ", "11": "All the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures. Then they threw themselves face downward in front of the throne and worshiped God, ", "12": "saying, \u201cAmen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!\u201d", "13": "One of the elders asked me, \u201cWho are these people dressed in white robes, and where do they come from?\u201d", "14": "\u201cI don't know, sir. You do,\u201d I answered. He said to me, \u201cThese are the people who have come safely through the terrible persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. ", "15": "That is why they stand before God's throne and serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will protect them with his presence. ", "16": "Never again will they hunger or thirst; neither sun nor any scorching heat will burn them, ", "17": "because the Lamb, who is in the center of the throne, will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of life-giving water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.\u201d"}

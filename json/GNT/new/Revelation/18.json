Great Babylon has fallen! She is now haunted by demons and unclean spirits; all kinds of filthy and hateful birds live in her.

Come out from her! You must not take part in her sins; you must not share in her punishment!", "5": "For her sins are piled up as high as heaven, and God remembers her wicked ways.", "6": "Treat her exactly as she has treated you; pay her back double for all she has done. Fill her cup with a drink twice as strong as the drink she prepared for you.", "7": "Give her as much suffering and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself.

", "14": "The merchants say to her, \u201cAll the good things you longed to own have disappeared, and all your wealth and glamor are gone, and you will never find them again!\u201d ", "15": "The merchants, who became rich from doing business in that city, will stand a long way off, because they are afraid of sharing in her suffering. They will cry and mourn, ", "16": "and say, \u201cHow terrible! How awful for the great city! She used to dress herself in linen, purple, and scarlet, and cover herself with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls!

No workman in any trade will ever be found in you again; and the sound of the millstone will be heard no more!

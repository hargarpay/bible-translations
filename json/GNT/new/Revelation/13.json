", "2": "The beast looked like a leopard, with feet like a bear's feet and a mouth like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave the beast his own power, his throne, and his vast authority. ", "3": "One of the heads of the beast seemed to have been fatally wounded, but the wound had healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast. ", "4": "Everyone worshiped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast. They worshiped the beast also, saying, \u201cWho is like the beast? Who can fight against it?\u201d", "5": "The beast was allowed to make proud claims which were insulting to God, and it was permitted to have authority for forty-two months. ", "6": "It began to curse God, his name, the place where he lives, and all those who live in heaven. ", "7": "It was allowed to fight against God's people and to defeat them, and it was given authority over every tribe, nation, language, and race.

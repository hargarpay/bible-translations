", "4": "While we live in this earthly tent, we groan with a feeling of oppression; it is not that we want to get rid of our earthly body, but that we want to have the heavenly one put on over us, so that what is mortal will be transformed by life. ", "5": "God is the one who has prepared us for this change, and he gave us his Spirit as the guarantee of all that he has in store for us.", "6": "So we are always full of courage. We know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord's home. ", "7": "For our life is a matter of faith, not of sight.

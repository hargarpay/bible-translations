", "5": "For I hear of your love for all of God's people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus. ", "6": "My prayer is that our fellowship with you as believers will bring about a deeper understanding of every blessing which we have in our life in union with Christ. ", "7": "Your love, dear brother, has brought me great joy and much encouragement! You have cheered the hearts of all of God's people.", "8": "For this reason I could be bold enough, as your brother in Christ, to order you to do what should be done. ", "9": "But because I love you, I make a request instead. I do this even though I am Paul, the ambassador of Christ Jesus, and at present also a prisoner for his sake.[a] ", "10": "So I make a request to you on behalf of Onesimus, who is my own son in Christ; for while in prison I have become his spiritual father.

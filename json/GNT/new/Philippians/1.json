{"1": "From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus\u2014 To all God's people in Philippi who are in union with Christ Jesus, including the church leaders and helpers:", "2": "May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.", "3": "I thank my God for you every time I think of you; ", "4": "and every time I pray for you all, I pray with joy ", "5": "because of the way in which you have helped me in the work of the gospel from the very first day until now. ", "6": "And so I am sure that God, who began this good work in you, will carry it on until it is finished on the Day of Christ Jesus. ", "7": "You are always in my heart! And so it is only right for me to feel as I do about you. For you have all shared with me in this privilege that God has given me, both now that I am in prison and also while I was free to defend the gospel and establish it firmly. ", "8": "God is my witness that I tell the truth when I say that my deep feeling for you all comes from the heart of Christ Jesus himself.", "9": "I pray that your love will keep on growing more and more, together with true knowledge and perfect judgment, ", "10": "so that you will be able to choose what is best.

", "14": "And my being in prison has given most of the believers more confidence in the Lord, so that they grow bolder all the time to preach the message[a] fearlessly.", "15": "Of course some of them preach Christ because they are jealous and quarrelsome, but others from genuine good will. ", "16": "These do so from love, because they know that God has given me the work of defending the gospel. ", "17": "The others do not proclaim Christ sincerely, but from a spirit of selfish ambition; they think that they will make more trouble for me while I am in prison.", "18": "It does not matter! I am happy about it\u2014just so Christ is preached in every way possible, whether from wrong or right motives. And I will continue to be happy, ", "19": "because I know that by means of your prayers and the help which comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ I shall be set free. ", "20": "My deep desire and hope is that I shall never fail in my duty, but that at all times, and especially right now, I shall be full of courage, so that with my whole being I shall bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die.

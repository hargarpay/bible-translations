", "2": "I can assure you that they are deeply devoted to God; but their devotion is not based on true knowledge. ", "3": "They have not known the way in which God puts people right with himself, and instead, they have tried to set up their own way; and so they did not submit themselves to God's way of putting people right. ", "4": "For Christ has brought the Law to an end, so that everyone who believes is put right with God.", "5": "Moses wrote this about being put right with God by obeying the Law: \u201cWhoever obeys the commands of the Law will live.\u201d ", "6": "But what the scripture says about being put right with God through faith is this: \u201cYou are not to ask yourself, Who will go up into heaven?\u201d (that is, to bring Christ down). ", "7": "\u201cNor are you to ask, Who will go down into the world below?\u201d (that is, to bring Christ up from death). ", "8": "What it says is this: \u201cGod's message is near you, on your lips and in your heart\u201d\u2014that is, the message of faith that we preach.

Moses himself is the first one to answer: \u201cI will use a so-called nation to make my people jealous; and by means of a nation of fools I will make my people angry.\u201d", "20": "And Isaiah is even bolder when he says, \u201cI was found by those who were not looking for me; I appeared to those who were not asking for me.\u201d", "21": "But concerning Israel he says, \u201cAll day long I held out my hands to welcome a disobedient and rebellious people.\u201d"}

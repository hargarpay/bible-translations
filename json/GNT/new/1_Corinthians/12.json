{"1": "Now, concerning what you wrote about the gifts from the Holy Spirit. I want you to know the truth about them, my friends. ", "2": "You know that while you were still heathen, you were led astray in many ways to the worship of lifeless idols. ", "3": "I want you to know that no one who is led by God's Spirit can say \u201cA curse on Jesus!\u201d and no one can confess \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d without being guided by the Holy Spirit.", "4": "There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit gives them. ", "5": "There are different ways of serving, but the same Lord is served. ", "6": "There are different abilities to perform service, but the same God gives ability to all for their particular service.

", "8": "The Spirit gives one person a message full of wisdom, while to another person the same Spirit gives a message full of knowledge. ", "9": "One and the same Spirit gives faith to one person, while to another person he gives the power to heal. ", "10": "The Spirit gives one person the power to work miracles; to another, the gift of speaking God's message; and to yet another, the ability to tell the difference between gifts that come from the Spirit and those that do not. To one person he gives the ability to speak in strange tongues, and to another he gives the ability to explain what is said. ", "11": "But it is one and the same Spirit who does all this; as he wishes, he gives a different gift to each person.", "12": "Christ is like a single body, which has many parts; it is still one body, even though it is made up of different parts. ", "13": "In the same way, all of us, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or free, have been baptized into the one body by the same Spirit, and we have all been given the one Spirit to drink.", "14": "For the body itself is not made up of only one part, but of many parts. ", "15": "If the foot were to say, \u201cBecause I am not a hand, I don't belong to the body,\u201d that would not keep it from being a part of the body.

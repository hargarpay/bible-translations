", "3": "You have spent enough time in the past doing what the heathen like to do. Your lives were spent in indecency, lust, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and the disgusting worship of idols. ", "4": "And now the heathen are surprised when you do not join them in the same wild and reckless living, and so they insult you. ", "5": "But they will have to give an account of themselves to God, who is ready to judge the living and the dead. ", "6": "That is why the Good News was preached also to the dead, to those who had been judged in their physical existence as everyone is judged; it was preached to them so that in their spiritual existence they may live as God lives.", "7": "The end of all things is near. You must be self-controlled and alert, to be able to pray. ", "8": "Above everything, love one another earnestly, because love covers over many sins.

If it starts with us, how will it end with those who do not believe the Good News from God?

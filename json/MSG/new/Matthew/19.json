{"1-2": "When Jesus had completed these teachings, he left Galilee and crossed the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Great crowds followed him there, and he healed them.", "3": "One day the Pharisees were badgering him: \u201cIs it legal for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?\u201d", "4-6": "He answered, \u201cHaven't you read in your Bible that the Creator originally made man and woman for each other, male and female? And because of this, a man leaves father and mother and is firmly bonded to his wife, becoming one flesh\u2014no longer two bodies but one. Because God created this organic union of the two sexes, no one should desecrate his art by cutting them apart.\u201d", "7": "They shot back in rebuttal, \u201cIf that's so, why did Moses give instructions for divorce papers and divorce procedures?\u201d", "8-9": "Jesus said, \u201cMoses provided for divorce as a concession to your hard heartedness, but it is not part of God's original plan. I'm holding you to the original plan, and holding you liable for adultery if you divorce your faithful wife and then marry someone else. I make an exception in cases where the spouse has committed adultery.\u201d", "10": "Jesus' disciples objected, \u201cIf those are the terms of marriage, we're stuck. Why get married?\u201d", "11-12": "But Jesus said, \u201cNot everyone is mature enough to live a married life. It requires a certain aptitude and grace. Marriage isn't for everyone. Some, from birth seemingly, never give marriage a thought. Others never get asked\u2014or accepted. And some decide not to get married for kingdom reasons. But if you're capable of growing into the largeness of marriage, do it.\u201d", "13-15": "One day children were brought to Jesus in the hope that he would lay hands on them and pray over them. The disciples shooed them off. But Jesus intervened: \u201cLet the children alone, don't prevent them from coming to me. God's kingdom is made up of people like these.\u201d After laying hands on them, he left.", "16": "Another day, a man stopped Jesus and asked, \u201cTeacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?\u201d", "17": "Jesus said, \u201cWhy do you question me about what's good? God is the One who is good. If you want to enter the life of God, just do what he tells you.\u201d", "18-19": "The man asked, \u201cWhat in particular?\u201d Jesus said, \u201cDon't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't lie, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you do yourself.\u201d", "20": "The young man said, \u201cI've done all that. What's left?\u201d", "21": "\u201cIf you want to give it all you've got,\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cgo sell your possessions; give everything to the poor. All your wealth will then be in heaven. Then come follow me.\u201d", "22": "That was the last thing the young man expected to hear. And so, crestfallen, he walked away. He was holding on tight to a lot of things, and he couldn't bear to let go.", "23-24": "As he watched him go, Jesus told his disciples, \u201cDo you have any idea how difficult it is for the rich to enter God's kingdom? Let me tell you, it's easier to gallop a camel through a needle's eye than for the rich to enter God's kingdom.\u201d", "25": "The disciples were staggered. \u201cThen who has any chance at all?\u201d", "26": "Jesus looked hard at them and said, \u201cNo chance at all if you think you can pull it off yourself. Every chance in the world if you trust God to do it.\u201d", "27": "Then Peter chimed in, \u201cWe left everything and followed you. What do we get out of it?\u201d", "28-30": "Jesus replied, \u201cYes, you have followed me. In the re-creation of the world, when the Son of Man will rule gloriously, you who have followed me will also rule, starting with the twelve tribes of Israel. And not only you, but anyone who sacrifices home, family, fields\u2014whatever\u2014because of me will get it all back a hundred times over, not to mention the considerable bonus of eternal life. This is the Great Reversal: many of the first ending up last, and the last first.\u201d"}

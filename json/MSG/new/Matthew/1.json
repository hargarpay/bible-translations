His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. Before they came to the marriage bed, Joseph discovered she was pregnant. (It was by the Holy Spirit, but he didn't know that.) Joseph, chagrined but noble, determined to take care of things quietly so Mary would not be disgraced.", "20-23": "While he was trying to figure a way out, he had a dream. God's angel spoke in the dream: \u201cJoseph, son of David, don't hesitate to get married. Mary's pregnancy is Spirit-conceived. God's Holy Spirit has made her pregnant. She will bring a son to birth, and when she does, you, Joseph, will name him Jesus\u2014'God saves'\u2014because he will save his people from their sins.\u201d This would bring the prophet's embryonic sermon to full term: Watch for this\u2014a virgin will get pregnant and bear a son; They will name him Immanuel (Hebrew for \u201cGod is with us\u201d).", "24-25": "Then Joseph woke up. He did exactly what God's angel commanded in the dream: He married Mary. But he did not consummate the marriage until she had the baby. He named the baby Jesus."}

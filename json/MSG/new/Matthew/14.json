That's why he's able to work miracles!\u201d", "3-5": "Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and sent him to prison to placate Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.

Herodias's daughter provided the entertainment, dancing for the guests. She swept Herod away. In his drunken enthusiasm, he promised her on oath anything she wanted. Already coached by her mother, she was ready: \u201cGive me, served up on a platter, the head of John the Baptizer.\u201d That sobered the king up fast. Unwilling to lose face with his guests, he did it\u2014ordered John's head cut off and presented to the girl on a platter. She in turn gave it to her mother. Later, John's disciples got the body, gave it a reverent burial, and reported to Jesus.", "13-14": "When Jesus got the news, he slipped away by boat to an out-of-the-way place by himself. But unsuccessfully\u2014someone saw him and the word got around. Soon a lot of people from the nearby villages walked around the lake to where he was. When he saw them coming, he was overcome with pity and healed their sick.", "15": "Toward evening the disciples approached him. \u201cWe're out in the country and it's getting late.

You give them supper.\u201d", "17": "\u201cAll we have are five loaves of bread and two fish,\u201d they said.", "18-21": "Jesus said, \u201cBring them here.\u201d Then he had the people sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, lifted his face to heaven in prayer, blessed, broke, and gave the bread to the disciples. The disciples then gave the food to the congregation. They all ate their fill. They gathered twelve baskets of leftovers. About five thousand were fed.", "22-23": "As soon as the meal was finished, he insisted that the disciples get in the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he dismissed the people. With the crowd dispersed, he climbed the mountain so he could be by himself and pray. He stayed there alone, late into the night.", "24-26": "Meanwhile, the boat was far out to sea when the wind came up against them and they were battered by the waves. At about four o'clock in the morning, Jesus came toward them walking on the water.

The disciples in the boat, having watched the whole thing, worshiped Jesus, saying, \u201cThis is it! You are God's Son for sure!\u201d", "34-36": "On return, they beached the boat at Gennesaret.

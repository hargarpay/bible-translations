{"1-3": "After this, Jesus appeared again to the disciples, this time at the Tiberias Sea (the Sea of Galilee). This is how he did it: Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed \u201cTwin\u201d), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the brothers Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. Simon Peter announced, \u201cI'm going fishing.\u201d", "3-4": "The rest of them replied, \u201cWe're going with you.\u201d They went out and got in the boat. They caught nothing that night. When the sun came up, Jesus was standing on the beach, but they didn't recognize him.", "5": "Jesus spoke to them: \u201cGood morning! Did you catch anything for breakfast?\u201d They answered, \u201cNo.\u201d", "6": "He said, \u201cThrow the net off the right side of the boat and see what happens.\u201d They did what he said. All of a sudden there were so many fish in it, they weren't strong enough to pull it in.", "7-9": "Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt's the Master!\u201d When Simon Peter realized that it was the Master, he threw on some clothes, for he was stripped for work, and dove into the sea. The other disciples came in by boat for they weren't far from land, a hundred yards or so, pulling along the net full of fish. When they got out of the boat, they saw a fire laid, with fish and bread cooking on it.", "10-11": "Jesus said, \u201cBring some of the fish you've just caught.\u201d Simon Peter joined them and pulled the net to shore\u2014153 big fish! And even with all those fish, the net didn't rip.", "12": "Jesus said, \u201cBreakfast is ready.\u201d Not one of the disciples dared ask, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Master.", "13-14": "Jesus then took the bread and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish. This was now the third time Jesus had shown himself alive to the disciples since being raised from the dead.", "15": "After breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me more than these?\u201d \u201cYes, Master, you know I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d", "16": "He then asked a second time, \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me?\u201d \u201cYes, Master, you know I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cShepherd my sheep.\u201d", "17-19": "Then he said it a third time: \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter was upset that he asked for the third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d so he answered, \u201cMaster, you know everything there is to know. You've got to know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cFeed my sheep. I'm telling you the very truth now: When you were young you dressed yourself and went wherever you wished, but when you get old you'll have to stretch out your hands while someone else dresses you and takes you where you don't want to go.\u201d He said this to hint at the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. And then he commanded, \u201cFollow me.\u201d", "20-21": "Turning his head, Peter noticed the disciple Jesus loved following right behind. When Peter noticed him, he asked Jesus, \u201cMaster, what's going to happen to him?\u201d", "22-23": "Jesus said, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come again, what's that to you? You\u2014follow me.\u201d That is how the rumor got out among the brothers that this disciple wouldn't die. But that is not what Jesus said. He simply said, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come again, what's that to you?\u201d", "24": "This is the same disciple who was eyewitness to all these things and wrote them down. And we all know that his eyewitness account is reliable and accurate.", "25": "There are so many other things Jesus did. If they were all written down, each of them, one by one, I can't imagine a world big enough to hold such a library of books."}

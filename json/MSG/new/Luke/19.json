{"1-4": "Then Jesus entered and walked through Jericho. There was a man there, his name Zacchaeus, the head tax man and quite rich. He wanted desperately to see Jesus, but the crowd was in his way\u2014he was a short man and couldn't see over the crowd. So he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree so he could see Jesus when he came by.", "5-7": "When Jesus got to the tree, he looked up and said, \u201cZacchaeus, hurry down. Today is my day to be a guest in your home.\u201d Zacchaeus scrambled out of the tree, hardly believing his good luck, delighted to take Jesus home with him. Everyone who saw the incident was indignant and grumped, \u201cWhat business does he have getting cozy with this crook?\u201d", "8": "Zacchaeus just stood there, a little stunned. He stammered apologetically, \u201cMaster, I give away half my income to the poor\u2014and if I'm caught cheating, I pay four times the damages.\u201d", "9-10": "Jesus said, \u201cToday is salvation day in this home! Here he is: Zacchaeus, son of Abraham! For the Son of Man came to find and restore the lost.\u201d", "11": "While he had their attention, and because they were getting close to Jerusalem by this time and expectation was building that God's kingdom would appear any minute, he told this story:", "12-13": "\u201cThere was once a man descended from a royal house who needed to make a long trip back to headquarters to get authorization for his rule and then return. But first he called ten servants together, gave them each a sum of money, and instructed them, 'Operate with this until I return.'", "14": "\u201cBut the citizens there hated him. So they sent a commission with a signed petition to oppose his rule: 'We don't want this man to rule us.'", "15": "\u201cWhen he came back bringing the authorization of his rule, he called those ten servants to whom he had given the money to find out how they had done.", "16": "\u201cThe first said, 'Master, I doubled your money.'", "17": "\u201cHe said, 'Good servant! Great work! Because you've been trustworthy in this small job, I'm making you governor of ten towns.'", "18": "\u201cThe second said, 'Master, I made a fifty percent profit on your money.'", "19": "\u201cHe said, 'I'm putting you in charge of five towns.'", "20-21": "\u201cThe next servant said, 'Master, here's your money safe and sound. I kept it hidden in the cellar. To tell you the truth, I was a little afraid. I know you have high standards and hate sloppiness, and don't suffer fools gladly.'", "22-23": "\u201cHe said, 'You're right that I don't suffer fools gladly\u2014and you've acted the fool! Why didn't you at least invest the money in securities so I would have gotten a little interest on it?'", "24": "\u201cThen he said to those standing there, 'Take the money from him and give it to the servant who doubled my stake.'", "25": "\u201cThey said, 'But Master, he already has double\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.'", "26": "\u201cHe said, 'That's what I mean: Risk your life and get more than you ever dreamed of. Play it safe and end up holding the bag.", "27": "\u201c'As for these enemies of mine who petitioned against my rule, clear them out of here. I don't want to see their faces around here again.'\u201d", "28-31": "After saying these things, Jesus headed straight up to Jerusalem. When he got near Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called Olives, he sent off two of the disciples with instructions: \u201cGo to the village across from you. As soon as you enter, you'll find a colt tethered, one that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it. If anyone says anything, asks, 'What are you doing?' say, 'His Master needs him.'\u201d", "32-33": "The two left and found it just as he said. As they were untying the colt, its owners said, \u201cWhat are you doing untying the colt?\u201d", "34": "They said, \u201cHis Master needs him.\u201d", "35-36": "They brought the colt to Jesus. Then, throwing their coats on its back, they helped Jesus get on. As he rode, the people gave him a grand welcome, throwing their coats on the street.", "37-38": "Right at the crest, where Mount Olives begins its descent, the whole crowd of disciples burst into enthusiastic praise over all the mighty works they had witnessed: Blessed is he who comes, the king in God's name! All's well in heaven! Glory in the high places!", "39": "Some Pharisees from the crowd told him, \u201cTeacher, get your disciples under control!\u201d", "40": "But he said, \u201cIf they kept quiet, the stones would do it for them, shouting praise.\u201d", "41-44": "When the city came into view, he wept over it. \u201cIf you had only recognized this day, and everything that was good for you! But now it's too late. In the days ahead your enemies are going to bring up their heavy artillery and surround you, pressing in from every side. They'll smash you and your babies on the pavement. Not one stone will be left intact. All this because you didn't recognize and welcome God's personal visit.\u201d", "45-46": "Going into the Temple he began to throw out everyone who had set up shop, selling everything and anything. He said, \u201cIt's written in Scripture, My house is a house of prayer; You have turned it into a religious bazaar.\u201d", "47-48": "From then on he taught each day in the Temple. The high priests, religion scholars, and the leaders of the people were trying their best to find a way to get rid of him. But with the people hanging on every word he spoke, they couldn't come up with anything."}

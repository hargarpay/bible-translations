No one can put a hand on you. All the same, the great triumph is not in your authority over evil, but in God's authority over you and presence with you. Not what you do for God but what God does for you\u2014that's the agenda for rejoicing.\u201d", "21": "At that, Jesus rejoiced, exuberant in the Holy Spirit. \u201cI thank you, Father, Master of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the know-it-alls and showed them to these innocent newcomers.

On the way he was attacked by robbers. They took his clothes, beat him up, and went off leaving him half-dead.

Later, she stepped in, interrupting them. \u201cMaster, don't you care that my sister has abandoned the kitchen to me? Tell her to lend me a hand.\u201d", "41-42": "The Master said, \u201cMartha, dear Martha, you're fussing far too much and getting yourself worked up over nothing.

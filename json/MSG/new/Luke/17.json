If you see your friend going wrong, correct him. If he responds, forgive him.

Would you take his coat, set the table, and say, 'Sit down and eat'? Wouldn't you be more likely to say, 'Prepare dinner; change your clothes and wait table for me until I've finished my coffee; then go to the kitchen and have your supper'? Does the servant get special thanks for doing what's expected of him? It's the same with you. When you've done everything expected of you, be matter-of-fact and say, 'The work is done. What we were told to do, we did.'\u201d", "11-13": "It happened that as he made his way toward Jerusalem, he crossed over the border between Samaria and Galilee.

Because God's kingdom is already among you.\u201d", "22-24": "He went on to say to his disciples, \u201cThe days are coming when you are going to be desperately homesick for just a glimpse of one of the days of the Son of Man, and you won't see a thing. And they'll say to you, 'Look over there!' or, 'Look here!' Don't fall for any of that nonsense. The arrival of the Son of Man is not something you go out to see.

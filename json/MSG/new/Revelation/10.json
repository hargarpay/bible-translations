{"1-4": "I saw another powerful Angel coming down out of Heaven wrapped in a cloud. There was a rainbow over his head, his face was sun-radiant, his legs pillars of fire. He had a small book open in his hand. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on land, then called out thunderously, a lion roar. When he called out, the Seven Thunders called back. When the Seven Thunders spoke, I started to write it all down, but a voice out of Heaven stopped me, saying, \u201cSeal with silence the Seven Thunders; don't write a word.\u201d", "5-7": "Then the Angel I saw astride sea and land lifted his right hand to Heaven and swore by the One Living Forever and Ever, who created Heaven and everything in it, earth and everything in it, sea and everything in it, that time was up\u2014that when the seventh Angel blew his trumpet, which he was about to do, the Mystery of God, all the plans he had revealed to his servants, the prophets, would be completed.", "8-11": "The voice out of Heaven spoke to me again: \u201cGo, take the book held open in the hand of the Angel astride sea and earth.\u201d I went up to the Angel and said, \u201cGive me the little book.\u201d He said, \u201cTake it, then eat it. It will taste sweet like honey, but turn sour in your stomach.\u201d I took the little book from the Angel's hand and it was sweet honey in my mouth, but when I swallowed, my stomach curdled. Then I was told, \u201cYou must go back and prophesy again over many peoples and nations and languages and kings.\u201d"}

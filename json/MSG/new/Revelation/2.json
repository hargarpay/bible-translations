I know you can't stomach evil, that you weed out apostolic pretenders. I know your persistence, your courage in my cause, that you never wear out.", "4-5": "\u201cBut you walked away from your first love\u2014why? What's going on with you, anyway? Do you have any idea how far you've fallen? A Lucifer fall! \u201cTurn back! Recover your dear early love. No time to waste, for I'm well on my way to removing your light from the golden circle.", "6": "\u201cYou do have this to your credit: You hate the Nicolaitan business. I hate it, too.", "7": "\u201cAre your ears awake? Listen. Listen to the Wind Words, the Spirit blowing through the churches. I'm about to call each conqueror to dinner.

Fear nothing! The Devil is about to throw you in jail for a time of testing\u2014ten days. It won't last forever. \u201cDon't quit, even if it costs you your life. Stay there believing.

But you continue boldly in my Name; you never once denied my Name, even when the pressure was worst, when they martyred Antipas, my witness who stayed faithful to me on Satan's turf.", "14-15": "\u201cBut why do you indulge that Balaam crowd? Don't you remember that Balaam was an enemy agent, seducing Balak and sabotaging Israel's holy pilgrimage by throwing unholy parties?

I gave her a chance to change her ways, but she has no intention of giving up a career in the god-business. I'm about to lay her low, along with her partners, as they play their sex-and-religion games. The bastard offspring of their idol-whoring I'll kill. Then every church will know that appearances don't impress me. I x-ray every motive and make sure you get what's coming to you.", "24-25": "\u201cThe rest of you Thyatirans, who have nothing to do with this outrage, who scorn this playing around with the Devil that gets paraded as profundity, be assured I'll not make life any harder for you than it already is.

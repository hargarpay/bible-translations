He taught by using stories, many stories.", "3-8": "\u201cListen. What do you make of this? A farmer planted seed. As he scattered the seed, some of it fell on the road and birds ate it. Some fell in the gravel; it sprouted quickly but didn't put down roots, so when the sun came up it withered just as quickly. Some fell in the weeds; as it came up, it was strangled among the weeds and nothing came of it. Some fell on good earth and came up with a flourish, producing a harvest exceeding his wildest dreams.", "9": "\u201cAre you listening to this?

He told them, \u201cYou've been given insight into God's kingdom\u2014you know how it works. But to those who can't see it yet, everything comes in stories, creating readiness, nudging them toward receptive insight. These are people\u2014 Whose eyes are open but don't see a thing, Whose ears are open but don't understand a word, Who avoid making an about-face and getting forgiven.\u201d", "13": "He continued, \u201cDo you see how this story works? All my stories work this way.", "14-15": "\u201cThe farmer plants the Word. Some people are like the seed that falls on the hardened soil of the road. No sooner do they hear the Word than Satan snatches away what has been planted in them.", "16-17": "\u201cAnd some are like the seed that lands in the gravel. When they first hear the Word, they respond with great enthusiasm. But there is such shallow soil of character that when the emotions wear off and some difficulty arrives, there is nothing to show for it.", "18-19": "\u201cThe seed cast in the weeds represents the ones who hear the kingdom news but are overwhelmed with worries about all the things they have to do and all the things they want to get. The stress strangles what they heard, and nothing comes of it.", "20": "\u201cBut the seed planted in the good earth represents those who hear the Word, embrace it, and produce a harvest beyond their wildest dreams.\u201d", "21-22": "Jesus went on: \u201cDoes anyone bring a lamp home and put it under a washtub or beneath the bed?

Really listening?", "24-25": "\u201cListen carefully to what I am saying\u2014and be wary of the shrewd advice that tells you how to get ahead in the world on your own. Giving, not getting, is the way. Generosity begets generosity. Stinginess impoverishes.\u201d", "26-29": "Then Jesus said, \u201cGod's kingdom is like seed thrown on a field by a man who then goes to bed and forgets about it. The seed sprouts and grows\u2014he has no idea how it happens. The earth does it all without his help: first a green stem of grass, then a bud, then the ripened grain.

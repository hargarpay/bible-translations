{"1-2": "Then Jesus started telling them stories. \u201cA man planted a vineyard. He fenced it, dug a winepress, erected a watchtower, turned it over to the farmhands, and went off on a trip. At the time for harvest, he sent a servant back to the farmhands to collect his profits.", "3-5": "\u201cThey grabbed him, beat him up, and sent him off empty-handed. So he sent another servant. That one they tarred and feathered. He sent another and that one they killed. And on and on, many others. Some they beat up, some they killed.", "6": "\u201cFinally there was only one left: a beloved son. In a last-ditch effort, he sent him, thinking, 'Surely they will respect my son.'", "7-8": "\u201cBut those farmhands saw their chance. They rubbed their hands together in greed and said, 'This is the heir! Let's kill him and have it all for ourselves.' They grabbed him, killed him, and threw him over the fence.", "9-11": "\u201cWhat do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Right. He'll come and clean house. Then he'll assign the care of the vineyard to others. Read it for yourselves in Scripture: That stone the masons threw out is now the cornerstone! This is God's work; we rub our eyes\u2014we can hardly believe it!\u201d", "12": "They wanted to lynch him then and there but, intimidated by public opinion, held back. They knew the story was about them. They got away from there as fast as they could.", "13-14": "They sent some Pharisees and followers of Herod to bait him, hoping to catch him saying something incriminating. They came up and said, \u201cTeacher, we know you have integrity, that you are indifferent to public opinion, don't pander to your students, and teach the way of God accurately. Tell us: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\u201d", "15-16": "He knew it was a trick question, and said, \u201cWhy are you playing these games with me? Bring me a coin and let me look at it.\u201d They handed him one. \u201cThis engraving\u2014who does it look like? And whose name is on it?\u201d \u201cCaesar,\u201d they said.", "17": "Jesus said, \u201cGive Caesar what is his, and give God what is his.\u201d Their mouths hung open, speechless.", "18-23": "Some Sadducees, the party that denies any possibility of resurrection, came up and asked, \u201cTeacher, Moses wrote that if a man dies and leaves a wife but no child, his brother is obligated to marry the widow and have children. Well, there once were seven brothers. The first took a wife. He died childless. The second married her. He died, and still no child. The same with the third. All seven took their turn, but no child. Finally the wife died. When they are raised at the resurrection, whose wife is she? All seven were her husband.\u201d", "24-27": "Jesus said, \u201cYou're way off base, and here's why: One, you don't know your Bibles; two, you don't know how God works. After the dead are raised up, we're past the marriage business. As it is with angels now, all our ecstasies and intimacies then will be with God. And regarding the dead, whether or not they are raised, don't you ever read the Bible? How God at the bush said to Moses, 'I am\u2014not was\u2014the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? The living God is God of the living, not the dead. You're way, way off base.\u201d", "28": "One of the religion scholars came up. Hearing the lively exchanges of question and answer and seeing how sharp Jesus was in his answers, he put in his question: \u201cWhich is most important of all the commandments?\u201d", "29-31": "Jesus said, \u201cThe first in importance is, 'Listen, Israel: The Lord your God is one; so love the Lord God with all your passion and prayer and intelligence and energy.' And here is the second: 'Love others as well as you love yourself.' There is no other commandment that ranks with these.\u201d", "32-33": "The religion scholar said, \u201cA wonderful answer, Teacher! So lucid and accurate\u2014that God is one and there is no other. And loving him with all passion and intelligence and energy, and loving others as well as you love yourself. Why, that's better than all offerings and sacrifices put together!\u201d", "34": "When Jesus realized how insightful he was, he said, \u201cYou're almost there, right on the border of God's kingdom.\u201d After that, no one else dared ask a question.", "35-37": "While he was teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, \u201cHow is it that the religion scholars say that the Messiah is David's 'son,' when we all know that David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, said, God said to my Master, \u201cSit here at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\u201d \u201cDavid here designates the Messiah 'my Master'\u2014so how can the Messiah also be his 'son'?\u201d The large crowd was delighted with what they heard.", "38-40": "He continued teaching. \u201cWatch out for the religion scholars. They love to walk around in academic gowns, preening in the radiance of public flattery, basking in prominent positions, sitting at the head table at every church function. And all the time they are exploiting the weak and helpless. The longer their prayers, the worse they get. But they'll pay for it in the end.\u201d", "41-44": "Sitting across from the offering box, he was observing how the crowd tossed money in for the collection. Many of the rich were making large contributions. One poor widow came up and put in two small coins\u2014a measly two cents. Jesus called his disciples over and said, \u201cThe truth is that this poor widow gave more to the collection than all the others put together. All the others gave what they'll never miss; she gave extravagantly what she couldn't afford\u2014she gave her all.\u201d"}

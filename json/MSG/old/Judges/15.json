{"1-2": "Later on\u2014it was during the wheat harvest\u2014Samson visited his bride, bringing a young goat. He said, \u201cLet me see my wife\u2014show me her bedroom.\u201d But her father wouldn't let him in. He said, \u201cI concluded that by now you hated her with a passion, so I gave her to your best man. But her little sister is even more beautiful. Why not take her instead?\u201d", "3": "Samson said, \u201cThat does it. This time when I wreak havoc on the Philistines, I'm blameless.\u201d", "4-5": "Samson then went out and caught three hundred jackals. He lashed the jackals' tails together in pairs and tied a torch between each pair of tails. He then set fire to the torches and let them loose in the Philistine fields of ripe grain. Everything burned, both stacked and standing grain, vineyards and olive orchards\u2014everything.", "6": "The Philistines said, \u201cWho did this?\u201d They were told, \u201cSamson, son-in-law of the Timnite who took his bride and gave her to his best man.\u201d The Philistines went up and burned both her and her father to death.", "7": "Samson then said, \u201cIf this is the way you're going to act, I swear I'll get even with you. And I'm not quitting till the job's done!\u201d", "8": "With that he tore into them, ripping them limb from limb\u2014a huge slaughter. Then he went down and stayed in a cave at Etam Rock.", "9-10": "The Philistines set out and made camp in Judah, preparing to attack Lehi (Jawbone). When the men of Judah asked, \u201cWhy have you come up against us?\u201d they said, \u201cWe're out to get Samson. We're going after Samson to do to him what he did to us.\u201d", "11": "Three companies of men from Judah went down to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson, \u201cDon't you realize that the Philistines already bully and lord it over us? So what's going on with you, making things even worse?\u201d He said, \u201cIt was tit for tat. I only did to them what they did to me.\u201d", "12": "They said, \u201cWell, we've come down here to tie you up and turn you over to the Philistines.\u201d Samson said, \u201cJust promise not to hurt me.\u201d", "13": "\u201cWe promise,\u201d they said. \u201cWe will tie you up and surrender you to them but, believe us, we won't kill you.\u201d They proceeded to tie him with new ropes and led him up from the Rock.", "14-16": "As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him, shouting in triumph. And then the Spirit of God came on him with great power. The ropes on his arms fell apart like flax on fire; the thongs slipped off his hands. He spotted a fresh donkey jawbone, reached down and grabbed it, and with it killed the whole company. And Samson said, With a donkey's jawbone I made heaps of donkeys of them. With a donkey's jawbone I killed an entire company.", "17": "When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone. He named that place Ramath Lehi (Jawbone Hill).", "18-19": "Now he was suddenly very thirsty. He called out to God, \u201cYou have given your servant this great victory. Are you going to abandon me to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?\u201d So God split open the rock basin in Lehi; water gushed out and Samson drank. His spirit revived\u2014he was alive again! That's why it's called En Hakkore (Caller's Spring). It's still there at Lehi today.", "20": "Samson judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines."}

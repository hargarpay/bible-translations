{"1": "A Message. God's Word to Israel through Malachi:", "2-3": "God said, \u201cI love you.\u201d You replied, \u201cReally? How have you loved us?\u201d \u201cLook at history\u201d (this is God's answer). \u201cLook at how differently I've treated you, Jacob, from Esau: I loved Jacob and hated Esau. I reduced pretentious Esau to a molehill, turned his whole country into a ghost town.\u201d", "4": "When Edom (Esau) said, \u201cWe've been knocked down, but we'll get up and start over, good as new,\u201d God-of-the-Angel-Armies said, \u201cJust try it and see how far you get. When I knock you down, you stay down. People will take one look at you and say, 'Land of Evil!' and 'the God-cursed tribe!'", "5": "\u201cYes, take a good look. Then you'll see how faithfully I've loved you and you'll want even more, saying, 'May God be even greater, beyond the borders of Israel!'", "6": "\u201cIsn't it true that a son honors his father and a worker his master? So if I'm your Father, where's the honor? If I'm your Master, where's the respect?\u201d God-of-the-Angel-Armies is calling you on the carpet: \u201cYou priests despise me! \u201cYou say, 'Not so! How do we despise you?' \u201cBy your shoddy, sloppy, defiling worship. \u201cYou ask, 'What do you mean, \u201cdefiling\u201d? What's defiling about it?'", "7-8": "\u201cWhen you say, 'The altar of God is not important anymore; worship of God is no longer a priority,' that's defiling. And when you offer worthless animals for sacrifices in worship, animals that you're trying to get rid of\u2014blind and sick and crippled animals\u2014isn't that defiling? Try a trick like that with your banker or your senator\u2014how far do you think it will get you?\u201d God-of-the-Angel-Armies asks you.", "9": "\u201cGet on your knees and pray that I will be gracious to you. You priests have gotten everyone in trouble. With this kind of conduct, do you think I'll pay attention to you?\u201d God-of-the-Angel-Armies asks you.", "10": "\u201cWhy doesn't one of you just shut the Temple doors and lock them? Then none of you can get in and play at religion with this silly, empty-headed worship. I am not pleased. The God-of-the-Angel-Armies is not pleased. And I don't want any more of this so-called worship!", "11": "\u201cI am honored all over the world. And there are people who know how to worship me all over the world, who honor me by bringing their best to me. They're saying it everywhere: 'God is greater, this God-of-the-Angel-Armies.'", "12-13": "\u201cAll except you. Instead of honoring me, you profane me. You profane me when you say, 'Worship is not important, and what we bring to worship is of no account,' and when you say, 'I'm bored\u2014this doesn't do anything for me.' You act so superior, sticking your noses in the air\u2014act superior to me, God-of-the-Angel-Armies! And when you do offer something to me, it's a hand-me-down, or broken, or useless. Do you think I'm going to accept it? This is God speaking to you!", "14": "\u201cA curse on the person who makes a big show of doing something great for me\u2014an expensive sacrifice, say\u2014and then at the last minute brings in something puny and worthless!

Indolent and pampered, you demand of your husbands, 'Bring us a tall, cool drink!'", "2-3": "\u201cThis is serious\u2014I, God, have sworn by my holiness! Be well warned: Judgment Day is coming! They're going to rope you up and haul you off, keep the stragglers in line with cattle prods. They'll drag you through the ruined city walls, forcing you out single file, And kick you to kingdom come.\u201d God's Decree.", "4-5": "\u201cCome along to Bethel and sin! And then to Gilgal and sin some more! Bring your sacrifices for morning worship. Every third day bring your tithe. Burn pure sacrifices\u2014thank offerings. Speak up\u2014announce freewill offerings! That's the sort of religious show you Israelites just love.\u201d God's Decree.", "6": "\u201cYou know, don't you, that I'm the One who emptied your pantries and cleaned out your cupboards, Who left you hungry and standing in bread lines?

The stink of rot in your camps was so strong that you held your noses\u2014 But you didn't notice me. You continued to ignore me.\u201d God's Decree.", "11": "\u201cI hit you with earthquake and fire, left you devastated like Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the flames. But you never looked my way. You continued to ignore me.\u201d God's Decree.", "12": "\u201cAll this I have done to you, Israel, and this is why I have done it. Time's up, O Israel! Prepare to meet your God!\u201d", "13": "Look who's here: Mountain-Shaper! Wind-Maker! He laid out the whole plot before Adam. He brings everything out of nothing, like dawn out of darkness. He strides across the alpine ridges. His name is God, God-of-the-Angel-Armies."}

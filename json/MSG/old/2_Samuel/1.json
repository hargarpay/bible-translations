Three days later a man showed up unannounced from Saul's army camp.", "2-3": "Disheveled and obviously in mourning, he fell to his knees in respect before David. David asked, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d He answered, \u201cI've just escaped from the camp of Israel.\u201d", "4": "\u201cSo what happened?\u201d said David. \u201cWhat's the news?\u201d He said, \u201cThe Israelites have fled the battlefield, leaving a lot of their dead comrades behind. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.\u201d", "5": "David pressed the young soldier for details: \u201cHow do you know for sure that Saul and Jonathan are dead?\u201d", "6-8": "\u201cI just happened by Mount Gilboa and came on Saul, badly wounded and leaning on his spear, with enemy chariots and horsemen bearing down hard on him. He looked behind him, saw me, and called me to him. 'Yes sir,' I said, 'at your service.' He asked me who I was, and I told him, 'I'm an Amalekite.'\u201d", "9": "\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, \u201cand put me out of my misery. I'm nearly dead already, but my life hangs on.\u201d", "10": "\u201cSo I did what he asked\u2014I killed him. I knew he wouldn't last much longer anyway. I removed his royal headband and bracelet, and have brought them to my master. Here they are.\u201d", "11-12": "In lament, David ripped his clothes to ribbons. All the men with him did the same. They wept and fasted the rest of the day, grieving the death of Saul and his son Jonathan, and also the army of God and the nation Israel, victims in a failed battle.", "13": "Then David spoke to the young soldier who had brought the report: \u201cWho are you, anyway?\u201d \u201cI'm from an immigrant family\u2014an Amalekite.\u201d", "14-15": "\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d said David, \u201cthat you weren't afraid to up and kill God's anointed king?\u201d Right then he ordered one of his soldiers, \u201cStrike him dead!\u201d The soldier struck him, and he died.", "16": "\u201cYou asked for it,\u201d David told him. \u201cYou sealed your death sentence when you said you killed God's anointed king.\u201d", "17-18": "Then David sang this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan, and gave orders that everyone in Judah learn it by heart. Yes, it's even inscribed in The Book of Jashar.", "19-21": "Oh, oh, Gazelles of Israel, struck down on your hills, the mighty warriors\u2014fallen, fallen! Don't announce it in the city of Gath, don't post the news in the streets of Ashkelon. Don't give those coarse Philistine girls one more excuse for a drunken party! No more dew or rain for you, hills of Gilboa, and not a drop from springs and wells, For there the warriors' shields were dragged through the mud, Saul's shield left there to rot.", "22": "Jonathan's bow was bold\u2014 the bigger they were the harder they fell. Saul's sword was fearless\u2014 once out of the scabbard, nothing could stop it.", "23": "Saul and Jonathan\u2014beloved, beautiful! Together in life, together in death. Swifter than plummeting eagles, stronger than proud lions.", "24-25": "Women of Israel, weep for Saul. He dressed you in finest cottons and silks, spared no expense in making you elegant. The mighty warriors\u2014fallen, fallen in the middle of the fight! Jonathan\u2014struck down on your hills!", "26": "O my dear brother Jonathan, I'm crushed by your death. Your friendship was a miracle-wonder, love far exceeding anything I've known\u2014 or ever hope to know.", "27": "The mighty warriors\u2014fallen, fallen. And the arms of war broken to bits."}

God was furious, his anger blazing out against Israel.", "4": "God said to Moses, \u201cTake all the leaders of Israel and kill them by hanging, leaving them publicly exposed in order to turn God's anger away from Israel.\u201d", "5": "Moses issued orders to the judges of Israel: \u201cEach of you must execute the men under your jurisdiction who joined in the worship of Baal Peor.\u201d", "6-9": "Just then, while everyone was weeping in penitence at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, an Israelite man, flaunting his behavior in front of Moses and the whole assembly, paraded a Midianite woman into his family tent.

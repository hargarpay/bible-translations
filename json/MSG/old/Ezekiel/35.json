{"1-4": "God's Message came to me: \u201cSon of man, confront Mount Seir. Prophesy against it! Tell them, 'God, the Master, says: \u201c'I'm coming down hard on you, Mount Seir. I'm stepping in and turning you to a pile of rubble. I'll reduce your towns to piles of rocks. There'll be nothing left of you. Then you'll realize that I am God.", "5-9": "\u201c'I'm doing this because you've kept this age-old grudge going against Israel: You viciously attacked them when they were already down, looking their final punishment in the face. Therefore, as sure as I am the living God, I'm lining you up for a real bloodbath. Since you loved blood so much, you'll be chased by rivers of blood. I'll reduce Mount Seir to a heap of rubble. No one will either come or go from that place! I'll blanket your mountains with corpses. Massacred bodies will cover your hills and fill up your valleys and ditches. I'll reduce you to ruins and all your towns will be ghost towns\u2014population zero. Then you'll realize that I am God.", "10-13": "\u201c'Because you said, \u201cThese two nations, these two countries, are mine. I'm taking over\u201d (even though God is right there watching, right there listening), I'll turn your hate-bloated anger and rage right back on you. You'll know I mean business when I bring judgment on you. You'll realize then that I, God, have overheard all the vile abuse you've poured out against the mountains of Israel, saying, \u201cThey're roadkill and we're going to eat them up.\u201d You've strutted around, talking so big, insolently pitting yourselves against me. And I've heard it all.", "14-15": "\u201c'This is the verdict of God, the Master: With the whole earth applauding, I'll demolish you. Since you danced in the streets, thinking it was so wonderful when Israel's inheritance was demolished, I'll give you the same treatment: demolition. Mount Seir demolished\u2014yes, every square inch of Edom. Then they'll realize that I am God!'\u201d"}

Tell them, 'If I bring war on this land and the people take one of their citizens and make him their watchman, and if the watchman sees war coming and blows the trumpet, warning the people, then if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet and ignores it and war comes and takes him off, it's his own fault. He heard the alarm, he ignored it\u2014it's his own fault. If he had listened, he would have saved his life.", "6": "\u201c'But if the watchman sees war coming and doesn't blow the trumpet, warning the people, and war comes and takes anyone off, I'll hold the watchman responsible for the bloodshed of any unwarned sinner.'", "7-9": "\u201cYou, son of man, are the watchman. I've made you a watchman for Israel. The minute you hear a message from me, warn them. If I say to the wicked, 'Wicked man, wicked woman, you're on the fast track to death!' and you don't speak up and warn the wicked to change their ways, the wicked will die unwarned in their sins and I'll hold you responsible for their bloodshed. But if you warn the wicked to change their ways and they don't do it, they'll die in their sins well-warned and at least you will have saved your own life.", "10": "\u201cSon of man, speak to Israel.

Tell your people, 'A good person's good life won't save him when he decides to rebel, and a bad person's bad life won't prevent him from repenting of his rebellion. A good person who sins can't expect to live when he chooses to sin. It's true that I tell good people, \u201cLive! Be alive!\u201d But if they trust in their good deeds and turn to evil, that good life won't amount to a hill of beans. They'll die for their evil life.", "14-16": "\u201c'On the other hand, if I tell a wicked person, \u201cYou'll die for your wicked life,\u201d and he repents of his sin and starts living a righteous and just life\u2014being generous to the down-and-out, restoring what he had stolen, cultivating life-nourishing ways that don't hurt others\u2014he'll live.

Your people meet on street corners and in front of their houses and say, 'Let's go hear the latest news from God.' They show up, as people tend to do, and sit in your company. They listen to you speak, but don't do a thing you say. They flatter you with compliments, but all they care about is making money and getting ahead. To them you're merely entertainment\u2014a country singer of sad love songs, playing a guitar. They love to hear you talk, but nothing comes of it.", "33": "\u201cBut when all this happens\u2014and it is going to happen!\u2014they'll realize that a prophet was among them.\u201d"}

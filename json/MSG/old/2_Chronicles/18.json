{"1-3": "But even though Jehoshaphat was very rich and much honored, he made a marriage alliance with Ahab of Israel. Some time later he paid a visit to Ahab at Samaria. Ahab celebrated his visit with a feast\u2014a huge barbecue with all the lamb and beef you could eat. But Ahab had a hidden agenda; he wanted Jehoshaphat's support in attacking Ramoth Gilead. Then Ahab brought it into the open: \u201cWill you join me in attacking Ramoth Gilead?\u201d Jehoshaphat said, \u201cYou bet. I'm with you all the way; you can count on me and my troops.\u201d", "4": "Then Jehoshaphat said, \u201cBut before you do anything, ask God for guidance.\u201d", "5": "The king of Israel got the prophets together\u2014all four hundred of them\u2014and put the question to them: \u201cShould I attack Ramoth Gilead or should I hold back?\u201d \u201cGo for it,\u201d they said. \u201cGod will hand it over to the king.\u201d", "6": "But Jehoshaphat dragged his feet, \u201cIs there another prophet of God around here we can consult? Let's get a second opinion.\u201d", "7": "The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, \u201cAs a matter of fact, there is another. But I hate him. He never preaches anything good to me, only doom, doom, doom\u2014Micaiah son of Imlah.\u201d \u201cThe king shouldn't talk about a prophet like that!\u201d said Jehoshaphat.", "8": "So the king of Israel ordered one of his men, \u201cQuickly, get Micaiah son of Imlah.\u201d", "9-11": "Meanwhile, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat were seated on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, resplendent in front of the Samaria city gates. All the prophets were staging a prophecy-performance for their benefit. Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had even made a set of iron horns, and brandishing them, called out, \u201cGod's word! With these horns you'll gore Aram until there's nothing left of them!\u201d All the prophets chimed in, \u201cYes! Go for Ramoth Gilead! An easy victory! God's gift to the king!\u201d", "12": "The messenger who went to get Micaiah told him, \u201cThe prophets have all said Yes to the king. Make it unanimous\u2014vote Yes!\u201d", "13": "But Micaiah said, \u201cAs sure as God lives, what God says, I'll say.\u201d", "14": "With Micaiah before him, the king asked him, \u201cSo, Micaiah\u2014do we attack Ramoth Gilead? Or do we hold back?\u201d \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said, \u201can easy victory! God's gift to the king.\u201d", "15": "\u201cNot so fast,\u201d said the king. \u201cHow many times have I made you promise under oath to tell me the truth and nothing but the truth?\u201d", "16": "\u201cAll right,\u201d said Micaiah, \u201csince you insist\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I saw all of Israel scattered over the hills, sheep with no shepherd. Then God spoke, 'These poor people have no one to tell them what to do. Let them go home and do the best they can for themselves.'\u201d", "17": "The king of Israel turned to Jehoshaphat, \u201cSee! What did I tell you? He never has a good word for me from God, only doom.\u201d", "18-21": "Micaiah kept on, \u201cI'm not done yet; listen to God's word: I saw God enthroned, and all the Angel Armies of heaven standing at attention, ranged on his right and his left. And God said, \u201cHow can we seduce Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead?\u201d Some said this, and some said that. Then a bold angel stepped out, stood before God, and said, \u201cI'll seduce him.\u201d \u201cAnd how will you do it?\u201d said God. \u201cEasy,\u201d said the angel, \u201cI'll get all the prophets to lie.\u201d \u201cThat should do it,\u201d said God; \u201cOn your way\u2014seduce him!\u201d", "22": "\u201cAnd that's what has happened. God filled the mouths of your puppet prophets with seductive lies. God has pronounced your doom.\u201d", "23": "Just then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah came up and slapped Micaiah in the face, saying, \u201cSince when did the Spirit of God leave me and take up with you?\u201d", "24": "Micaiah said, \u201cYou'll know soon enough; you'll know it when you're frantically and futilely looking for a place to hide.\u201d", "25-26": "The king of Israel had heard enough: \u201cGet Micaiah out of here! Turn him over to Amon the city magistrate and to Joash the king's son with this message: 'King's orders! Lock him up in jail; keep him on bread and water until I'm back in one piece.'\u201d", "27": "Micaiah said, If you ever get back in one piece, I'm no prophet of God. He added, When it happens, O people, remember where you heard it!", "28-29": "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went ahead and attacked Ramoth Gilead. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cWear my kingly robe; I'm going into battle disguised.\u201d So the king of Israel entered the battle in disguise.", "30": "Meanwhile, the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders (there were thirty-two of them), \u201cDon't bother with anyone whether small or great; go after the king of Israel and him only.\u201d", "31-32": "When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, \u201cThere he is! The king of Israel!\u201d and took after him. Jehoshaphat yelled out, and the chariot commanders realized they had the wrong man\u2014it wasn't the king of Israel after all. God intervened and they let him go.", "33": "Just then someone, without aiming, shot an arrow into the crowd and hit the king of Israel in the chink of his armor. The king told his charioteer, \u201cTurn back! Get me out of here\u2014I'm wounded.\u201d", "34": "All day the fighting continued, hot and heavy. Propped up in his chariot, the king watched from the sidelines. He died that evening."}

God has ordered a famine in the land; it will last for seven years.\u201d The woman did what the Holy Man told her and left. She and her family lived as aliens in the country of Philistia for seven years. Then, when the seven years were up, the woman and her family came back. She went directly to the king and asked for her home and farm.", "4-5": "The king was talking with Gehazi, servant to the Holy Man, saying, \u201cTell me some stories of the great things Elisha did.\u201d It so happened that as he was telling the king the story of the dead person brought back to life, the woman whose son was brought to life showed up asking for her home and farm.

The fact is, though\u2014God showed me\u2014that he's doomed to die.\u201d Elisha then stared hard at Hazael, reading his heart. Hazael felt exposed and dropped his eyes. Then the Holy Man wept.", "12": "Hazael said, \u201cWhy does my master weep?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Elisha, \u201cI know what you're going to do to the children of Israel: burn down their forts, murder their youth, smash their babies, rip open their pregnant women.\u201d", "13": "Hazael said, \u201cAm I a mongrel dog that I'd do such a horrible thing?\u201d \u201cGod showed me,\u201d said Elisha, \u201cthat you'll be king of Aram.\u201d", "14": "Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master, who asked, \u201cSo, what did Elisha tell you?\u201d \u201cHe told me, 'Don't worry; you'll live.'\u201d", "15": "But the very next day, someone took a heavy quilt, soaked it in water, covered the king's face, and suffocated him.

He was thirty-two years old when he began his rule, and was king for eight years in Jerusalem. He copied the way of life of the kings of Israel, marrying into the Ahab family and continuing the Ahab line of sin\u2014from God's point of view, an evil man living an evil life. But despite that, because of his servant David, God was not ready to destroy Judah. He had, after all, promised to keep a lamp burning through David's descendants.", "20-21": "During Jehoram's reign, Edom revolted against Judah's rule and set up their own king.

Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king; he ruled only a year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. He lived and ruled just like the Ahab family had done, continuing the same evil-in-God's-sight line of sin, related by both marriage and sin to the Ahab clan.", "28-29": "He joined Joram son of Ahab king of Israel in a war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead.

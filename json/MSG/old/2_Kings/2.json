{"1-2": "Just before God took Elijah to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on a walk out of Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here. God has sent me on an errand to Bethel.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cNot on your life! I'm not letting you out of my sight!\u201d So they both went to Bethel.", "3": "The guild of prophets at Bethel met Elisha and said, \u201cDid you know that God is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI know it. But keep it quiet.\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here. God has sent me on an errand to Jericho.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cNot on your life! I'm not letting you out of my sight!\u201d So they both went to Jericho.", "5": "The guild of prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said, \u201cDid you know that God is going to take your master away from you today?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI know it. But keep it quiet.\u201d", "6": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here. God has sent me on an errand to the Jordan.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cNot on your life! I'm not letting you out of my sight!\u201d And so the two of them went their way together.", "7": "Meanwhile, fifty men from the guild of prophets gathered some distance away while the two of them stood at the Jordan.", "8": "Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and hit the water with it. The river divided and the two men walked through on dry land.", "9": "When they reached the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cWhat can I do for you before I'm taken from you? Ask anything.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cYour life repeated in my life. I want to be a holy man just like you.\u201d", "10": "\u201cThat's a hard one!\u201d said Elijah. \u201cBut if you're watching when I'm taken from you, you'll get what you've asked for. But only if you're watching.\u201d", "11-14": "And so it happened. They were walking along and talking. Suddenly a chariot and horses of fire came between them and Elijah went up in a whirlwind to heaven. Elisha saw it all and shouted, \u201cMy father, my father! You\u2014the chariot and cavalry of Israel!\u201d When he could no longer see anything, he grabbed his robe and ripped it to pieces. Then he picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him, returned to the shore of the Jordan, and stood there. He took Elijah's cloak\u2014all that was left of Elijah!\u2014and hit the river with it, saying, \u201cNow where is the God of Elijah? Where is he?\u201d When he struck the water, the river divided and Elisha walked through.", "15": "The guild of prophets from Jericho saw the whole thing from where they were standing. They said, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah lives in Elisha!\u201d They welcomed and honored him.", "16": "They then said, \u201cWe're at your service. We have fifty reliable men here; let's send them out to look for your master. Maybe God's spirit has swept him off to some mountain or dropped him into a remote ravine.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cNo. Don't send them.\u201d", "17": "But they pestered him until he caved in: \u201cGo ahead then. Send them.\u201d So they sent the fifty men off. For three days they looked, searching high and low. Nothing.", "18": "Finally, they returned to Elisha in Jericho. He told them, \u201cSo there\u2014didn't I tell you?\u201d", "19": "One day the men of the city said to Elisha, \u201cYou can see for yourself, master, how well our city is located. But the water is polluted and nothing grows.\u201d", "20": "He said, \u201cBring me a brand-new bowl and put some salt in it.\u201d They brought it to him.", "21-22": "He then went to the spring, sprinkled the salt into it, and proclaimed, \u201cGod's word: I've healed this water. It will no longer kill you or poison your land.\u201d And sure enough, the water was healed\u2014and remains so to this day, just as Elisha said.", "23": "Another time, Elisha was on his way to Bethel and some little kids came out from the town and taunted him, \u201cWhat's up, old baldhead! Out of our way, skinhead!\u201d", "24": "Elisha turned, took one look at them, and cursed them in the name of God. Two bears charged out of the underbrush and knocked them about, ripping them limb from limb\u2014forty-two children in all!", "25": "Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and then returned to Samaria."}

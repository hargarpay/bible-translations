Exploited people at Mizpah, ripped them off on Tabor, Victimized them at Shittim. I'm going to punish the lot of you.", "3-4": "\u201cI know you, Ephraim, inside and out. Yes, Israel, I see right through you! Ephraim, you've played your sex-and-religion games long enough. All Israel is thoroughly polluted. They couldn't turn to God if they wanted to. Their evil life is a bad habit. Every breath they take is a whore's breath. They wouldn't recognize God if they saw me.", "5-7": "\u201cBloated by arrogance, big as a house, they're a public disgrace, The lot of them\u2014Israel, Ephraim, Judah\u2014 lurching and weaving down their guilty streets. When they decide to get their lives together and go off looking for God once again, They'll find it's too late. I, God, will be long gone. They've played fast and loose with me for too long, filling the country with their bastard offspring. A plague of locusts will devastate their violated land.", "8-9": "\u201cBlow the ram's horn shofar in Gibeah, the bugle in Ramah! Signal the invasion of Sin City! Scare the daylights out of Benjamin!

Every inch of their bodies is going to feel my anger.", "11-12": "\u201cBrutal Ephraim is himself brutalized\u2014 a taste of his own medicine! He was so determined to do it his own worthless way. Therefore I'm pus to Ephraim, dry rot in the house of Judah.", "13": "\u201cWhen Ephraim saw he was sick and Judah saw his pus-filled sores, Ephraim went running to Assyria, went for help to the big king. But he can't heal you. He can't cure your oozing sores.", "14-15": "\u201cI'm a grizzly charging Ephraim, a grizzly with cubs charging Judah. I'll rip them to pieces\u2014yes, I will! No one can stop me now. I'll drag them off. No one can help them. Then I'll go back to where I came from until they come to their senses. When they finally hit rock bottom, maybe they'll come looking for me.\u201d"}

They came across the story there about the time that Mordecai had exposed the plot of Bigthana and Teresh\u2014the two royal eunuchs who guarded the entrance and who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.", "3": "The king asked, \u201cWhat great honor was given to Mordecai for this?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the king's servants who were in attendance. \u201cNothing has been done for him.\u201d", "4": "The king said, \u201cIs there anybody out in the court?\u201d Now Haman had just come into the outer court of the king's palace to talk to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had built for him.", "5": "The king's servants said, \u201cHaman is out there, waiting in the court.\u201d \u201cBring him in,\u201d said the king.", "6-9": "When Haman entered, the king said, \u201cWhat would be appropriate for the man the king especially wants to honor?\u201d Haman thought to himself, \u201cHe must be talking about honoring me\u2014who else?\u201d So he answered the king, \u201cFor the man the king delights to honor, do this: Bring a royal robe that the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crown on its head.

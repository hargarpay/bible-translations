Do what God tells you. Walk in the paths he shows you: Follow the life-map absolutely, keep an eye out for the signposts, his course for life set out in the revelation to Moses; then you'll get on well in whatever you do and wherever you go. Then God will confirm what he promised me when he said, 'If your sons watch their step, staying true to me heart and soul, you'll always have a successor on Israel's throne.'", "5-6": "\u201cAnd don't forget what Joab son of Zeruiah did to the two commanders of Israel's army, to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether. He murdered them in cold blood, acting in peacetime as if he were at war, and has been stained with that blood ever since. Do what you think best with him, but by no means let him get off scot-free\u2014make him pay.", "7": "\u201cBut be generous to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite\u2014extend every hospitality to them; that's the way they treated me when I was running for my life from Absalom your brother.", "8-9": "\u201cYou also will have to deal with Shimei son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim, the one who cursed me so viciously when I was on my way to Mahanaim. Later, when he welcomed me back at the Jordan, I promised him under God, 'I won't put you to death.' But neither should you treat him as if nothing ever happened. You're wise, you know how to handle these things. You'll know what to do to make him pay before he dies.\u201d", "10-12": "Then David joined his ancestors. He was buried in the City of David. David ruled Israel for forty years\u2014seven years in Hebron and another thirty-three in Jerusalem. Solomon took over on the throne of his father David; he had a firm grip on the kingdom.", "13-14": "Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother.

Why don't you just ask me to hand over the whole kingdom to him on a platter since he is my older brother and has Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah on his side!\u201d", "23-24": "Then King Solomon swore under God, \u201cMay God do his worst to me if Adonijah doesn't pay for this with his life!

You deserve death but I'm not going to kill you\u2014for now anyway\u2014because you were in charge of the Chest of our ruling God in the company of David my father, and because you shared all the hard times with my father.\u201d", "27": "Solomon stripped Abiathar of his priesthood, fulfilling God's word at Shiloh regarding the family of Eli.", "28-29": "When this news reached Joab, this Joab who had conspired with Adonijah (although he had remained loyal in the Absalom affair), he took refuge in the sanctuary of God, seizing the horns of the Altar and holding on for dear life.

Absolve me and my father's family of the guilt from Joab's senseless murders. God is avenging those bloody murders on Joab's head. Two men he murdered, men better by far than he ever was: Behind my father's back he brutally murdered Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army. Responsibility for their murders is forever fixed on Joab and his descendants; but for David and his descendants, his family and kingdom, the final verdict is God's peace.\u201d", "34-35": "So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went back, struck Joab, and killed him. He was buried in his family plot out in the desert. The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.", "36-37": "The king next called in Shimei and told him, \u201cBuild yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but you are not to leave the area.

And then he came back, bringing his slaves.", "41": "Solomon was told, \u201cShimei left Jerusalem for Gath, and now he's back.\u201d", "42-43": "Solomon then called for Shimei and said, \u201cDidn't I make you promise me under God, and give you a good warning besides, that you would not leave this area? That if you left you would have decreed your own death sentence? And didn't you say, 'Oh, thank you\u2014I'll do exactly as you say'? So why didn't you keep your sacred promise and do what I ordered?\u201d", "44-45": "Then the king told Shimei, \u201cDeep in your heart you know all the evil that you did to my father David; God will now avenge that evil on you.

{"1-3": "They enjoyed three years of peace\u2014no fighting between Aram and Israel. In the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah had a meeting with the king of Israel. Israel's king remarked to his aides, \u201cDo you realize that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us, and we're sitting around on our hands instead of taking it back from the king of Aram?\u201d", "4-5": "He turned to Jehoshaphat and said, \u201cWill you join me in fighting for Ramoth Gilead?\u201d Jehoshaphat said, \u201cYou bet. I'm with you all the way\u2014my troops are your troops, my horses are your horses.\u201d He then continued, \u201cBut before you do anything, ask God for guidance.\u201d", "6": "The king of Israel got the prophets together\u2014all four hundred of them\u2014and put the question to them: \u201cShould I attack Ramoth Gilead? Or should I hold back?\u201d \u201cGo for it,\u201d they said. \u201cGod will hand it over to the king.\u201d", "7": "But Jehoshaphat dragged his heels: \u201cIs there still another prophet of God around here we can consult?\u201d", "8": "The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, \u201cAs a matter of fact, there is still one such man. But I hate him. He never preaches anything good to me, only doom, doom, doom\u2014Micaiah son of Imlah.\u201d \u201cThe king shouldn't talk about a prophet like that,\u201d said Jehoshaphat.", "9": "So the king of Israel ordered one of his men, \u201cOn the double! Get Micaiah son of Imlah.\u201d", "10-12": "Meanwhile, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat were seated on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, resplendent in front of the Samaria city gates. All the prophets were staging a prophecy-performance for their benefit. Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had even made a set of iron horns, and brandishing them called out, \u201cGod's word! With these horns you'll gore Aram until there's nothing left of him!\u201d All the prophets chimed in, \u201cYes! Go for Ramoth Gilead! An easy victory! God's gift to the king!\u201d", "13": "The messenger who went to get Micaiah said, \u201cThe prophets have all said Yes to the king. Make it unanimous\u2014vote Yes!\u201d", "14": "But Micaiah said, \u201cAs surely as God lives, what God says, I'll say.\u201d", "15": "With Micaiah before him, the king asked him, \u201cSo Micaiah\u2014do we attack Ramoth Gilead, or do we hold back?\u201d \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cAn easy victory. God's gift to the king.\u201d", "16": "\u201cNot so fast,\u201d said the king. \u201cHow many times have I made you promise under oath to tell me the truth and nothing but the truth?\u201d", "17": "\u201cAll right,\u201d said Micaiah, \u201csince you insist. I saw all of Israel scattered over the hills, sheep with no shepherd. Then God spoke: 'These poor people have no one to tell them what to do. Let them go home and do the best they can for themselves.'\u201d", "18": "Then the king of Israel turned to Jehoshaphat, \u201cSee! What did I tell you? He never has a good word for me from God, only doom.\u201d", "19-23": "Micaiah kept on: \u201cI'm not done yet; listen to God's word: I saw God enthroned, and all the angel armies of heaven Standing at attention ranged on his right and his left. And God said, 'How can we seduce Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead?' Some said this, and some said that. Then a bold angel stepped out, stood before God, and said, 'I'll seduce him.' 'And how will you do it?' said God. 'Easy,' said the angel, 'I'll get all the prophets to lie.' 'That should do it,' said God. 'On your way\u2014seduce him!' \u201cAnd that's what has happened. God filled the mouths of your puppet prophets with seductive lies. God has pronounced your doom.\u201d", "24": "Just then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah came up and punched Micaiah in the nose, saying, \u201cSince when did the Spirit of God leave me and take up with you?\u201d", "25": "Micaiah said, \u201cYou'll know soon enough; you'll know it when you're frantically and futilely looking for a place to hide.\u201d", "26-27": "The king of Israel had heard enough: \u201cGet Micaiah out of here! Turn him over to Amon the city magistrate and to Joash the king's son with this message, 'King's orders: Lock him up in jail; keep him on bread and water until I'm back in one piece.'\u201d", "28": "Micaiah said, \u201cIf you ever get back in one piece, I'm no prophet of God.\u201d He added,\u201cWhen it happens, O people, remember where you heard it!\u201d", "29-30": "The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cWear my kingly robe; I'm going into battle disguised.\u201d So the king of Israel entered the battle in disguise.", "31": "Meanwhile, the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders (there were thirty-two of them): \u201cDon't bother with anyone, whether small or great; go after the king of Israel and him only.\u201d", "32-33": "When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat they said, \u201cThere he is! The king of Israel!\u201d and took after him. Jehoshaphat yelled out, and the chariot commanders realized they had the wrong man\u2014it wasn't the king of Israel after all. They let him go.", "34": "Just then someone, without aiming, shot an arrow randomly into the crowd and hit the king of Israel in the chink of his armor. The king told his charioteer, \u201cTurn back! Get me out of here\u2014I'm wounded.\u201d", "35-37": "All day the fighting continued, hot and heavy. Propped up in his chariot, the king watched from the sidelines. He died that evening. Blood from his wound pooled in the chariot. As the sun went down, shouts reverberated through the ranks, \u201cAbandon camp! Head for home! The king is dead!\u201d", "37-38": "The king was brought to Samaria and there they buried him. They washed down the chariot at the pool of Samaria where the town whores bathed, and the dogs lapped up the blood, just as God's word had said.", "39-40": "The rest of Ahab's life\u2014everything he did, the ivory palace he built, the towns he founded, and the defense system he built up\u2014is all written up in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. He was buried in the family cemetery and his son Ahaziah was the next king.", "41-44": "Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king and he ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. He continued the kind of life characteristic of his father Asa\u2014no detours, no dead ends\u2014pleasing God with his life. But he failed to get rid of the neighborhood sex-and-religion shrines. People continued to pray and worship at these idolatrous shrines. And he kept on good terms with the king of Israel.", "45-46": "The rest of Jehoshaphat's life, his achievements and his battles, is all written in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. Also, he got rid of the sacred prostitutes left over from the days of his father Asa.", "47": "Edom was kingless during his reign; a deputy was in charge.", "48-49": "Jehoshaphat built ocean-going ships to sail to Ophir for gold. But they never made it; they shipwrecked at Ezion Geber. During that time Ahaziah son of Ahab proposed a joint shipping venture, but Jehoshaphat wouldn't go in with him.", "50": "Then Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the family cemetery in the City of David his ancestor. Jehoram his son was the next king.", "51-53": "Ahaziah son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. He ruled Israel for two years. As far as God was concerned, he lived an evil life, reproducing the bad life of his father and mother, repeating the pattern set down by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into a life of sin. Worshiping at the Baal shrines, he made God, the God of Israel, angry, oh, so angry. If anything, he was worse than his father."}

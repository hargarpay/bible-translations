{"1-3": "I said to myself, \u201cLet's go for it\u2014experiment with pleasure, have a good time!\u201d But there was nothing to it, nothing but smoke. What do I think of the fun-filled life? Insane! Inane! My verdict on the pursuit of happiness? Who needs it? With the help of a bottle of wine and all the wisdom I could muster, I tried my level best to penetrate the absurdity of life. I wanted to get a handle on anything useful we mortals might do during the years we spend on this earth.", "4-8": "Oh, I did great things: built houses, planted vineyards, designed gardens and parks and planted a variety of fruit trees in them, made pools of water to irrigate the groves of trees. I bought slaves, male and female, who had children, giving me even more slaves; then I acquired large herds and flocks, larger than any before me in Jerusalem. I piled up silver and gold, loot from kings and kingdoms. I gathered a chorus of singers to entertain me with song, and\u2014most exquisite of all pleasures\u2014 voluptuous maidens for my bed.", "9-10": "Oh, how I prospered! I left all my predecessors in Jerusalem far behind, left them behind in the dust. What's more, I kept a clear head through it all. Everything I wanted I took\u2014I never said no to myself. I gave in to every impulse, held back nothing. I sucked the marrow of pleasure out of every task\u2014my reward to myself for a hard day's work!", "11": "Then I took a good look at everything I'd done, looked at all the sweat and hard work. But when I looked, I saw nothing but smoke. Smoke and spitting into the wind. There was nothing to any of it. Nothing.", "12-14": "And then I took a hard look at what's smart and what's stupid. What's left to do after you've been king? That's a hard act to follow. You just do what you can, and that's it. But I did see that it's better to be smart than stupid, just as light is better than darkness. Even so, though the smart ones see where they're going and the stupid ones grope in the dark, they're all the same in the end. One fate for all\u2014and that's it.", "15-16": "When I realized that my fate's the same as the fool's, I had to ask myself, \u201cSo why bother being wise?\u201d It's all smoke, nothing but smoke. The smart and the stupid both disappear out of sight. In a day or two they're both forgotten. Yes, both the smart and the stupid die, and that's it.", "17": "I hate life. As far as I can see, what happens on earth is a bad business. It's smoke\u2014and spitting into the wind.", "18-19": "And I hated everything I'd accomplished and accumulated on this earth. I can't take it with me\u2014no, I have to leave it to whoever comes after me. Whether they're worthy or worthless\u2014and who's to tell?\u2014they'll take over the earthly results of my intense thinking and hard work. Smoke.", "20-23": "That's when I called it quits, gave up on anything that could be hoped for on this earth. What's the point of working your fingers to the bone if you hand over what you worked for to someone who never lifted a finger for it? Smoke, that's what it is. A bad business from start to finish. So what do you get from a life of hard labor? Pain and grief from dawn to dusk. Never a decent night's rest. Nothing but smoke.", "24-26": "The best you can do with your life is have a good time and get by the best you can. The way I see it, that's it\u2014divine fate. Whether we feast or fast, it's up to God. God may give wisdom and knowledge and joy to his favorites, but sinners are assigned a life of hard labor, and end up turning their wages over to God's favorites. Nothing but smoke\u2014and spitting into the wind."}

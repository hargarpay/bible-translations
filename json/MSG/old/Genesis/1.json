In the middle of the waters; separate water from water!\u201d God made sky. He separated the water under sky from the water above sky.

It was evening, it was morning\u2014 Day Three.", "14-15": "God spoke: \u201cLights! Come out! Shine in Heaven's sky! Separate Day from Night. Mark seasons and days and years, Lights in Heaven's sky to give light to Earth.\u201d And there it was.", "16-19": "God made two big lights, the larger to take charge of Day, The smaller to be in charge of Night; and he made the stars. God placed them in the heavenly sky to light up Earth And oversee Day and Night, to separate light and dark. God saw that it was good. It was evening, it was morning\u2014 Day Four.", "20-23": "God spoke: \u201cSwarm, Ocean, with fish and all sea life! Birds, fly through the sky over Earth!\u201d God created the huge whales, all the swarm of life in the waters, And every kind and species of flying birds. God saw that it was good.

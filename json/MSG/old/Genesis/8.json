The underground springs were shut off, the windows of Heaven closed and the rain quit. Inch by inch the water lowered. After 150 days the worst was over.", "4-6": "On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ship landed on the Ararat mountain range. The water kept going down until the tenth month.

After forty days Noah opened the window that he had built into the ship.", "7-9": "He sent out a raven; it flew back and forth waiting for the floodwaters to dry up. Then he sent a dove to check on the flood conditions, but it couldn't even find a place to perch\u2014water still covered the Earth. Noah reached out and caught it, brought it back into the ship.", "10-11": "He waited seven more days and sent out the dove again. It came back in the evening with a freshly picked olive leaf in its beak. Noah knew that the flood was about finished.", "12": "He waited another seven days and sent the dove out a third time.

He selected clean animals and birds from every species and offered them as burnt offerings on the altar. God smelled the sweet fragrance and thought to himself, \u201cI'll never again curse the ground because of people. I know they have this bent toward evil from an early age, but I'll never again kill off everything living as I've just done.", "22": "For as long as Earth lasts, planting and harvest, cold and heat, Summer and winter, day and night will never stop.\u201d"}

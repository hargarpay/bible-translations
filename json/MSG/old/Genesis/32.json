{"1-2": "And Jacob went his way. Angels of God met him. When Jacob saw them he said, \u201cOh! God's Camp!\u201d And he named the place Mahanaim (Campground).", "3-5": "Then Jacob sent messengers on ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir in Edom. He instructed them: \u201cTell my master Esau this, 'A message from your servant Jacob: I've been staying with Laban and couldn't get away until now. I've acquired cattle and donkeys and sheep; also men and women servants. I'm telling you all this, my master, hoping for your approval.'\u201d", "6": "The messengers came back to Jacob and said, \u201cWe talked to your brother Esau and he's on his way to meet you. But he has four hundred men with him.\u201d", "7-8": "Jacob was scared. Very scared. Panicked, he divided his people, sheep, cattle, and camels into two camps. He thought, \u201cIf Esau comes on the first camp and attacks it, the other camp has a chance to get away.\u201d", "9-12": "And then Jacob prayed, \u201cGod of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, God who told me, 'Go back to your parents' homeland and I'll treat you well.' I don't deserve all the love and loyalty you've shown me. When I left here and crossed the Jordan I only had the clothes on my back, and now look at me\u2014two camps! Save me, please, from the violence of my brother, my angry brother! I'm afraid he'll come and attack us all, me, the mothers and the children. You yourself said, 'I will treat you well; I'll make your descendants like the sands of the sea, far too many to count.'\u201d", "13-16": "He slept the night there. Then he prepared a present for his brother Esau from his possessions: two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty camels with their nursing young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. He put a servant in charge of each herd and said, \u201cGo ahead of me and keep a healthy space between each herd.\u201d", "17-18": "Then he instructed the first one out: \u201cWhen my brother Esau comes close and asks, 'Who is your master? Where are you going? Who owns these?'\u2014answer him like this, 'Your servant Jacob. They are a gift to my master Esau. He's on his way.'\u201d", "19-20": "He gave the same instructions to the second servant and to the third\u2014to each in turn as they set out with their herds: \u201cSay 'Your servant Jacob is on his way behind us.'\u201d He thought, \u201cI will soften him up with the succession of gifts. Then when he sees me face-to-face, maybe he'll be glad to welcome me.\u201d", "21": "So his gifts went before him while he settled down for the night in the camp.", "22-23": "But during the night he got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven children and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He got them safely across the brook along with all his possessions.", "24-25": "But Jacob stayed behind by himself, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak. When the man saw that he couldn't get the best of Jacob as they wrestled, he deliberately threw Jacob's hip out of joint.", "26": "The man said, \u201cLet me go; it's daybreak.\u201d Jacob said, \u201cI'm not letting you go 'til you bless me.\u201d", "27": "The man said, \u201cWhat's your name?\u201d He answered, \u201cJacob.\u201d", "28": "The man said, \u201cBut no longer. Your name is no longer Jacob. From now on it's Israel (God-Wrestler); you've wrestled with God and you've come through.\u201d", "29": "Jacob asked, \u201cAnd what's your name?\u201d The man said, \u201cWhy do you want to know my name?\u201d And then, right then and there, he blessed him.", "30": "Jacob named the place Peniel (God's Face) because, he said, \u201cI saw God face-to-face and lived to tell the story!\u201d", "31-32": "The sun came up as he left Peniel, limping because of his hip. (This is why Israelites to this day don't eat the hip muscle; because Jacob's hip was thrown out of joint.)"}

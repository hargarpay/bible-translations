We can eat from the trees in the garden. It's only about the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, 'Don't eat from it; don't even touch it or you'll die.'\u201d", "4-5": "The serpent told the Woman, \u201cYou won't die. God knows that the moment you eat from that tree, you'll see what's really going on. You'll be just like God, knowing everything, ranging all the way from good to evil.\u201d", "6": "When the Woman saw that the tree looked like good eating and realized what she would get out of it\u2014she'd know everything!\u2014she took and ate the fruit and then gave some to her husband, and he ate.", "7": "Immediately the two of them did \u201csee what's really going on\u201d\u2014saw themselves naked!

And I hid.\u201d", "11": "God said, \u201cWho told you you were naked? Did you eat from that tree I told you not to eat from?\u201d", "12": "The Man said, \u201cThe Woman you gave me as a companion, she gave me fruit from the tree, and, yes, I ate it.\u201d God said to the Woman, \u201cWhat is this that you've done?\u201d", "13": "\u201cThe serpent seduced me,\u201d she said, \u201cand I ate.\u201d", "14-15": "God told the serpent: \u201cBecause you've done this, you're cursed, cursed beyond all cattle and wild animals, Cursed to slink on your belly and eat dirt all your life. I'm declaring war between you and the Woman, between your offspring and hers. He'll wound your head, you'll wound his heel.\u201d", "16": "He told the Woman: \u201cI'll multiply your pains in childbirth; you'll give birth to your babies in pain.

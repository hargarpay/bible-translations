{"1": "The Messenger-Angel again called me to attention. It was like being wakened out of deep sleep.", "2-3": "He said, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d I answered, \u201cI see a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top. Seven lamps, each with seven spouts, are set on the bowl. And there are two olive trees, one on either side of the bowl.\u201d", "4": "Then I asked the Messenger-Angel, \u201cWhat does this mean, sir?\u201d", "5-7": "The Messenger-Angel said, \u201cCan't you tell?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d I said. Then he said, \u201cThis is God's Message to Zerubbabel: 'You can't force these things. They only come about through my Spirit,' says God-of-the-Angel-Armies. 'So, big mountain, who do you think you are? Next to Zerubbabel you're nothing but a molehill. He'll proceed to set the Cornerstone in place, accompanied by cheers: Yes! Yes! Do it!'\u201d", "8-10": "After that, the Word of God came to me: \u201cZerubbabel started rebuilding this Temple and he will complete it.

They'll change their tune when they see Zerubbabel setting the last stone in place!\u201d Going back to the vision, the Messenger-Angel said, \u201cThe seven lamps are the eyes of God probing the dark corners of the world like searchlights.\u201d", "11-12": "And the two olive trees on either side of the lampstand?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat's the meaning of them? And while you're at it, the two branches of the olive trees that feed oil to the lamps\u2014what do they mean?\u201d", "13": "He said, \u201cYou haven't figured that out?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d", "14": "He said, \u201cThese are the two who stand beside the Master of the whole earth and supply golden lamp oil worldwide.\u201d"}

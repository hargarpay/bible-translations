{"1-6": "God, investigate my life; get all the facts firsthand. I'm an open book to you; even from a distance, you know what I'm thinking. You know when I leave and when I get back; I'm never out of your sight. You know everything I'm going to say before I start the first sentence. I look behind me and you're there, then up ahead and you're there, too\u2014 your reassuring presence, coming and going. This is too much, too wonderful\u2014 I can't take it all in!", "7-12": "Is there anyplace I can go to avoid your Spirit? to be out of your sight? If I climb to the sky, you're there! If I go underground, you're there! If I flew on morning's wings to the far western horizon, You'd find me in a minute\u2014 you're already there waiting! Then I said to myself, \u201cOh, he even sees me in the dark! At night I'm immersed in the light!\u201d It's a fact: darkness isn't dark to you; night and day, darkness and light, they're all the same to you.", "13-16": "Oh yes, you shaped me first inside, then out; you formed me in my mother's womb. I thank you, High God\u2014you're breathtaking! Body and soul, I am marvelously made! I worship in adoration\u2014what a creation! You know me inside and out, you know every bone in my body; You know exactly how I was made, bit by bit, how I was sculpted from nothing into something. Like an open book, you watched me grow from conception to birth; all the stages of my life were spread out before you, The days of my life all prepared before I'd even lived one day.", "17-22": "Your thoughts\u2014how rare, how beautiful! God, I'll never comprehend them! I couldn't even begin to count them\u2014 any more than I could count the sand of the sea. Oh, let me rise in the morning and live always with you! And please, God, do away with wickedness for good! And you murderers\u2014out of here!\u2014 all the men and women who belittle you, God, infatuated with cheap god-imitations. See how I hate those who hate you, God, see how I loathe all this godless arrogance; I hate it with pure, unadulterated hatred. Your enemies are my enemies!", "23-24": "Investigate my life, O God, find out everything about me; Cross-examine and test me, get a clear picture of what I'm about; See for yourself whether I've done anything wrong\u2014 then guide me on the road to eternal life."}

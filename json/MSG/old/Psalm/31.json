{"1-2": "I run to you, God; I run for dear life. Don't let me down! Take me seriously this time! Get down on my level and listen, and please\u2014no procrastination! Your granite cave a hiding place, your high cliff aerie a place of safety.", "3-5": "You're my cave to hide in, my cliff to climb. Be my safe leader, be my true mountain guide. Free me from hidden traps; I want to hide in you. I've put my life in your hands. You won't drop me, you'll never let me down.", "6-13": "I hate all this silly religion, but you, God, I trust. I'm leaping and singing in the circle of your love; you saw my pain, you disarmed my tormentors, You didn't leave me in their clutches but gave me room to breathe. Be kind to me, God\u2014 I'm in deep, deep trouble again. I've cried my eyes out; I feel hollow inside. My life leaks away, groan by groan; my years fade out in sighs. My troubles have worn me out, turned my bones to powder. To my enemies I'm a monster; I'm ridiculed by the neighbors. My friends are horrified; they cross the street to avoid me. They want to blot me from memory, forget me like a corpse in a grave, discard me like a broken dish in the trash. The street-talk gossip has me \u201ccriminally insane\u201d! Behind locked doors they plot how to ruin me for good.", "14-18": "Desperate, I throw myself on you: you are my God! Hour by hour I place my days in your hand, safe from the hands out to get me. Warm me, your servant, with a smile; save me because you love me. Don't embarrass me by not showing up; I've given you plenty of notice. Embarrass the wicked, stand them up, leave them stupidly shaking their heads as they drift down to hell. Gag those loudmouthed liars who heckle me, your follower, with jeers and catcalls.", "19-22": "What a stack of blessing you have piled up for those who worship you, Ready and waiting for all who run to you to escape an unkind world. You hide them safely away from the opposition. As you slam the door on those oily, mocking faces, you silence the poisonous gossip. Blessed God! His love is the wonder of the world. Trapped by a siege, I panicked. \u201cOut of sight, out of mind,\u201d I said. But you heard me say it, you heard and listened.", "23": "Love God, all you saints; God takes care of all who stay close to him, But he pays back in full those arrogant enough to go it alone.", "24": "Be brave. Be strong. Don't give up. Expect God to get here soon."}

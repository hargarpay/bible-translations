{"1-3": "Open your ears, God, to my prayer; don't pretend you don't hear me knocking. Come close and whisper your answer. I really need you. I shudder at the mean voice, quail before the evil eye, As they pile on the guilt, stockpile angry slander.", "4-8": "My insides are turned inside out; specters of death have me down. I shake with fear, I shudder from head to foot. \u201cWho will give me wings,\u201d I ask\u2014 \u201cwings like a dove?\u201d Get me out of here on dove wings; I want some peace and quiet. I want a walk in the country, I want a cabin in the woods. I'm desperate for a change from rage and stormy weather.", "9-11": "Come down hard, Lord\u2014slit their tongues. I'm appalled how they've split the city Into rival gangs prowling the alleys Day and night spoiling for a fight, trash piled in the streets, Even shopkeepers gouging and cheating in broad daylight.", "12-14": "This isn't the neighborhood bully mocking me\u2014I could take that. This isn't a foreign devil spitting invective\u2014I could tune that out. It's you! We grew up together! You! My best friend! Those long hours of leisure as we walked arm in arm, God a third party to our conversation.", "15": "Haul my betrayers off alive to hell\u2014let them experience the horror, let them feel every desolate detail of a damned life.", "16-19": "I call to God; God will help me. At dusk, dawn, and noon I sigh deep sighs\u2014he hears, he rescues. My life is well and whole, secure in the middle of danger Even while thousands are lined up against me. God hears it all, and from his judge's bench puts them in their place. But, set in their ways, they won't change; they pay him no mind.", "20-21": "And this, my best friend, betrayed his best friends; his life betrayed his word. All my life I've been charmed by his speech, never dreaming he'd turn on me. His words, which were music to my ears, turned to daggers in my heart.", "22-23": "Pile your troubles on God's shoulders\u2014 he'll carry your load, he'll help you out. He'll never let good people topple into ruin. But you, God, will throw the others into a muddy bog, Cut the lifespan of assassins and traitors in half. And I trust in you."}

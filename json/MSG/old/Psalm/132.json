{"1-5": "O God, remember David, remember all his troubles! And remember how he promised God, made a vow to the Strong God of Jacob, \u201cI'm not going home, and I'm not going to bed, I'm not going to sleep, not even take time to rest, Until I find a home for God, a house for the Strong God of Jacob.\u201d", "6-7": "Remember how we got the news in Ephrathah, learned all about it at Jaar Meadows? We shouted, \u201cLet's go to the shrine dedication! Let's worship at God's own footstool!\u201d", "8-10": "Up, God, enjoy your new place of quiet repose, you and your mighty covenant ark; Get your priests all dressed up in justice; prompt your worshipers to sing this prayer: \u201cHonor your servant David; don't disdain your anointed one.\u201d", "11-18": "God gave David his word, he won't back out on this promise: \u201cOne of your sons I will set on your throne; If your sons stay true to my Covenant and learn to live the way I teach them, Their sons will continue the line\u2014 always a son to sit on your throne. Yes\u2014I, God, chose Zion, the place I wanted for my shrine; This will always be my home; this is what I want, and I'm here for good. I'll shower blessings on the pilgrims who come here, and give supper to those who arrive hungry; I'll dress my priests in salvation clothes; the holy people will sing their hearts out! Oh, I'll make the place radiant for David! I'll fill it with light for my anointed! I'll dress his enemies in dirty rags, but I'll make his crown sparkle with splendor.\u201d"}

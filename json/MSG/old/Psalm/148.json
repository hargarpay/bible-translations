{"1-5": "Hallelujah! Praise God from heaven, praise him from the mountaintops; Praise him, all you his angels, praise him, all you his warriors, Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, you morning stars; Praise him, high heaven, praise him, heavenly rain clouds; Praise, oh let them praise the name of God\u2014 he spoke the word, and there they were!", "6": "He set them in place from all time to eternity; He gave his orders, and that's it!", "7-12": "Praise God from earth, you sea dragons, you fathomless ocean deeps; Fire and hail, snow and ice, hurricanes obeying his orders; Mountains and all hills, apple orchards and cedar forests; Wild beasts and herds of cattle, snakes, and birds in flight; Earth's kings and all races, leaders and important people, Robust men and women in their prime, and yes, graybeards and little children.", "13-14": "Let them praise the name of God\u2014 it's the only Name worth praising. His radiance exceeds anything in earth and sky; he's built a monument\u2014his very own people! Praise from all who love God! Israel's children, intimate friends of God. Hallelujah!"}

{"1-2": "Quick, God, I need your helping hand! The last decent person just went down, All the friends I depended on gone. Everyone talks in lie language; Lies slide off their oily lips. They doubletalk with forked tongues.", "3-4": "Slice their lips off their faces! Pull The braggart tongues from their mouths! I'm tired of hearing, \u201cWe can talk anyone into anything! Our lips manage the world.\u201d", "5": "Into the hovels of the poor, Into the dark streets where the homeless groan, God speaks: \u201cI've had enough; I'm on my way To heal the ache in the heart of the wretched.\u201d", "6-8": "God's words are pure words, Pure silver words refined seven times In the fires of his word-kiln, Pure on earth as well as in heaven. God, keep us safe from their lies, From the wicked who stalk us with lies, From the wicked who collect honors For their wonderful lies."}

{"1-6": "Why the big noise, nations? Why the mean plots, peoples? Earth-leaders push for position, Demagogues and delegates meet for summit talks, The God-deniers, the Messiah-defiers: \u201cLet's get free of God! Cast loose from Messiah!\u201d Heaven-throned God breaks out laughing. At first he's amused at their presumption; Then he gets good and angry. Furiously, he shuts them up: \u201cDon't you know there's a King in Zion? A coronation banquet Is spread for him on the holy summit.\u201d", "7-9": "Let me tell you what God said next. He said, \u201cYou're my son, And today is your birthday. What do you want? Name it: Nations as a present? continents as a prize? You can command them all to dance for you, Or throw them out with tomorrow's trash.\u201d", "10-12": "So, rebel-kings, use your heads; Upstart-judges, learn your lesson: Worship God in adoring embrace, Celebrate in trembling awe. Kiss Messiah! Your very lives are in danger, you know; His anger is about to explode, But if you make a run for God\u2014you won't regret it!"}

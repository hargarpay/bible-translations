Once, in a tight place, you gave me room; Now I'm in trouble again: grace me! hear me!", "2": "You rabble\u2014how long do I put up with your scorn? How long will you lust after lies? How long will you live crazed by illusion?", "3": "Look at this: look Who got picked by God! He listens the split second I call to him.", "4-5": "Complain if you must, but don't lash out. Keep your mouth shut, and let your heart do the talking.

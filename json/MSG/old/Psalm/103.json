{"1-2": "O my soul, bless God. From head to toe, I'll bless his holy name! O my soul, bless God, don't forget a single blessing!", "3-5": "He forgives your sins\u2014every one. He heals your diseases\u2014every one. He redeems you from hell\u2014saves your life! He crowns you with love and mercy\u2014a paradise crown. He wraps you in goodness\u2014beauty eternal. He renews your youth\u2014you're always young in his presence.", "6-18": "God makes everything come out right; he puts victims back on their feet. He showed Moses how he went about his work, opened up his plans to all Israel. God is sheer mercy and grace; not easily angered, he's rich in love. He doesn't endlessly nag and scold, nor hold grudges forever. He doesn't treat us as our sins deserve, nor pay us back in full for our wrongs. As high as heaven is over the earth, so strong is his love to those who fear him. And as far as sunrise is from sunset, he has separated us from our sins. As parents feel for their children, God feels for those who fear him. He knows us inside and out, keeps in mind that we're made of mud. Men and women don't live very long; like wildflowers they spring up and blossom, But a storm snuffs them out just as quickly, leaving nothing to show they were here. God's love, though, is ever and always, eternally present to all who fear him, Making everything right for them and their children as they follow his Covenant ways and remember to do whatever he said.", "19-22": "God has set his throne in heaven; he rules over us all. He's the King! So bless God, you angels, ready and able to fly at his bidding, quick to hear and do what he says. Bless God, all you armies of angels, alert to respond to whatever he wills. Bless God, all creatures, wherever you are\u2014 everything and everyone made by God. And you, O my soul, bless God!"}

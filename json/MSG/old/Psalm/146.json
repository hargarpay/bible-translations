{"1-2": "Hallelujah! O my soul, praise God! All my life long I'll praise God, singing songs to my God as long as I live.", "3-9": "Don't put your life in the hands of experts who know nothing of life, of salvation life. Mere humans don't have what it takes; when they die, their projects die with them. Instead, get help from the God of Jacob, put your hope in God and know real blessing! God made sky and soil, sea and all the fish in it. He always does what he says\u2014 he defends the wronged, he feeds the hungry. God frees prisoners\u2014 he gives sight to the blind, he lifts up the fallen. God loves good people, protects strangers, takes the side of orphans and widows, but makes short work of the wicked.", "10": "God's in charge\u2014always. Zion's God is God for good! Hallelujah!"}

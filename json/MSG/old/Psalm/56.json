{"1-4": "Take my side, God\u2014I'm getting kicked around, stomped on every day. Not a day goes by but somebody beats me up; They make it their duty to beat me up. When I get really afraid I come to you in trust. I'm proud to praise God; fearless now, I trust in God. What can mere mortals do?", "5-6": "They don't let up\u2014 they smear my reputation and huddle to plot my collapse. They gang up, sneak together through the alleys To take me by surprise, wait their chance to get me.", "7": "Pay them back in evil! Get angry, God! Down with these people!", "8": "You've kept track of my every toss and turn through the sleepless nights, Each tear entered in your ledger, each ache written in your book.", "9": "If my enemies run away, turn tail when I yell at them, Then I'll know that God is on my side.", "10-11": "I'm proud to praise God, proud to praise God. Fearless now, I trust in God; what can mere mortals do to me?", "12-13": "God, you did everything you promised, and I'm thanking you with all my heart. You pulled me from the brink of death, my feet from the cliff-edge of doom. Now I stroll at leisure with God in the sunlit fields of life."}

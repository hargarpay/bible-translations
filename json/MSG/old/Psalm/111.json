{"1-10": "Hallelujah! I give thanks to God with everything I've got\u2014 Wherever good people gather, and in the congregation. God's works are so great, worth A lifetime of study\u2014endless enjoyment! Splendor and beauty mark his craft; His generosity never gives out. His miracles are his memorial\u2014 This God of Grace, this God of Love. He gave food to those who fear him, He remembered to keep his ancient promise. He proved to his people that he could do what he said: Hand them the nations on a platter\u2014a gift! He manufactures truth and justice; All his products are guaranteed to last\u2014 Never out-of-date, never obsolete, rust-proof. All that he makes and does is honest and true: He paid the ransom for his people, He ordered his Covenant kept forever. He's so personal and holy, worthy of our respect. The good life begins in the fear of God\u2014 Do that and you'll know the blessing of God. His Hallelujah lasts forever!"}

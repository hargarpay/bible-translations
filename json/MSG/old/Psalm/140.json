{"1-5": "God, get me out of here, away from this evil; protect me from these vicious people. All they do is think up new ways to be bad; they spend their days plotting war games. They practice the sharp rhetoric of hate and hurt, speak venomous words that maim and kill. God, keep me out of the clutch of these wicked ones, protect me from these vicious people; Stuffed with self-importance, they plot ways to trip me up, determined to bring me down. These crooks invent traps to catch me and do their best to incriminate me.", "6-8": "I prayed, \u201cGod, you're my God! Listen, God! Mercy! God, my Lord, Strong Savior, protect me when the fighting breaks out! Don't let the wicked have their way, God, don't give them an inch!\u201d", "9-11": "These troublemakers all around me\u2014 let them drown in their own verbal poison. Let God pile hellfire on them, let him bury them alive in crevasses! These loudmouths\u2014 don't let them be taken seriously; These savages\u2014 let the Devil hunt them down!", "12-13": "I know that you, God, are on the side of victims, that you care for the rights of the poor. And I know that the righteous personally thank you, that good people are secure in your presence."}

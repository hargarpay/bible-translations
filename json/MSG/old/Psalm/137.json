{"1-3": "Alongside Babylon's rivers we sat on the banks; we cried and cried, remembering the good old days in Zion. Alongside the quaking aspens we stacked our unplayed harps; That's where our captors demanded songs, sarcastic and mocking: \u201cSing us a happy Zion song!\u201d", "4-6": "Oh, how could we ever sing God's song in this wasteland? If I ever forget you, Jerusalem, let my fingers wither and fall off like leaves. Let my tongue swell and turn black if I fail to remember you, If I fail, O dear Jerusalem, to honor you as my greatest.", "7-9": "God, remember those Edomites, and remember the ruin of Jerusalem, That day they yelled out, \u201cWreck it, smash it to bits!\u201d And you, Babylonians\u2014ravagers! A reward to whoever gets back at you for all you've done to us; Yes, a reward to the one who grabs your babies and smashes their heads on the rocks!"}

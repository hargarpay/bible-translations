{"1-4": "Hallelujah! Praise the name of God, praise the works of God. All you priests on duty in God's temple, serving in the sacred halls of our God, Shout \u201cHallelujah!\u201d because God's so good, sing anthems to his beautiful name. And why? Because God chose Jacob, embraced Israel as a prize possession.", "5-12": "I, too, give witness to the greatness of God, our Lord, high above all other gods. He does just as he pleases\u2014 however, wherever, whenever. He makes the weather\u2014clouds and thunder, lightning and rain, wind pouring out of the north. He struck down the Egyptian firstborn, both human and animal firstborn. He made Egypt sit up and take notice, confronted Pharaoh and his servants with miracles. Yes, he struck down great nations, he slew mighty kings\u2014 Sihon king of the Amorites, also Og of Bashan\u2014 every last one of the Canaanite kings! Then he turned their land over to Israel, a gift of good land to his people.", "13-18": "God, your name is eternal, God, you'll never be out-of-date. God stands up for his people, God holds the hands of his people. The gods of the godless nations are mere trinkets, made for quick sale in the markets: Chiseled mouths that can't talk, painted eyes that can't see, Carved ears that can't hear\u2014 dead wood! cold metal! Those who make and trust them become like them.", "19-21": "Family of Israel, bless God! Family of Aaron, bless God! Family of Levi, bless God! You who fear God, bless God! Oh, blessed be God of Zion, First Citizen of Jerusalem! Hallelujah!"}

{"1-2": "Clear my name, God; stick up for me against these loveless, immoral people. Get me out of here, away from these lying degenerates. I counted on you, God. Why did you walk out on me? Why am I pacing the floor, wringing my hands over these outrageous people?", "3-4": "Give me your lantern and compass, give me a map, So I can find my way to the sacred mountain, to the place of your presence, To enter the place of worship, meet my exuberant God, Sing my thanks with a harp, magnificent God, my God.", "5": "Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on God\u2014 soon I'll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He's my God."}

{"1-4": "Thank God because he's good, because his love never quits. Tell the world, Israel, \u201cHis love never quits.\u201d And you, clan of Aaron, tell the world, \u201cHis love never quits.\u201d And you who fear God, join in, \u201cHis love never quits.\u201d", "5-16": "Pushed to the wall, I called to God; from the wide open spaces, he answered. God's now at my side and I'm not afraid; who would dare lay a hand on me? God's my strong champion; I flick off my enemies like flies. Far better to take refuge in God than trust in people; Far better to take refuge in God than trust in celebrities. Hemmed in by barbarians, in God's name I rubbed their faces in the dirt; Hemmed in and with no way out, in God's name I rubbed their faces in the dirt; Like swarming bees, like wild prairie fire, they hemmed me in; in God's name I rubbed their faces in the dirt. I was right on the cliff-edge, ready to fall, when God grabbed and held me. God's my strength, he's also my song, and now he's my salvation. Hear the shouts, hear the triumph songs in the camp of the saved? \u201cThe hand of God has turned the tide! The hand of God is raised in victory! The hand of God has turned the tide!\u201d", "17-20": "I didn't die. I lived! And now I'm telling the world what God did. God tested me, he pushed me hard, but he didn't hand me over to Death. Swing wide the city gates\u2014the righteous gates! I'll walk right through and thank God! This Temple Gate belongs to God, so the victors can enter and praise.", "21-25": "Thank you for responding to me; you've truly become my salvation! The stone the masons discarded as flawed is now the capstone! This is God's work. We rub our eyes\u2014we can hardly believe it! This is the very day God acted\u2014 let's celebrate and be festive! Salvation now, God. Salvation now! Oh yes, God\u2014a free and full life!", "26-29": "Blessed are you who enter in God's name\u2014 from God's house we bless you! God is God, he has bathed us in light. Festoon the shrine with garlands, hang colored banners above the altar! You're my God, and I thank you. O my God, I lift high your praise. Thank God\u2014he's so good. His love never quits!"}

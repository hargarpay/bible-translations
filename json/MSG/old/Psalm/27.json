{"1": "Light, space, zest\u2014 that's God! So, with him on my side I'm fearless, afraid of no one and nothing.", "2": "When vandal hordes ride down ready to eat me alive, Those bullies and toughs fall flat on their faces.", "3": "When besieged, I'm calm as a baby. When all hell breaks loose, I'm collected and cool.", "4": "I'm asking God for one thing, only one thing: To live with him in his house my whole life long. I'll contemplate his beauty; I'll study at his feet.", "5": "That's the only quiet, secure place in a noisy world, The perfect getaway, far from the buzz of traffic.", "6": "God holds me head and shoulders above all who try to pull me down. I'm headed for his place to offer anthems that will raise the roof! Already I'm singing God-songs; I'm making music to God.", "7-9": "Listen, God, I'm calling at the top of my lungs: \u201cBe good to me! Answer me!\u201d When my heart whispered, \u201cSeek God,\u201d my whole being replied, \u201cI'm seeking him!\u201d Don't hide from me now!", "9-10": "You've always been right there for me; don't turn your back on me now. Don't throw me out, don't abandon me; you've always kept the door open. My father and mother walked out and left me, but God took me in.", "11-12": "Point me down your highway, God; direct me along a well-lighted street; show my enemies whose side you're on. Don't throw me to the dogs, those liars who are out to get me, filling the air with their threats.", "13-14": "I'm sure now I'll see God's goodness in the exuberant earth. Stay with God! Take heart. Don't quit. I'll say it again: Stay with God."}

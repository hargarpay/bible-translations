{"1-3": "It seemed like a dream, too good to be true, when God returned Zion's exiles. We laughed, we sang, we couldn't believe our good fortune. We were the talk of the nations\u2014 \u201cGod was wonderful to them!\u201d God was wonderful to us; we are one happy people.", "4-6": "And now, God, do it again\u2014 bring rains to our drought-stricken lives So those who planted their crops in despair will shout hurrahs at the harvest, So those who went off with heavy hearts will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing."}

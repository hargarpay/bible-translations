{"1-3": "Hallelujah! You who serve God, praise God! Just to speak his name is praise! Just to remember God is a blessing\u2014 now and tomorrow and always. From east to west, from dawn to dusk, keep lifting all your praises to God!", "4-9": "God is higher than anything and anyone, outshining everything you can see in the skies. Who can compare with God, our God, so majestically enthroned, Surveying his magnificent heavens and earth? He picks up the poor from out of the dirt, rescues the wretched who've been thrown out with the trash, Seats them among the honored guests, a place of honor among the brightest and best. He gives childless couples a family, gives them joy as the parents of children. Hallelujah!"}

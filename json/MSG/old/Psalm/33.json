Invent your own new song to him; give him a trumpet fanfare.", "4-5": "For God's Word is solid to the core; everything he makes is sound inside and out. He loves it when everything fits, when his world is in plumb-line true. Earth is drenched in God's affectionate satisfaction.", "6-7": "The skies were made by God's command; he breathed the word and the stars popped out.

Horsepower is not the answer; no one gets by on muscle alone.", "18-19": "Watch this: God's eye is on those who respect him, the ones who are looking for his love. He's ready to come to their rescue in bad times; in lean times he keeps body and soul together.", "20-22": "We're depending on God; he's everything we need. What's more, our hearts brim with joy since we've taken for our own his holy name. Love us, God, with all you've got\u2014 that's what we're depending on."}

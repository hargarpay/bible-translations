{"1-6": "I love God because he listened to me, listened as I begged for mercy. He listened so intently as I laid out my case before him. Death stared me in the face, hell was hard on my heels. Up against it, I didn't know which way to turn; then I called out to God for help: \u201cPlease, God!\u201d I cried out. \u201cSave my life!\u201d God is gracious\u2014it is he who makes things right, our most compassionate God. God takes the side of the helpless; when I was at the end of my rope, he saved me.", "7-8": "I said to myself, \u201cRelax and rest. God has showered you with blessings. Soul, you've been rescued from death; Eye, you've been rescued from tears; And you, Foot, were kept from stumbling.\u201d", "9-11": "I'm striding in the presence of God, alive in the land of the living! I stayed faithful, though bedeviled, and despite a ton of bad luck, Despite giving up on the human race, saying, \u201cThey're all liars and cheats.\u201d", "12-19": "What can I give back to God for the blessings he's poured out on me? I'll lift high the cup of salvation\u2014a toast to God! I'll pray in the name of God; I'll complete what I promised God I'd do, and I'll do it together with his people. When they arrive at the gates of death, God welcomes those who love him. Oh, God, here I am, your servant, your faithful servant: set me free for your service! I'm ready to offer the thanksgiving sacrifice and pray in the name of God. I'll complete what I promised God I'd do, and I'll do it in company with his people, In the place of worship, in God's house, in Jerusalem, God's city. Hallelujah!"}

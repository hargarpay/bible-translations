{"1-3": "A white-tailed deer drinks from the creek; I want to drink God, deep draughts of God. I'm thirsty for God-alive. I wonder, \u201cWill I ever make it\u2014 arrive and drink in God's presence?\u201d I'm on a diet of tears\u2014 tears for breakfast, tears for supper. All day long people knock at my door, Pestering, \u201cWhere is this God of yours?\u201d", "4": "These are the things I go over and over, emptying out the pockets of my life. I was always at the head of the worshiping crowd, right out in front, Leading them all, eager to arrive and worship, Shouting praises, singing thanksgiving\u2014 celebrating, all of us, God's feast!", "5": "Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on God\u2014 soon I'll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He's my God.", "6-8": "When my soul is in the dumps, I rehearse everything I know of you, From Jordan depths to Hermon heights, including Mount Mizar. Chaos calls to chaos, to the tune of whitewater rapids. Your breaking surf, your thundering breakers crash and crush me. Then God promises to love me all day, sing songs all through the night! My life is God's prayer.", "9-10": "Sometimes I ask God, my rock-solid God, \u201cWhy did you let me down? Why am I walking around in tears, harassed by enemies?\u201d They're out for the kill, these tormentors with their obscenities, Taunting day after day, \u201cWhere is this God of yours?\u201d", "11": "Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on God\u2014 soon I'll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He's my God."}

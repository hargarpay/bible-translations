{"1": "I give you all the credit, God\u2014 you got me out of that mess, you didn't let my foes gloat.", "2-3": "God, my God, I yelled for help and you put me together. God, you pulled me out of the grave, gave me another chance at life when I was down-and-out.", "4-5": "All you saints! Sing your hearts out to God! Thank him to his face! He gets angry once in a while, but across a lifetime there is only love. The nights of crying your eyes out give way to days of laughter.", "6-7": "When things were going great I crowed, \u201cI've got it made. I'm God's favorite. He made me king of the mountain.\u201d Then you looked the other way and I fell to pieces.", "8-10": "I called out to you, God; I laid my case before you: \u201cCan you sell me for a profit when I'm dead? auction me off at a cemetery yard sale? When I'm 'dust to dust' my songs and stories of you won't sell. So listen! and be kind! Help me out of this!\u201d", "11-12": "You did it: you changed wild lament into whirling dance; You ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers. I'm about to burst with song; I can't keep quiet about you. God, my God, I can't thank you enough."}

{"1-5": "God, don't shut me out; don't give me the silent treatment, O God. Your enemies are out there whooping it up, the God-haters are living it up; They're plotting to do your people in, conspiring to rob you of your precious ones. \u201cLet's wipe this nation from the face of the earth,\u201d they say; \u201cscratch Israel's name off the books.\u201d And now they're putting their heads together, making plans to get rid of you.", "6-8": "Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia and the Tyrians, And now Assyria has joined up, Giving muscle to the gang of Lot.", "9-12": "Do to them what you did to Midian, to Sisera and Jabin at Kishon Brook; They came to a bad end at Endor, nothing but dung for the garden. Cut down their leaders as you did Oreb and Zeeb, their princes to nothings like Zebah and Zalmunna, With their empty brags, \u201cWe're grabbing it all, grabbing God's gardens for ourselves.\u201d", "13-18": "My God! I've had it with them! Blow them away! Tumbleweeds in the desert waste, charred sticks in the burned-over ground. Knock the breath right out of them, so they're gasping for breath, gasping, \u201cGod.\u201d Bring them to the end of their rope, and leave them there dangling, helpless. Then they'll learn your name: \u201cGod,\u201d the one and only High God on earth."}

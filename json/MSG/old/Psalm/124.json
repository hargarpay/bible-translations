He didn't go off and leave us. He didn't abandon us defenseless, helpless as a rabbit in a pack of snarling dogs.", "7": "We've flown free from their fangs, free of their traps, free as a bird. Their grip is broken; we're free as a bird in flight.", "8": "God's strong name is our help, the same God who made heaven and earth."}

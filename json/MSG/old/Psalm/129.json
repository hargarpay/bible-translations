{"1-4": "\u201cThey've kicked me around ever since I was young\u201d \u2014this is how Israel tells it\u2014 \u201cThey've kicked me around ever since I was young, but they never could keep me down. Their plowmen plowed long furrows up and down my back; Then God ripped the harnesses of the evil plowmen to shreds.\u201d", "5-8": "Oh, let all those who hate Zion grovel in humiliation; Let them be like grass in shallow ground that withers before the harvest, Before the farmhands can gather it in, the harvesters get in the crop, Before the neighbors have a chance to call out, \u201cCongratulations on your wonderful crop! We bless you in God's name!\u201d"}

{"1-3": "I waited and waited and waited for God. At last he looked; finally he listened. He lifted me out of the ditch, pulled me from deep mud. He stood me up on a solid rock to make sure I wouldn't slip. He taught me how to sing the latest God-song, a praise-song to our God. More and more people are seeing this: they enter the mystery, abandoning themselves to God.", "4-5": "Blessed are you who give yourselves over to God, turn your backs on the world's \u201csure thing,\u201d ignore what the world worships; The world's a huge stockpile of God-wonders and God-thoughts. Nothing and no one comes close to you! I start talking about you, telling what I know, and quickly run out of words. Neither numbers nor words account for you.", "6": "Doing something for you, bringing something to you\u2014 that's not what you're after. Being religious, acting pious\u2014 that's not what you're asking for. You've opened my ears so I can listen.", "7-8": "So I answered, \u201cI'm coming. I read in your letter what you wrote about me, And I'm coming to the party you're throwing for me.\u201d That's when God's Word entered my life, became part of my very being.", "9-10": "I've preached you to the whole congregation, I've kept back nothing, God\u2014you know that. I didn't keep the news of your ways a secret, didn't keep it to myself. I told it all, how dependable you are, how thorough. I didn't hold back pieces of love and truth For myself alone. I told it all, let the congregation know the whole story.", "11-12": "Now God, don't hold out on me, don't hold back your passion. Your love and truth are all that keeps me together. When troubles ganged up on me, a mob of sins past counting, I was so swamped by guilt I couldn't see my way clear. More guilt in my heart than hair on my head, so heavy the guilt that my heart gave out.", "13-15": "Soften up, God, and intervene; hurry and get me some help, So those who are trying to kidnap my soul will be embarrassed and lose face, So anyone who gets a kick out of making me miserable will be heckled and disgraced, So those who pray for my ruin will be booed and jeered without mercy.", "16-17": "But all who are hunting for you\u2014 oh, let them sing and be happy. Let those who know what you're all about tell the world you're great and not quitting. And me? I'm a mess. I'm nothing and have nothing: make something of me. You can do it; you've got what it takes\u2014 but God, don't put it off."}

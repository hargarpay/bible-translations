{"1-3": "God is a safe place to hide, ready to help when we need him. We stand fearless at the cliff-edge of doom, courageous in seastorm and earthquake, Before the rush and roar of oceans, the tremors that shift mountains. Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, God-of-Angel-Armies protects us.", "4-6": "River fountains splash joy, cooling God's city, this sacred haunt of the Most High. God lives here, the streets are safe, God at your service from crack of dawn. Godless nations rant and rave, kings and kingdoms threaten, but Earth does anything he says.", "7": "Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, God-of-Angel-Armies protects us.", "8-10": "Attention, all! See the marvels of God! He plants flowers and trees all over the earth, Bans war from pole to pole, breaks all the weapons across his knee. \u201cStep out of the traffic! Take a long, loving look at me, your High God, above politics, above everything.\u201d", "11": "Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, God-of-Angel-Armies protects us."}

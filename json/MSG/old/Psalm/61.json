When I'm far from anywhere, down to my last gasp, I call out, \u201cGuide me up High Rock Mountain!\u201d", "3-5": "You've always given me breathing room, a place to get away from it all, A lifetime pass to your safe-house, an open invitation as your guest. You've always taken me seriously, God, made me welcome among those who know and love you.", "6-8": "Let the days of the king add up to years and years of good rule. Set his throne in the full light of God; post Steady Love and Good Faith as lookouts, And I'll be the poet who sings your glory\u2014 and live what I sing every day."}

{"1-2": "Long enough, God\u2014 you've ignored me long enough. I've looked at the back of your head long enough. Long enough I've carried this ton of trouble, lived with a stomach full of pain. Long enough my arrogant enemies have looked down their noses at me.", "3-4": "Take a good look at me, God, my God; I want to look life in the eye, So no enemy can get the best of me or laugh when I fall on my face.", "5-6": "I've thrown myself headlong into your arms\u2014 I'm celebrating your rescue. I'm singing at the top of my lungs, I'm so full of answered prayers."}

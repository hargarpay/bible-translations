And now we're here, O Jerusalem, inside Jerusalem's walls!", "3-5": "Jerusalem, well-built city, built as a place for worship! The city to which the tribes ascend, all God's tribes go up to worship, To give thanks to the name of God\u2014 this is what it means to be Israel. Thrones for righteous judgment are set there, famous David-thrones.", "6-9": "Pray for Jerusalem's peace! Prosperity to all you Jerusalem-lovers! Friendly insiders, get along! Hostile outsiders, keep your distance! For the sake of my family and friends, I say it again: live in peace! For the sake of the house of our God, God, I'll do my very best for you."}

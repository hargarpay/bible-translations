{"1-6": "Bildad the Shuhite again attacked Job: \u201cGod is sovereign, God is fearsome\u2014 everything in the cosmos fits and works in his plan. Can anyone count his angel armies? Is there any place where his light doesn't shine? How can a mere mortal presume to stand up to God? How can an ordinary person pretend to be guiltless? Why, even the moon has its flaws, even the stars aren't perfect in God's eyes, So how much less, plain men and women\u2014 slugs and maggots by comparison!\u201d"}

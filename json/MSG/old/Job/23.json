If I knew where on earth to find him, I'd go straight to him. I'd lay my case before him face-to-face, give him all my arguments firsthand. I'd find out exactly what he's thinking, discover what's going on in his head. Do you think he'd dismiss me or bully me? No, he'd take me seriously. He'd see a straight-living man standing before him; my Judge would acquit me for good of all charges.", "8-9": "\u201cI travel East looking for him\u2014I find no one; then West, but not a trace; I go North, but he's hidden his tracks; then South, but not even a glimpse.", "10-12": "\u201cBut he knows where I am and what I've done. He can cross-examine me all he wants, and I'll pass the test with honors. I've followed him closely, my feet in his footprints, not once swerving from his way.

He does what he wants, when he wants to. He'll complete in detail what he's decided about me, and whatever else he determines to do. Is it any wonder that I dread meeting him? Whenever I think about it, I get scared all over again. God makes my heart sink! God Almighty gives me the shudders! I'm completely in the dark, I can't see my hand in front of my face.\u201d"}

{"1-6": "Job answered: \u201cHow long are you going to keep battering away at me, pounding me with these harangues? Time after time after time you jump all over me. Do you have no conscience, abusing me like this? Even if I have, somehow or other, gotten off the track, what business is that of yours? Why do you insist on putting me down, using my troubles as a stick to beat me? Tell it to God\u2014he's the one behind all this, he's the one who dragged me into this mess.", "7-12": "\u201cLook at me\u2014I shout 'Murder!' and I'm ignored; I call for help and no one bothers to stop. God threw a barricade across my path\u2014I'm stymied; he turned out all the lights\u2014I'm stuck in the dark. He destroyed my reputation, robbed me of all self-respect. He tore me apart piece by piece\u2014I'm ruined! Then he yanked out hope by the roots. He's angry with me\u2014oh, how he's angry! He treats me like his worst enemy. He has launched a major campaign against me, using every weapon he can think of, coming at me from all sides at once.", "13-20": "\u201cGod alienated my family from me; everyone who knows me avoids me. My relatives and friends have all left; houseguests forget I ever existed. The servant girls treat me like a bum off the street, look at me like they've never seen me before. I call my attendant and he ignores me, ignores me even though I plead with him. My wife can't stand to be around me anymore. I'm repulsive to my family. Even street urchins despise me; when I come out, they taunt and jeer. Everyone I've ever been close to abhors me; my dearest loved ones reject me. I'm nothing but a bag of bones; my life hangs by a thread.", "21-22": "\u201cOh, friends, dear friends, take pity on me. God has come down hard on me! Do you have to be hard on me, too? Don't you ever tire of abusing me?", "23-27": "\u201cIf only my words were written in a book\u2014 better yet, chiseled in stone! Still, I know that God lives\u2014the One who gives me back my life\u2014 and eventually he'll take his stand on earth. And I'll see him\u2014even though I get skinned alive!\u2014 see God myself, with my very own eyes. Oh, how I long for that day!", "28-29": "\u201cIf you're thinking, 'How can we get through to him, get him to see that his trouble is all his own fault?' Forget it. Start worrying about yourselves. Worry about your own sins and God's coming judgment, for judgment is most certainly on the way.\u201d"}

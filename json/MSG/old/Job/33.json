The Spirit of God made me what I am, the breath of God Almighty gave me life!", "5-7": "\u201cAnd if you think you can prove me wrong, do it. Lay out your arguments. Stand up for yourself! Look, I'm human\u2014no better than you; we're both made of the same kind of mud. So let's work this through together; don't let my aggressiveness overwhelm you.", "8-11": "\u201cHere's what you said. I heard you say it with my own ears. You said, 'I'm pure\u2014I've done nothing wrong. Believe me, I'm clean\u2014my conscience is clear. But God keeps picking on me; he treats me like I'm his enemy. He's thrown me in jail; he keeps me under constant surveillance.'", "12-14": "\u201cBut let me tell you, Job, you're wrong, dead wrong! God is far greater than any human.

Before you know it, you're healed, the very picture of health!", "26-28": "\u201cOr, you may fall on your knees and pray\u2014to God's delight! You'll see God's smile and celebrate, finding yourself set right with God. You'll sing God's praises to everyone you meet, testifying, 'I messed up my life\u2014 and let me tell you, it wasn't worth it. But God stepped in and saved me from certain death. I'm alive again! Once more I see the light!'", "29-30": "\u201cThis is the way God works.

Don't interrupt\u2014I'm not finished yet. But if you think of anything I should know, tell me. There's nothing I'd like better than to see your name cleared. Meanwhile, keep listening. Don't distract me with interruptions. I'm going to teach you the basics of wisdom.\u201d"}

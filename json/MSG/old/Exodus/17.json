Any minute now they'll kill me!\u201d", "5-6": "God said to Moses, \u201cGo on out ahead of the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel. Take the staff you used to strike the Nile.

Water will gush out of it and the people will drink.\u201d", "6-7": "Moses did what he said, with the elders of Israel right there watching.

He sat on it and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on each side. So his hands remained steady until the sun went down. Joshua defeated Amalek and its army in battle.", "14": "God said to Moses, \u201cWrite this up as a reminder to Joshua, to keep it before him, because I will most certainly wipe the very memory of Amalek off the face of the Earth.\u201d", "15-16": "Moses built an altar and named it \u201cGod My Banner.\u201d He said, Salute God's rule!

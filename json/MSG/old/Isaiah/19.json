The god-idols of Egypt shudder and shake, Egyptians paralyzed by panic.", "2-4": "God says, \u201cI'll make Egyptian fight Egyptian, brother fight brother, neighbor fight neighbor, City fight city, kingdom fight kingdom\u2014 anarchy and chaos and killing! I'll knock the wind out of the Egyptians. They won't know coming from going. They'll go to their god-idols for answers; they'll conjure ghosts and hold s\u00e9ances, desperate for answers. But I'll turn the Egyptians over to a tyrant most cruel. I'll put them under the rule of a mean, merciless king.\u201d Decree of the Master, God-of-the-Angel-Armies.", "5-10": "The River Nile will dry up, the riverbed baked dry in the sun. The canals will become stagnant and stink, every stream touching the Nile dry up.

Textile workers will be out of work, all weavers and workers in linen and cotton and wool Dispirited, depressed in their forced idleness\u2014 everyone who works for a living, jobless.", "11-15": "The princes of Zoan are fools, the advisors of Pharaoh stupid. How could any of you dare tell Pharaoh, \u201cTrust me: I'm wise. I know what's going on. Why, I'm descended from the old wisdom of Egypt\u201d? There's not a wise man or woman left in the country. If there were, one of them would tell you what God-of-the-Angel-Armies has in mind for Egypt. As it is, the princes of Zoan are all fools and the princes of Memphis, dunces. The honored pillars of your society have led Egypt into detours and dead ends. God has scrambled their brains, Egypt's become a falling-down-in-his-own-vomit drunk. Egypt's hopeless, past helping, a senile, doddering old fool.", "16-17": "On that Day, Egyptians will be like hysterical schoolgirls, screaming at the first hint of action from God-of-the-Angel-Armies. Little Judah will strike terror in Egyptians! Say \u201cJudah\u201d to an Egyptian and see panic.

It will show how the God-of-the-Angel-Armies has helped the Egyptians. When they cry out in prayer to God because of oppressors, he'll send them help, a savior who will keep them safe and take care of them. God will openly show himself to the Egyptians and they'll get to know him on that Day. They'll worship him seriously with sacrifices and burnt offerings. They'll make vows and keep them.

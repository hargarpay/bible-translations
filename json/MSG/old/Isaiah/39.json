{"1": "Sometime later, King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent messengers with greetings and a gift to Hezekiah. He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and was now well.", "2": "Hezekiah received the messengers warmly. He took them on a tour of his royal precincts, proudly showing them all his treasures: silver, gold, spices, expensive oils, all his weapons\u2014everything out on display. There was nothing in his house or kingdom that Hezekiah didn't show them.", "3": "Later the prophet Isaiah showed up. He asked Hezekiah, \u201cWhat were these men up to? What did they say? And where did they come from?\u201d Hezekiah said, \u201cThey came from a long way off, from Babylon.\u201d", "4": "\u201cAnd what did they see in your palace?\u201d \u201cEverything,\u201d said Hezekiah. \u201cI showed them the works, opened all the doors and impressed them with it all.\u201d", "5-7": "Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, \u201cNow listen to this Message from God-of-the-Angel-Armies: I have to warn you, the time is coming when everything in this palace, along with everything your ancestors accumulated before you, will be hauled off to Babylon. God says that there will be nothing left. Nothing. And not only your things but your sons. Some of your sons will be taken into exile, ending up as eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.\u201d", "8": "Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, \u201cGood. If God says so, it's good.\u201d Within himself he was thinking, \u201cBut surely nothing bad will happen in my lifetime. I'll enjoy peace and stability as long as I live.\u201d"}

{"1-8": "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Master sitting on a throne\u2014high, exalted!\u2014and the train of his robes filled the Temple. Angel-seraphs hovered above him, each with six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two their feet, and with two they flew. And they called back and forth one to the other, Holy, Holy, Holy is God-of-the-Angel-Armies. His bright glory fills the whole earth. The foundations trembled at the sound of the angel voices, and then the whole house filled with smoke. I said, \u201cDoom! It's Doomsday! I'm as good as dead! Every word I've ever spoken is tainted\u2014 blasphemous even! And the people I live with talk the same way, using words that corrupt and desecrate. And here I've looked God in the face! The King! God-of-the-Angel-Armies!\u201d Then one of the angel-seraphs flew to me. He held a live coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. He touched my mouth with the coal and said, \u201cLook. This coal has touched your lips. Gone your guilt, your sins wiped out.\u201d And then I heard the voice of the Master: \u201cWhom shall I send? Who will go for us?\u201d I spoke up, \u201cI'll go. Send me!\u201d", "9-10": "He said, \u201cGo and tell this people: \u201c'Listen hard, but you aren't going to get it; look hard, but you won't catch on.' Make these people blockheads, with fingers in their ears and blindfolds on their eyes, So they won't see a thing, won't hear a word, So they won't have a clue about what's going on and, yes, so they won't turn around and be made whole.\u201d", "11-13": "Astonished, I said, \u201cAnd Master, how long is this to go on?\u201d He said, \u201cUntil the cities are emptied out, not a soul left in the cities\u2014 Houses empty of people, countryside empty of people. Until I, God, get rid of everyone, sending them off, the land totally empty. And even if some should survive, say a tenth, the devastation will start up again. The country will look like pine and oak forest with every tree cut down\u2014 Every tree a stump, a huge field of stumps. But there's a holy seed in those stumps.\u201d"}

So why is the god Milcom taking over Gad's land, his followers moving into its towns? But not for long! The time's coming\u201d \u2014God's Decree\u2014 \u201cWhen I'll fill the ears of Rabbah, Ammon's big city, with battle cries. She'll end up a pile of rubble, all her towns burned to the ground. Then Israel will kick out the invaders. I, God, say so, and it will be so. Wail Heshbon, Ai is in ruins. Villages of Rabbah, wring your hands! Dress in mourning, weep buckets of tears. Go into hysterics, run around in circles! Your god Milcom will be hauled off to exile, and all his priests and managers right with him. Why do you brag of your once-famous strength? You're a broken-down has-been, a castoff Who fondles his trophies and dreams of glory days and vainly thinks, 'No one can lay a hand on me.' Well, think again. I'll face you with terror from all sides.\u201d Word of the Master, God-of-the-Angel-Armies. \u201cYou'll be stampeded headlong, with no one to round up the runaways.

Has their wisdom gone wormy and rotten? Run for your lives! Get out while you can! Find a good place to hide, you who live in Dedan! I'm bringing doom to Esau. It's time to settle accounts. When harvesters work your fields, don't they leave gleanings? When burglars break into your house, don't they take only what they want? But I'll strip Esau clean. I'll search out every nook and cranny. I'll destroy everything connected with him, children and relatives and neighbors. There'll be no one left who will be able to say, 'I'll take care of your orphans. Your widows can depend on me.'\u201d", "12-13": "Indeed.

Oh yes, you'll drink every drop. And as for Bozrah, your capital, I swear by all that I am\u201d\u2014God's Decree\u2014\u201cthat that city will end up a pile of charred ruins, a stinking garbage dump, an obscenity\u2014and all her daughter-cities with her.\u201d", "14": "I've just heard the latest from God.

Believe it or not, the flock in shock, helpless to help, will watch it happen. The very earth will shudder because of their cries, cries of anguish heard at the distant Red Sea. Look!

I'll blow them away in all directions, landing homeless Elamites in every country on earth. They'll live in constant fear and terror among enemies who want to kill them. I'll bring doom on them, my anger-fueled doom. I'll set murderous hounds on their heels until there's nothing left of them.

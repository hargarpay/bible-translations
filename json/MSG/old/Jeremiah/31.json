Israel, out looking for a place to rest, met God out looking for them!\u201d God told them, \u201cI've never quit loving you and never will. Expect love, love, and more love! And so now I'll start over with you and build you up again, dear virgin Israel. You'll resume your singing, grabbing tambourines and joining the dance. You'll go back to your old work of planting vineyards on the Samaritan hillsides, And sit back and enjoy the fruit\u2014 oh, how you'll enjoy those harvests! The time's coming when watchmen will call out from the hilltops of Ephraim: 'On your feet! Let's go to Zion, go to meet our God!'\u201d", "7": "Oh yes, God says so: \u201cShout for joy at the top of your lungs for Jacob! Announce the good news to the number-one nation! Raise cheers! Sing praises. Say, 'God has saved his people, saved the core of Israel.'", "8": "\u201cWatch what comes next: \u201cI'll bring my people back from the north country And gather them up from the ends of the earth, gather those who've gone blind And those who are lame and limping, gather pregnant women, Even the mothers whose birth pangs have started, bring them all back, a huge crowd!", "9": "\u201cWatch them come! They'll come weeping for joy as I take their hands and lead them, Lead them to fresh flowing brooks, lead them along smooth, uncluttered paths. Yes, it's because I'm Israel's Father and Ephraim's my firstborn son!", "10-14": "\u201cHear this, nations! God's Message! Broadcast this all over the world! Tell them, 'The One who scattered Israel will gather them together again. From now on he'll keep a careful eye on them, like a shepherd with his flock.' I, God, will pay a stiff ransom price for Jacob; I'll free him from the grip of the Babylonian bully. The people will climb up Zion's slopes shouting with joy, their faces beaming because of God's bounty\u2014 Grain and wine and oil, flocks of sheep, herds of cattle. Their lives will be like a well-watered garden, never again left to dry up. Young women will dance and be happy, young men and old men will join in. I'll convert their weeping into laughter, lavishing comfort, invading their grief with joy. I'll make sure that their priests get three square meals a day and that my people have more than enough.'\u201d God's Decree.", "15-17": "Again, God's Message: \u201cListen to this! Laments coming out of Ramah, wild and bitter weeping. It's Rachel weeping for her children, Rachel refusing all solace. Her children are gone, gone\u2014long gone into exile.\u201d But God says, \u201cStop your incessant weeping, hold back your tears. Collect wages from your grief work.\u201d God's Decree. \u201cThey'll be coming back home! There's hope for your children.\u201d God's Decree.", "18-19": "\u201cI've heard the contrition of Ephraim. Yes, I've heard it clearly, saying, 'You trained me well. You broke me, a wild yearling horse, to the saddle. Now put me, trained and obedient, to use. You are my God. After those years of running loose, I repented. After you trained me to obedience, I was ashamed of my past, my wild, unruly past. Humiliated, I beat on my chest. Will I ever live this down?'", "20": "\u201cOh! Ephraim is my dear, dear son, my child in whom I take pleasure! Every time I mention his name, my heart bursts with longing for him! Everything in me cries out for him. Softly and tenderly I wait for him.\u201d God's Decree.", "21-22": "\u201cSet up signposts to mark your trip home. Get a good map. Study the road conditions. The road out is the road back. Come back, dear virgin Israel, come back to your hometowns. How long will you flit here and there, indecisive? How long before you make up your fickle mind? God will create a new thing in this land: A transformed woman will embrace the transforming God!\u201d", "23-24": "A Message from Israel's God-of-the-Angel-Armies: \u201cWhen I've turned everything around and brought my people back, the old expressions will be heard on the streets: 'God bless you!'\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 'O True Home!'\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 'O Holy Mountain!'

You eat green apples, you're the one who gets sick.", "31-32": "\u201cThat's right. The time is coming when I will make a brand-new covenant with Israel and Judah. It won't be a repeat of the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. They broke that covenant even though I did my part as their Master.\u201d God's Decree.", "33-34": "\u201cThis is the brand-new covenant that I will make with Israel when the time comes. I will put my law within them\u2014write it on their hearts!\u2014and be their God. And they will be my people. They will no longer go around setting up schools to teach each other about God. They'll know me firsthand, the dull and the bright, the smart and the slow. I'll wipe the slate clean for each of them. I'll forget they ever sinned!\u201d God's Decree.", "35": "God's Message, from the God who lights up the day with sun and brightens the night with moon and stars, Who whips the ocean into a billowy froth, whose name is God-of-the-Angel-Armies:", "36": "\u201cIf this ordered cosmos ever fell to pieces, fell into chaos before me\u201d\u2014God's Decree\u2014 \u201cThen and only then might Israel fall apart and disappear as a nation before me.\u201d", "37": "God's Message: \u201cIf the skies could be measured with a yardstick and the earth explored to its core, Then and only then would I turn my back on Israel, disgusted with all they've done.\u201d God's Decree.", "38-40": "\u201cThe time is coming\u201d\u2014it's God's Decree\u2014\u201cwhen God's city will be rebuilt, rebuilt all the way from the Citadel of Hanamel to the Corner Gate. The master plan will extend west to Gareb Hill and then around to Goath. The whole valley to the south where incinerated corpses are dumped\u2014a death valley if there ever was one!\u2014and all the terraced fields out to the Brook Kidron on the east as far north as the Horse Gate will be consecrated to me as a holy place. \u201cThis city will never again be torn down or destroyed.\u201d"}

{"1-4": "The Message of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah of the family of priests who lived in Anathoth in the country of Benjamin. God's Message began to come to him during the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amos reigned over Judah. It continued to come to him during the time Jehoiakim son of Josiah reigned over Judah. And it continued to come to him clear down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah over Judah, the year that Jerusalem was taken into exile. This is what God said:", "5": "\u201cBefore I shaped you in the womb, I knew all about you. Before you saw the light of day, I had holy plans for you: A prophet to the nations\u2014 that's what I had in mind for you.\u201d", "6": "But I said, \u201cHold it, Master God! Look at me. I don't know anything. I'm only a boy!\u201d", "7-8": "God told me, \u201cDon't say, 'I'm only a boy.' I'll tell you where to go and you'll go there. I'll tell you what to say and you'll say it. Don't be afraid of a soul. I'll be right there, looking after you.\u201d God's Decree.", "9-10": "God reached out, touched my mouth, and said, \u201cLook! I've just put my words in your mouth\u2014hand-delivered! See what I've done? I've given you a job to do among nations and governments\u2014a red-letter day! Your job is to pull up and tear down, take apart and demolish, And then start over, building and planting.\u201d", "11-12": "God's Message came to me: \u201cWhat do you see, Jeremiah?\u201d I said, \u201cA walking stick\u2014that's all.\u201d And God said, \u201cGood eyes! I'm sticking with you. I'll make every word I give you come true.\u201d", "13-15": "God's Message came again: \u201cSo what do you see now?\u201d I said, \u201cI see a boiling pot, tipped down toward us.\u201d Then God told me, \u201cDisaster will pour out of the north on everyone living in this land. Watch for this: I'm calling all the kings out of the north.\u201d God's Decree.", "15-16": "\u201cThey'll come and set up headquarters facing Jerusalem's gates, Facing all the city walls, facing all the villages of Judah. I'll pronounce my judgment on the people of Judah for walking out on me\u2014what a terrible thing to do!\u2014 And courting other gods with their offerings, worshiping as gods sticks they'd carved, stones they'd painted.", "17": "\u201cBut you\u2014up on your feet and get dressed for work! Stand up and say your piece. Say exactly what I tell you to say. Don't pull your punches or I'll pull you out of the lineup.", "18-19": "\u201cStand at attention while I prepare you for your work. I'm making you as impregnable as a castle, Immovable as a steel post, solid as a concrete block wall. You're a one-man defense system against this culture, Against Judah's kings and princes, against the priests and local leaders. They'll fight you, but they won't even scratch you. I'll back you up every inch of the way.\u201d God's Decree."}

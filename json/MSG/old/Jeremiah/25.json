And you haven't listened to a word of it!", "4-6": "Not only that but God also sent a steady stream of prophets to you who were just as persistent as me, and you never listened. They told you, \u201cTurn back\u2014right now, each one of you!\u2014from your evil way of life and bad behavior, and live in the land God gave you and your ancestors, the land he intended to give you forever.

I'm devoting the whole works to total destruction\u2014a horror to top all the horrors in history.

The peaceful sheepfolds will be silent with death, silenced by God's deadly anger. God will come out into the open like a lion leaping from its cover, And the country will be torn to pieces, ripped and ravaged by his anger."}

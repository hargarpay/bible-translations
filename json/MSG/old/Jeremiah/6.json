Doom pours out of the north\u2014 massive terror! I have likened my dear daughter Zion to a lovely meadow. Well, now 'shepherds' from the north have discovered her and brought in their flocks of soldiers. They've pitched camp all around her, and plan where they'll 'graze.' And then, 'Prepare to attack! The fight is on! To arms! We'll strike at noon! Oh, it's too late? Day is dying? Evening shadows are upon us? Well, up anyway! We'll attack by night and tear apart her defenses stone by stone.'\u201d", "6-8": "God-of-the-Angel-Armies gave the orders: \u201cChop down her trees. Build a siege ramp against Jerusalem, A city full of brutality, bursting with violence. Just as a well holds a good supply of water, she supplies wickedness nonstop. The streets echo the cries: 'Violence! Rape!' Victims, bleeding and moaning, lie all over the place. You're in deep trouble, Jerusalem. You've pushed me to the limit. You're on the brink of being wiped out, being turned into a ghost town.\u201d", "9": "More orders from God-of-the-Angel-Armies: \u201cTime's up! Harvest the grapes for judgment.

Will anyone notice? It's hopeless! Their ears are stuffed with wax\u2014 deaf as a post, blind as a bat. It's hopeless! They've tuned out God. They don't want to hear from me. But I'm bursting with the wrath of God. I can't hold it in much longer.", "11-12": "\u201cSo dump it on the children in the streets. Let it loose on the gangs of youth. For no one's exempt: Husbands and wives will be taken, the old and those ready to die; Their homes will be given away\u2014 all they own, even their loved ones\u2014 When I give the signal against all who live in this country.\u201d God's Decree.", "13-15": "\u201cEveryone's after the dishonest dollar, little people and big people alike.

But things are not 'just fine'! Do you suppose they are embarrassed over this outrage? No, they have no shame. They don't even know how to blush. There's no hope for them. They've hit bottom and there's no getting up. As far as I'm concerned, they're finished.\u201d God has spoken.", "16-20": "God's Message yet again: \u201cGo stand at the crossroads and look around. Ask for directions to the old road, The tried-and-true road. Then take it. Discover the right route for your souls. But they said, 'Nothing doing. We aren't going that way.' I even provided watchmen for them to warn them, to set off the alarm. But the people said, 'It's a false alarm. It doesn't concern us.' And so I'm calling in the nations as witnesses: 'Watch, witnesses, what happens to them!' And, 'Pay attention, Earth! Don't miss these bulletins.' I'm visiting catastrophe on this people, the end result of the games they've been playing with me. They've ignored everything I've said, had nothing but contempt for my teaching.

Nothing can refine evil out of them. Men will give up and call them 'slag,' thrown on the slag heap by me, their God.\u201d"}

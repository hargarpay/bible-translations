I have signed the death warrant on all the children born in this country, the mothers who bear them and the fathers who beget them\u2014an epidemic of death. Death unlamented, the dead unburied, dead bodies decomposing and stinking like dung, all the killed and starved corpses served up as meals for carrion crows and mongrel dogs!\u201d", "5-7": "God continued: \u201cDon't enter a house where there's mourning. Don't go to the funeral. Don't sympathize. I've quit caring about what happens to this people.\u201d God's Decree. \u201cNo more loyal love on my part, no more compassion. The famous and obscure will die alike here, unlamented and unburied. No funerals will be conducted, no one will give them a second thought, no one will care, no one will say, 'I'm sorry,' no one will so much as offer a cup of tea, not even for the mother or father.", "8": "\u201cAnd if there happens to be a feast celebrated, don't go there either to enjoy the festivities.\u201d", "9": "God-of-the-Angel-Armies, the God of Israel, says, \u201cWatch this!

We're not criminals, after all. What have we done to our God to be treated like this?' tell them this: 'It's because your ancestors left me, walked off and never looked back. They took up with the no-gods, worshiped and doted on them, and ignored me and wouldn't do a thing I told them. And you're even worse! Take a good look in the mirror\u2014each of you doing whatever you want, whenever you want, refusing to pay attention to me. And for this I'm getting rid of you, throwing you out in the cold, into a far and strange country. You can worship your precious no-gods there to your heart's content. Rest assured, I won't bother you anymore.'", "14-15": "\u201cOn the other hand, don't miss this: The time is coming when no one will say any longer, 'As sure as God lives, the God who delivered Israel from Egypt.'

I haven't lost track of a single one of them, neither them nor their sins.", "18": "\u201cThey won't get by with a thing. They'll pay double for everything they did wrong.

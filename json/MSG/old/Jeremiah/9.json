{"1-2": "I wish my head were a well of water and my eyes fountains of tears So I could weep day and night for casualties among my dear, dear people. At times I wish I had a wilderness hut, a backwoods cabin, Where I could get away from my people and never see them again. They're a faithless, feckless bunch, a congregation of degenerates.", "3-6": "\u201cTheir tongues shoot out lies like a bow shoots arrows\u2014 A mighty army of liars, the sworn enemies of truth. They advance from one evil to the next, ignorant of me.\u201d God's Decree. \u201cBe wary of even longtime neighbors. Don't even trust your grandmother! Brother schemes against brother, like old cheating Jacob. Friend against friend spreads malicious gossip. Neighbors gyp neighbors, never telling the truth. They've trained their tongues to tell lies, and now they can't tell the truth. They pile wrong upon wrong, stack lie upon lie, and refuse to know me.\u201d God's Decree.", "7-9": "Therefore, God-of-the-Angel-Armies says: \u201cWatch this! I'll melt them down and see what they're made of. What else can I do with a people this wicked? Their tongues are poison arrows! Deadly lies stream from their mouths. Neighbor greets neighbor with a smile, 'Good morning! How're things?' while scheming to do away with him. Do you think I'm going to stand around and do nothing?\u201d God's Decree. \u201cDon't you think I'll take serious measures against a people like this?", "10-11": "\u201cI'm lamenting the loss of the mountain pastures. I'm chanting dirges for the old grazing grounds. They've become deserted wastelands too dangerous for travelers. No sounds of sheep bleating or cattle mooing. Birds and wild animals, all gone. Nothing stirring, no sounds of life. I'm going to make Jerusalem a pile of rubble, fit for nothing but stray cats and dogs. I'm going to reduce Judah's towns to piles of ruins where no one lives!\u201d", "12": "I asked, \u201cIs there anyone around bright enough to tell us what's going on here? Anyone who has the inside story from God and can let us in on it? \u201cWhy is the country wasted? \u201cWhy no travelers in this desert?\u201d", "13-15": "God's answer: \u201cBecause they abandoned my plain teaching. They wouldn't listen to anything I said, refused to live the way I told them to. Instead they lived any way they wanted and took up with the Baal gods, who they thought would give them what they wanted\u2014following the example of their parents.\u201d And this is the consequence.

Send for some singers who can help us mourn our loss. Tell them to hurry\u2014 to help us express our loss and lament, Help us get our tears flowing, make tearful music of our crying. Listen to it!

Oh, listen to God's Message! Open your ears. Take in what he says. Teach your daughters songs for the dead and your friends the songs of heartbreak.

Don't let heroes brag of their exploits. Don't let the rich brag of their riches. If you brag, brag of this and this only: That you understand and know me. I'm God, and I act in loyal love. I do what's right and set things right and fair, and delight in those who do the same things. These are my trademarks.\u201d God's Decree.", "25-26": "\u201cStay alert!

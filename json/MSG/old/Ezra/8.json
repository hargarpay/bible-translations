We camped there three days. I looked them over and found that they were all laymen and priests but no Levites. So I sent for the leaders Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, and for the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan. I then sent them to Iddo, who is head of the town of Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives who lived there in Casiphia: \u201cSend us ministers for The Temple of God.\u201d", "18-20": "Well, the generous hand of our God was on us, and they brought back to us a wise man from the family of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel.

They were all signed up by name.", "21-22": "I proclaimed a fast there beside the Ahava Canal, a fast to humble ourselves before our God and pray for wise guidance for our journey\u2014all our people and possessions.

And he listened.", "24-27": "Then I picked twelve of the leading priests\u2014Sherebiah and Hashabiah with ten of their brothers. I weighed out for them the silver, the gold, the vessels, and the offerings for The Temple of our God that the king, his advisors, and all the Israelites had given: tons of silver vessels of silver valued at three and three-quarter tons of gold gold bowls weighing eighteen and a half pounds vessels of bright red copper, as valuable as gold.", "28-29": "I said to them, \u201cYou are holy to God and these vessels are holy.

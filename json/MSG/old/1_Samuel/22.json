He was sitting under the big oak on the hill at Gibeah at the time, spear in hand, holding court surrounded by his officials. He said, \u201cListen here, you Benjaminites! Don't think for a minute that you have any future with the son of Jesse! Do you think he's going to hand over choice land, give you all influential jobs? Think again. Here you are, conspiring against me, whispering behind my back\u2014not one of you is man enough to tell me that my own son is making deals with the son of Jesse, not one of you who cares enough to tell me that my son has taken the side of this, this\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. outlaw!\u201d", "9-10": "Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, spoke up: \u201cI saw the son of Jesse meet with Ahimelech son of Ahitub, in Nob.

None more honorable either. Do you think that was the first time I prayed with him for God's guidance? Hardly! But don't accuse me of any wrongdoing, me or my family. I have no idea what you're trying to get at with this 'outlaw' talk.\u201d", "16": "The king said, \u201cDeath, Ahimelech!

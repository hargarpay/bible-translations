The men of Jabesh petitioned Nahash: \u201cMake a treaty with us and we'll serve you.\u201d", "2": "Nahash said, \u201cI'll make a treaty with you on one condition: that every right eye among you be gouged out! I'll humiliate every last man and woman in Israel before I'm done!\u201d", "3": "The town leaders of Jabesh said, \u201cGive us time to send messengers around Israel\u2014seven days should do it. If no one shows up to help us, we'll accept your terms.\u201d", "4-5": "The messengers came to Saul's place at Gibeah and told the people what was going on. As the people broke out in loud wails, Saul showed up. He was coming back from the field with his oxen. Saul asked, \u201cWhat happened? Why is everyone crying?\u201d And they repeated the message that had come from Jabesh.", "6-7": "The Spirit of God came on Saul when he heard the report and he flew into a rage. He grabbed the yoke of oxen and butchered them on the spot. He sent the messengers throughout Israel distributing the bloody pieces with this message: \u201cAnyone who refuses to join up with Saul and Samuel, let this be the fate of his oxen!\u201d", "7-8": "The terror of God seized the people, and they came out, one and all, not a laggard among them.

You can deal with us on your terms.\u201d Long before dawn the next day, Saul had strategically placed his army in three groups. At first light they broke into the enemy camp and slaughtered Ammonites until noon. Those who were left ran for their lives, scattering every which way.", "12": "The people came to Samuel then and said, \u201cWhere are those men who said, 'Saul is not fit to rule over us'?

Come, let's go to Gilgal and there reconsecrate the kingship.\u201d", "15": "They all trooped out to Gilgal. Before God, they crowned Saul king at Gilgal. And there they worshiped, sacrificing peace offerings. Saul and all Israel celebrated magnificently."}

{"1": "Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan who live on Mount Samaria. You women oppress the poor and abuse the needy. You say to your husbands, \u201cGet some wine! Let's drink!\u201d", "2": "Adonay Yahweh has taken an oath on his holiness: Surely, the time is going to come when you will be taken away on hooks, and the rest of you on fishhooks.", "3": "Each of you will leave the city through breaks in the wall, one woman ahead of another. You will be thrown into a garbage dump. Yahweh declares this.", "4": "Go to Bethel and sin. Go to Gilgal and sin even more. Bring your sacrifices every morning. Bring a tenth of your income every three days.", "5": "Burn bread as a thank offering. Brag and boast about your freewill offerings. This is what you people of Israel love to do. Adonay Yahweh declares this.", "6": "I left you with nothing to eat in any of your cities. I left you with no food in your entire land. And you still didn't return to me, declares Yahweh.", "7": "I stopped the rain from falling three months before the harvest. I sent rain on one city and not on another. One field had rain. Another field had none and dried up.", "8": "So people from two or three cities staggered as they walked to another city in order to get a drink of water. But they couldn't get enough. And you still didn't return to me, declares Yahweh.", "9": "I struck your crops with blight and mildew. Locusts repeatedly devoured your gardens, vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees. And you still didn't return to me, declares Yahweh.", "10": "I sent plagues on you as I did to Egypt. With swords I killed your best young men along with your captured horses. I made the stench from your camps fill your noses. And you still didn't return to me, declares Yahweh.", "11": "I destroyed some of you as Elohim destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning log snatched from a fire. And you still didn't return to me, declares Yahweh.", "12": "This is what I will do to you, Israel. Prepare to meet your Elohim. This is what I will do to you, Israel!", "13": "Elohim forms the mountains and creates the wind. He reveals his thoughts to humans. He makes dawn and dusk appear. He walks on the high places of the earth. His name is Yahweh Elohe Tsebaoth."}

Obey his directions, laws, commands, rules, and written instructions as they are recorded in Moses' Teachings. Then you'll succeed in everything you do wherever you may go. ", "4": "You'll succeed because Yahweh will keep the promise he made to me: 'If your descendants are faithful to me with all their hearts and lives, you will never fail to have an heir on the throne of Israel.'", "5": "\u201cYou know what Joab (Zeruiah's son) did to me and to the two commanders of Israel's army\u2014Abner, son of Ner, and Amasa, son of Jether. Joab killed them. When there was peace, he shed blood as if it were wartime. With their blood he stained the belt around his waist and the shoes on his feet. ", "6": "Use your wisdom. Don't let that gray-haired, old man go to his grave peacefully.", "7": "\u201cBe kind to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead. Let them eat at your table. They helped me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom.", "8": "\u201cShimei, son of Gera from Bahurim in Benjamin, is still with you. He cursed me repeatedly when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came to meet me at the Jordan River, I took an oath by Yahweh and said, 'As long as I'm king, I won't have you killed.' ", "9": "Now, don't let him go unpunished. You are wise and know what to do to him: Put that gray-haired, old man into his grave by slaughtering him.\u201d", "10": "David lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. ", "11": "He ruled as king of Israel for 40 years. He ruled for 7 years in Hebron and for 33 years in Jerusalem.", "12": "Solomon sat on his father David's throne, and his power was firmly established.", "13": "Then Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. \u201cIs this a friendly visit?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered.

All Israel expected me to be their king. But the kingship has been turned over to my brother because Yahweh gave it to him. ", "16": "Now I want to ask you for one thing. Don't refuse me.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.", "17": "He said, \u201cPlease ask King Solomon to give me Abishag from Shunem as my wife. He will not refuse you.\u201d", "18": "\u201cVery well,\u201d Bathsheba answered. \u201cI will talk to the king for you.\u201d", "19": "Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him on Adonijah's behalf. The king got up to meet her and bowed down in front of her. Then he sat on his throne. He had a throne brought for his mother, and she sat at his right side.", "20": "\u201cI'm asking you for one little thing,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't refuse me.\u201d \u201cAsk, Mother,\u201d the king told her. \u201cI won't refuse you.\u201d", "21": "She replied, \u201cLet Abishag from Shunem be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.\u201d", "22": "King Solomon then said, \u201cWhy do you ask that Abishag from Shunem be given to Adonijah? That would be the same as giving him the kingship. After all, he is my older brother. The priest Abiathar and Joab (Zeruiah's son) are supporting him.\u201d", "23": "King Solomon took an oath by Yahweh and said, \u201cMay Elohim strike me dead if Adonijah doesn't pay with his life for this request!

So I solemnly swear, as Yahweh who has established me lives, that Adonijah will be put to death today.\u201d ", "25": "King Solomon gave this task to Benaiah, son of Jehoiada. Benaiah attacked and killed Adonijah.", "26": "The king told the priest Abiathar, \u201cGo to your land in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I won't kill you at this time because you carried the ark of Adonay Yahweh ahead of my father David and because you shared all my father's sufferings.\u201d ", "27": "So Solomon removed Abiathar as Yahweh's priest and fulfilled Yahweh's word spoken at Shiloh about Eli's family.", "28": "The news reached Joab.

Kill him, and bury him. You can remove the innocent blood\u2014the blood which Joab shed\u2014from me and my father's family. ", "32": "Yahweh will repay him for the slaughter he caused. Joab killed two honorable men who were better than he was. He used his sword to kill Abner (who was the son of Ner and the commander of Israel's army) and Amasa (who was the son of Jether and the commander of Judah's army). Joab did this without my father's knowledge. ", "33": "The responsibility for their blood will fall on Joab and his descendants forever. But may David, his descendants, family, and throne always receive peace from Yahweh.\u201d", "34": "Then Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, went and attacked Joab, killed him, and buried him at his home in the desert.

King Solomon also replaced Abiathar with the priest Zadok.", "36": "The king summoned Shimei and said to him, \u201cBuild a house for yourself in Jerusalem, and stay there.

You will be responsible for your own death.\u201d", "38": "\u201cVery well,\u201d Shimei answered. \u201cI'll do just what Your Majesty said.\u201d So Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.

Shimei was told that his slaves were in Gath, ", "40": "so he saddled his donkey and went to Achish in Gath to search for his slaves. Shimei went to Gath and got his slaves.", "41": "After Solomon heard that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and back, ", "42": "he summoned Shimei. Solomon asked him, \u201cDidn't I make you take an oath by Yahweh? Didn't I warn you that if you left the city to go anywhere, you could be certain that you would die? Didn't you say to me, 'Very well. I'll do just what you said'? ", "43": "Why didn't you keep your oath to Yahweh and obey the command I gave you?

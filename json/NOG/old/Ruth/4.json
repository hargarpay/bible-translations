{"1": "Boaz went to the city gate and sat there. Just then, the relative about whom he had spoken was passing by. Boaz said, \u201cPlease come over here and sit, my friend.\u201d So the man came over and sat down.", "2": "Then Boaz chose ten men who were leaders of that city and said, \u201cSit here.\u201d So they also sat down.", "3": "Boaz said to the man, \u201cNaomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech. ", "4": "So I said that I would inform you. Buy it in the presence of these men sitting here and in the presence of the leaders of our people. If you wish to buy back the property, you can buy back the property. But if you do not wish to buy back the property, tell me. Then I will know that I am next in line because there is no other relative except me.\u201d The man said, \u201cI'll buy back the property.\u201d", "5": "Boaz continued, \u201cWhen you buy the field from Naomi, you will also assume responsibility for the Moabite Ruth, the dead man's widow. This keeps the inheritance in the dead man's name.\u201d", "6": "The man replied, \u201cIn that case I cannot assume responsibility for her. If I did, I would ruin my inheritance. Take all my rights to buy back the property for yourself, because I cannot assume that responsibility.\u201d", "7": "(This is the way it used to be in Israel concerning buying back property and exchanging goods: In order to make every matter legal, a man would take off his sandal and give it to the other man. This was the way a contract was publicly approved in Israel.) ", "8": "So when the man said to Boaz, \u201cBuy it for yourself,\u201d he took off his sandal.", "9": "Then Boaz said to the leaders and to all the people, \u201cToday you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. ", "10": "In addition, I have bought as my wife the Moabite Ruth, Mahlon's widow, to keep the inheritance in the dead man's name. In this way the dead man's name will not be cut off from his relatives or from the public records. Today you are witnesses.\u201d", "11": "All the people who were at the gate, including the leaders, said, \u201cWe are witnesses. May Yahweh make this wife, who is coming into your home, like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built our family of Israel. So show your strength of character in Ephrathah and make a name for yourself in Bethlehem. ", "12": "Also, from the descendant whom Yahweh will give you from this young woman, may your family become like the family of Perez, the son whom Tamar gave birth to for Judah.\u201d", "13": "Then Boaz took Ruth home, and she became his wife. He slept with her, and Yahweh gave her the ability to become pregnant. So she gave birth to a son.", "14": "The women said to Naomi, \u201cPraise Yahweh, who has remembered today to give you someone who will take care of you. The child's name will be famous in Israel. ", "15": "He will bring you a new life and support you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law who loves you is better to you than seven sons, because she has given birth.\u201d", "16": "Naomi took the child, held him on her lap, and became his guardian.", "17": "The women in the neighborhood said, \u201cNaomi has a son.\u201d So they gave him the name Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.", "18": "This is the account of Perez and his family. Perez was the father of Hezron.", "19": "Hezron was the father of Ram. Ram was the father of Amminadab.", "20": "Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.", "21": "Salmon was the father of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed.", "22": "Obed was the father of Jesse. Jesse was the father of David."}

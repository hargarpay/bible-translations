Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's Egyptian officials and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.", "2": "Yahweh was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. He worked in the house of his Egyptian master. ", "3": "Joseph's master saw that Yahweh was with him and that Yahweh made everything he did successful. ", "4": "Potiphar liked Joseph so much that he made him his trusted servant. He put him in charge of his household and everything he owned. ", "5": "From that time on Yahweh blessed the Egyptian's household because of Joseph. Therefore, Yahweh's blessing was on everything Potiphar owned in his house and in his fields. ", "6": "So he left all that he owned in Joseph's care. He wasn't concerned about anything except the food he ate. Joseph was well-built and handsome. ", "7": "After a while his master's wife began to desire Joseph, so she said, \u201cCome to bed with me.\u201d", "8": "But Joseph refused and said to her, \u201cMy master doesn't concern himself with anything in the house. He trusts me with everything he owns. ", "9": "No one in this house is greater than I. He's kept nothing back from me except you, because you're his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against Elohim?\u201d ", "10": "Although she kept asking Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or be with her.", "11": "One day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants were there.

Yahweh reached out to him with his unchanging love and gave him protection. Yahweh also put Joseph on good terms with the warden.

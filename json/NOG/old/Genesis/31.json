", "5": "He said to them, \u201cI have seen that your father isn't as friendly to me as he was before, but the Elohim of my father has been with me. ", "6": "You know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father. ", "7": "Your father has cheated me. He has changed my wages ten times. But Elohim hasn't let him harm me. ", "8": "Whenever he said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' all the flocks gave birth to speckled young. And whenever he said, 'The striped ones will be your wages,' all the flocks gave birth to striped young. ", "9": "So Elohim has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me.", "10": "\u201cDuring the mating season I had a dream: I looked up and saw that the male goats which were mating were striped, speckled, or spotted. ", "11": "In the dream the Messenger of Elohim called to me, 'Jacob!' And I answered, 'Yes, here I am.' ", "12": "He said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, or spotted, because I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you.

Now leave this land, and go back to the land of your relatives.'\u201d", "14": "Rachel and Leah answered him, \u201cIs there anything left in our father's household for us to inherit? ", "15": "Doesn't he think of us as foreigners? Not only did he sell us, but he has used up the money that was paid for us. ", "16": "Certainly, all the wealth that Elohim took away from our father belongs to us and our children. Now do whatever Elohim has told you.\u201d", "17": "Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels. ", "18": "He drove all his livestock ahead of him and took all the possessions that he had accumulated. He took his own livestock that he had accumulated in Paddan Aram and went back to his father Isaac in Canaan.", "19": "When Laban went to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's idols. ", "20": "Jacob also tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving. ", "21": "So he left in a hurry with all that belonged to him. He crossed the Euphrates River and went toward the mountains of Gilead.", "22": "Two days later Laban was told that Jacob had left in a hurry. ", "23": "He and his relatives pursued Jacob for seven days.

So Laban and his relatives put up their tents in the mountains of Gilead. ", "26": "Then Laban asked Jacob, \u201cWhat have you done by tricking me? You've carried off my daughters like prisoners of war. ", "27": "Why did you leave secretly and trick me? You didn't even tell me you were leaving. I would have sent you on your way rejoicing, with songs accompanied by tambourines and lyres. ", "28": "You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters. You've done a foolish thing. ", "29": "I have the power to harm you. Last night the Elohim of your father said to me, 'Be careful not to say anything at all to Jacob.' ", "30": "Now you have left for your father's home because you were so homesick. But why did you steal my gods?\u201d", "31": "Jacob answered Laban, \u201cI left because I was afraid. I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. ", "32": "If you find your gods, the one who has them will not be allowed to live. In the presence of our relatives, search as much as you want through what I have, and take what is yours.\u201d (Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen the gods.)", "33": "So Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two slaves. But he found nothing. He came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's tent. ", "34": "Rachel had taken the idols and had put them in her camel's saddle-bag and was sitting on them. Laban rummaged through the whole tent but found nothing.", "35": "Rachel said to her father, \u201cDon't be angry, Father, but I can't get up to greet you; I'm having my period.\u201d So even though Laban had made a thorough search, he didn't find the idols.", "36": "Then Jacob became angry and confronted Laban. \u201cWhat is my crime?\u201d Jacob demanded of Laban. \u201cWhat is my offense that you have come chasing after me?

", "39": "I never brought you any of the flock that was killed by wild animals. I paid for the loss myself. That's what you demanded of me when any of the flock was stolen during the day or at night. ", "40": "The scorching heat during the day and the cold at night wore me down, and I lost a lot of sleep. ", "41": "I've been with your household 20 years now. I worked for you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. ", "42": "If the Elohim of my father, the Elohim of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac,[b] had not been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed by now. Elohim has seen my misery and hard work, and last night he made it right.\u201d", "43": "Then Laban answered Jacob, \u201cThese are my daughters, my grandchildren, and my flocks. Everything you see is mine! Yet, what can I do today for my daughters or for their children? ", "44": "Now, let's make an agreement and let it stand as a witness between you and me.\u201d", "45": "Jacob took a stone and set it up as a marker. ", "46": "Then Jacob said to his relatives, \u201cGather some stones.\u201d They took stones, put them into a pile, and ate there by the pile of stones.

", "52": "This pile of stones and this marker stand as witnesses that I will not go past the pile of stones to harm you, and that you will not go past the pile of stones or marker to harm me. ", "53": "May the Elohim of Abraham and Nahor\u2014the Elohim of their father\u2014judge between us.\u201d So Jacob swore this oath by the Fear of his father Isaac ", "54": "and offered a sacrifice on the mountain. He invited his relatives to eat the meal with him. They ate with him and spent the night on the mountain.[d]", "55": "Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and went back home."}

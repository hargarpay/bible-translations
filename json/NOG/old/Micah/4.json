{"1": "In the last days the mountain of Yahweh's house will be established as the highest of the mountains and raised above the hills. People will stream to it.", "2": "Then many nations will come and say, \u201cLet's go to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the Elohim of Jacob. He will teach us his ways so that we may live by them.\u201d The teachings will go out from Zion. The word of Yahweh will go out from Jerusalem.", "3": "Then he will judge disputes between many people and settle arguments between many nations far and wide. They will hammer their swords into plowblades and their spears into pruning shears. Nations will never fight against each other, and they will never train for war again.", "4": "They will sit under their grapevines and their fig trees, and no one will make them afraid. Yahweh Tsebaoth has spoken.", "5": "All the nations live by the names of their gods, but we will live by the name of Yahweh our Elohim forever.", "6": "\u201cWhen that day comes,\u201d declares Yahweh, \u201cI will gather those who are lame. I will bring together those who are scattered and those whom I have injured.", "7": "I will change those who are lame into a faithful people. I will change those who are forced away into a strong nation.\u201d Yahweh will rule them on Mount Zion now and forever.", "8": "You, Jerusalem, watchtower of the flock, stronghold of the people of Zion, your former government will come back to you. The kingdom will return to the people of Jerusalem.", "9": "Now why are you crying so loudly? Don't you have a king? Has your counselor died? Pain grips you like a woman in labor.", "10": "Daughter of Zion, writhe in pain and groan like a woman in labor. Now you will leave the city, live in the open fields, and go to Babylon. There you will be rescued. There Yahweh will reclaim you from your enemies.", "11": "But now many nations gather against you. They say, \u201cLet's dishonor Zion and gloat over it.\u201d", "12": "They don't know the thoughts of Yahweh or understand his plan. He will bring them together like cut grain on the threshing floor.[a]", "13": "Get up and thresh,[b] people of Zion. I will make your horns as hard as iron and your hoofs as hard as bronze. You will smash many nations into small pieces. You will claim their loot for Yahweh, their wealth for the Adonay of the whole earth."}

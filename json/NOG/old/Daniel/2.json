", "2": "The king sent for the magicians, psychics, sorcerers, and astrologers so that they could tell him what he had dreamed. So they came to the king.", "3": "The king said to them, \u201cI had a dream, and I'm troubled by it. I want to know what the dream was.\u201d", "4": "The astrologers spoke to the king in Aramaic, \u201cYour Majesty, may you live forever! Tell us the dream, and we'll interpret it for you.\u201d", "5": "The king answered the astrologers, \u201cI meant what I said! If you don't tell me the dream and its meaning, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be turned into piles of rubble.

So tell me the dream. Then I'll know that you can explain its meaning to me.\u201d", "10": "The astrologers answered the king, \u201cNo one on earth can tell the king what he asks. No other king, no matter how great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, psychic, or astrologer. ", "11": "What you ask is difficult, Your Majesty. No one can tell what you dreamed except the gods, and they don't live with humans.\u201d", "12": "This made the king so angry and furious that he gave an order to destroy all the wise advisers in Babylon. ", "13": "So a decree was issued that the wise advisers were to be killed, and some men were sent to find Daniel and his friends and kill them.", "14": "While Arioch, the captain of the royal guard, was leaving to kill the wise advisers in Babylon, Daniel spoke to him using shrewd judgment.

So Daniel praised the Elah of heaven. ", "20": "He said, \u201cPraise Eloah's name from everlasting to everlasting because he is wise and powerful.", "21": "He changes times and periods of history. He removes kings and establishes them. He gives wisdom to those who are wise and knowledge to those who have insight.", "22": "He reveals deeply hidden things. He knows what is in the dark, and light lives with him.", "23": "Elah of my ancestors, I thank and praise you. You gave me wisdom and power. You told me the answer to our question.

This is your dream, the vision you had while you were asleep: ", "29": "Your Majesty, while you were lying in bed, thoughts about what would happen in the future came to you. The one who reveals secrets told you what is going to happen. ", "30": "This secret wasn't revealed to me because I'm wiser than anyone else. It was revealed so that you could be told the meaning and so that you would know your innermost thoughts.", "31": "\u201cYour Majesty, you had a vision. You saw a large statue. This statue was very bright. It stood in front of you, and it looked terrifying. ", "32": "The head of this statue was made of fine gold. Its chest and arms were made of silver. Its stomach and hips were made of bronze. ", "33": "Its legs were made of iron. Its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay.

", "39": "Another kingdom, inferior to yours, will rise to power after you. Then there will be a third kingdom, a kingdom of bronze, that will rule the whole world. ", "40": "There will also be a fourth kingdom. It will be as strong as iron. (Iron smashes and shatters everything.) As iron crushes things, this fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms. ", "41": "You also saw the feet and toes. They were partly potters' clay and partly iron. This means that there will be a divided kingdom which has some of the firmness of iron. As you saw, iron was mixed with clay. ", "42": "The toes were partly iron and partly clay. Part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle. ", "43": "As you saw, iron was mixed with clay. So the two parts of the kingdom will mix by intermarrying, but they will not hold together any more than iron can mix with clay.", "44": "\u201cAt the time of those kings, the Elah of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed. No other people will be permitted to rule it. It will smash all the other kingdoms and put an end to them. But it will be established forever.

The great Elah has told you what will happen in the future, Your Majesty. The dream is true, and you can trust that this is its meaning.\u201d", "46": "King Nebuchadnezzar immediately bowed down on the ground in front of Daniel. He ordered that gifts and offerings be given to Daniel. ", "47": "The king said to Daniel, \u201cYour Elah is truly the greatest of gods, the Lord over kings. He can reveal secrets because you were able to reveal this secret.\u201d", "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many wonderful gifts. Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel governor of the whole province of Babylon and head of all Babylon's wise advisers. ", "49": "With the king's permission, Daniel appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to govern the province of Babylon. But Daniel stayed at the king's court."}

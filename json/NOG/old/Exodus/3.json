As he led the sheep to the far side of the desert, he came to Horeb, the mountain of Elohim.", "2": "The Messenger of Yahweh appeared to him there as flames of fire coming out of a bush. Moses looked, and although the bush was on fire, it was not burning up. ", "3": "So he thought, \u201cWhy isn't this bush burning up? I must go over there and see this strange sight.\u201d", "4": "When Yahweh saw that Moses had come over to see it, Elohim called to him from the bush, \u201cMoses, Moses!\u201d Moses answered, \u201cHere I am!\u201d", "5": "Elohim said, \u201cDon't come any closer! Take off your sandals because this place where you are standing is holy ground.

I know how much they're suffering. ", "8": "I have come to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good land with plenty of room for everyone. It is a land flowing with milk and honey where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites live. ", "9": "I have heard the cry of the people of Israel. I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them. ", "10": "Now, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you can bring my people Israel out of Egypt.\u201d", "11": "But Moses said to Elohim, \u201cWho am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the people of Israel out of Egypt?\u201d", "12": "Elohim answered, \u201cI will be with you. And this will be the proof that I sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship Elohim on this mountain.\u201d", "13": "Then Moses replied to Elohim, \u201cSuppose I go to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The Elohim of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?\u201d", "14": "Elohim answered Moses, \u201cEhyeh Who Ehyeh. This is what you must say to the people of Israel: 'Ehyeh has sent me to you.'\u201d", "15": "Again Elohim said to Moses, \u201cThis is what you must say to the people of Israel: Yahweh Elohim of your ancestors, the Elohim of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has sent me to you.

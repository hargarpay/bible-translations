Let my people go to worship me. ", "4": "If you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country. ", "5": "They will cover the land so that the ground can't be seen. They will eat everything left by the hail, including every tree still standing in the fields. ", "6": "They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and those of all the Egyptians.

Never before had there been so many locusts like this, nor would there ever be that many again. ", "15": "They covered all the ground until it was black with them.

", "5": "David and the entire nation of Israel were celebrating in Yahweh's presence with all kinds of instruments made from cypress wood[c] and with lyres, harps, tambourines, sistrums,[d] and cymbals.", "6": "But when they came to Nacon's threshing floor,[e] the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah reached out for the ark of Elohim and grabbed it. ", "7": "Yahweh became angry with Uzzah, so God killed him there for his lack of respect. He died beside the ark of Elohim.", "8": "David was angry because Yahweh had struck Uzzah so violently. (That place is still called Perez Uzzah [The Striking of Uzzah] today.) ", "9": "David was afraid of Yahweh that day. \u201cHow can the ark of Yahweh come to my city?\u201d he asked. ", "10": "So David wouldn't bring the ark of Yahweh with him to the City of David. Instead, he rerouted it to the home of Obed Edom, who was from Gath. ", "11": "The ark of Yahweh stayed at the home of Obed Edom from Gath for three months, and Yahweh blessed Obed Edom and his whole family.", "12": "King David was told, \u201cYahweh has blessed Obed Edom's home and everything he owns because of the ark of Elohim.\u201d Then David joyfully went to get the ark of Elohim from Obed Edom's house and bring it to the City of David.

Then all the people went home.", "20": "When David returned to bless his family, Saul's daughter Michal came out to meet him. \u201cHow dignified Israel's king was today! He was exposing himself before the eyes of the slave girls of his palace staff\u2014like a mindless fool might expose himself!\u201d", "21": "David answered Michal, \u201cI didn't dance in front of the slave girls but in front of Yahweh. He chose me rather than your father or anyone in your father's house, and he appointed me leader of Israel, Yahweh's people. I will celebrate in Yahweh's presence, ", "22": "and I will degrade myself even more than this. Even if I am humiliated in your eyes, I will be honored by these slave girls you speak about.\u201d", "23": "So Saul's daughter Michal was childless her entire life."}

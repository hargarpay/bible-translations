", "2": "In front of his allies and the army from Samaria, he said, \u201cWhat do these miserable Jews think they're doing? Can they rebuild it by themselves? Are they going to offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Will they get the stones out of the rubbish heaps, burned as these stones are, and give them new strength?\u201d", "3": "Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside Sanballat, said, \u201cEven a fox would make their stone wall collapse if it walked on top of what they're building!\u201d", "4": "Nehemiah prayed, \u201cOur Elohim, hear us. We are despised. Turn their insults back on them, and let them be robbed in the land where they are prisoners. ", "5": "Don't ignore their guilt, and don't let their sins disappear from your records. They have insulted you in front of these builders.\u201d", "6": "So we rebuilt the wall, which was rebuilt to about half its original height. The people worked with determination.", "7": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from Ashdod heard that the repair work on the walls of Jerusalem was making progress and that the gaps were being filled in, they became furious. ", "8": "All of them plotted to attack Jerusalem to create confusion. ", "9": "But we prayed to our Elohim and set guards to protect us day and night.", "10": "Then the people of Judah said, \u201cThe work crews are worn out, and there is too much rubble. We can't continue to rebuild the wall.\u201d", "11": "Our enemies said, \u201cBefore they know what is happening or see a thing, we will be right in the middle of them. We'll kill them and bring the work to an end.\u201d", "12": "Jews who were living near our enemies warned us ten times that our enemies would attack us from every direction.[b]", "13": "That is why I positioned people by their families behind the wall where it was lowest and most exposed. The people were armed with swords, spears, and bows. ", "14": "I looked them over and proceeded to tell the nobles, the leaders, and the rest of the people, \u201cDon't be afraid of our enemies. Remember how great and awe-inspiring Adonay is. Fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.\u201d", "15": "When our enemies heard that we knew about their plots and that Elohim had prevented their plans from being successful, we all went back to the work on the wall.

The workers who were carrying loads did the work with one hand and held their weapons with the other, ", "18": "and each builder had his sword fastened to his side.

Neither did I. We each kept our weapons at hand."}

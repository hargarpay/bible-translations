{"1": "O Yahweh, you are my Elohim. I will highly honor you; I will praise your name. You have done miraculous things. You have been completely reliable in carrying out your plans from long ago.", "2": "You have turned cities into ruins, fortified cities into piles of rubble, and foreigners' palaces into cities that will never be rebuilt.", "3": "That is why strong people will honor you, and cities ruled by the world's tyrants will fear you.", "4": "You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in their distress, a shelter from the rain, and shade from the heat. (A tyrant's breath is like a rainstorm against a wall,", "5": "like heat in a dry land.) You calm the uproar of foreigners. The song of tyrants is silenced like heat that is reduced by the shadow of a cloud.", "6": "On this mountain Yahweh Tsebaoth will prepare for all people a feast with the best foods, a banquet with aged wines, with the best foods and the finest wines.", "7": "On this mountain he will remove the veil of grief covering all people and the mask covering all nations.", "8": "He will swallow up death forever.

Let us rejoice and be glad because he will save us.\u201d", "10": "Yahweh's power will be on this mountain.

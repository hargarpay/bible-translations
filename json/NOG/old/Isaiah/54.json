{"1": "Sing with joy, you childless women who never gave birth to children. Break into shouts of joy, you women who never had birth pains. \u201cThere will be more children of women who have been deserted than there are children of married women,\u201d says Yahweh.", "2": "Expand the space of your tent. Stretch out the curtains of your tent, and don't hold back. Lengthen your tent ropes, and drive in the tent pegs.", "3": "You will spread out to the right and left. Your descendants will take over other nations, and they will resettle deserted cities.", "4": "Don't be afraid, because you won't be put to shame. Don't be discouraged, because you won't be disgraced. You'll forget the shame you've had since you were young. You won't remember the disgrace of your husband's death anymore.", "5": "Your husband is your maker. His name is Yahweh Tsebaoth. Your Go'el is Qedosh Yisrael. He is called the Elohim of the whole earth.", "6": "\u201cYahweh has called you as if you were a wife who was abandoned and in grief, a wife who married young and was rejected,\u201d says your Elohim.", "7": "\u201cI abandoned you for one brief moment, but I will bring you back with unlimited compassion.", "8": "I hid my face from you for a moment in a burst of anger, but I will have compassion on you with everlasting kindness,\u201d says Yahweh your Go'el.", "9": "\u201cTo me this is like Noah's floodwaters, when I swore an oath that Noah's floodwaters would never cover the earth again. So now I swear an oath not to be angry with you or punish you.", "10": "The mountains may move, and the hills may shake, but my kindness will never depart from you. My promise[a] of peace will never change,\u201d says Yahweh, who has compassion on you.", "11": "\u201cYou suffering, comfortless, storm-ravaged city! I will rebuild your city with precious stones. I will reset your foundations with sapphires.", "12": "I will rebuild your towers with rubies, your gates with sparkling stones, and all your walls with precious stones.\u201d", "13": "All your children will be taught by Yahweh, and your children will have unlimited peace.", "14": "You will be established in righteousness. You will be far from oppression, so you will not be afraid. You will be far from destruction, so it won't come near you.", "15": "\u201cIf anyone attacks you, it will not be my doing. Whoever attacks you will be defeated by you.", "16": "I've created blacksmiths to fan the coals into flames and to produce useful weapons. I've also created destroyers to bring destruction.", "17": "No weapon that has been made to be used against you will succeed. You will have an answer for anyone who accuses you. This is the inheritance of Yahweh's servants. Their victory comes from me,\u201d declares Yahweh."}

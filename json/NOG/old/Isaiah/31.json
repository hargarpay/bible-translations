{"1": "How horrible it will be for those who go to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who depend on many chariots, who depend on very strong war horses. They don't look to Qedosh Yisrael. They don't seek Yahweh.", "2": "He is wise and can bring about disaster. He doesn't take back his words. He rises against wicked people and against those who help troublemakers.", "3": "The Egyptians are humans, not gods. Their horses are flesh and blood, not spirit. When Yahweh uses his powerful hand, the one who gives help will stumble, and the one who receives help will fall. Both will die together.", "4": "This is what Yahweh said to me: A lion, even a young lion, growls over its prey when a crowd of shepherds is called to fight it. It isn't frightened by their voices or disturbed by the noise they make. So Yahweh Tsebaoth will come to fight for Mount Zion and its hill.", "5": "Yahweh Tsebaoth will defend Jerusalem like a hovering bird. He will defend it and rescue it. He will pass over it and protect it.", "6": "You people of Israel, return to the one whom you have so violently rebelled against.", "7": "When that day comes, all of you will reject the silver and gold idols that your sinful hands have made.", "8": "Then Assyrians will be killed with swords not made by human hands. Swords not made by human hands will destroy them. They will flee from battle, and their young men will be made to do forced labor.", "9": "In terror they will run to their stronghold,[a] and their officers will be frightened at the sight of the battle flag. Yahweh declares this. His fire is in Zion and his furnace is in Jerusalem."}

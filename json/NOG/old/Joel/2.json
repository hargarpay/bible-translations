{"1": "Blow the ram's horn in Zion. Sound the alarm on my holy mountain. Everyone who lives in the land should tremble, because the day of Yahweh is coming. Certainly, it is near.", "2": "It is a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and overcast skies. A large and mighty army will spread over the mountains like the dawn.[a] Nothing like this has ever happened. Nothing like this will ever happen again.", "3": "In front of this army a fire burns. Behind it flames are blazing. In front of it the land is like the garden of Eden. Behind it the land is like a barren desert. Nothing escapes it!", "4": "The soldiers look like horses. They run like war horses.", "5": "As they leap on mountaintops, they sound like rattling chariots, like crackling fire burning up straw, and like a mighty army prepared for battle.", "6": "People are terrified in their presence. Every face turns pale.", "7": "They run like warriors. They climb walls like soldiers. They march straight ahead. They do not leave their places.", "8": "They do not crowd one another. They keep in their own lines. Even when they break through the defenses, they do not break their ranks.", "9": "They rush into the city. They run along the wall. They climb into houses. They enter through windows like thieves.", "10": "The earth quakes in their presence, and the sky shakes. The sun and the moon turn dark, and the stars no longer shine.", "11": "Yahweh shouts out orders to his army. His forces are very large. The troops that carry out his commands are mighty. The day of Yahweh is extremely terrifying. Who can endure it?", "12": "\u201cBut even now,\u201d declares Yahweh, \u201creturn to me with all your heart\u2014 with fasting, crying, and mourning.\u201d", "13": "Tear your hearts, not your clothes. Return to Yahweh your Elohim. He is merciful and compassionate, patient, and always ready to forgive and to change his plans about disaster.", "14": "Who knows? He may reconsider and change his plan and leave a blessing for you. Then you could give grain offerings and wine offerings to Yahweh your Elohim.", "15": "Blow the ram's horn in Zion. Schedule a time to fast. Call for an assembly.", "16": "Gather the people. Prepare them for a holy meeting. Assemble the leaders. Gather the children, even the nursing infants. Grooms leave their rooms. Brides leave their chambers.", "17": "The priests who serve Yahweh cry between the altar and the entrance to the temple. They say, \u201cSpare your people, O Yahweh. Don't let the people who belong to you become a disgrace. Don't let the nations ridicule them. Why should people ask, 'Where is their Elohim?'\u201d", "18": "Then Yahweh became concerned about his land, and he had pity on his people.", "19": "Yahweh said to his people, \u201cI am going to send grain, new wine, and olive oil to you. You will be satisfied with them. I will no longer make you a disgrace among the nations.", "20": "\u201cI will keep the northern army far from you, and I will force it into a dry and barren land. The soldiers in front will be forced into the eastern sea. The soldiers in back will be forced into the western sea. A foul odor will rise from the dead bodies. They will stink.\u201d He has done great things!", "21": "Land, do not be afraid. Be glad and rejoice. Yahweh has done great things!", "22": "Wild animals, do not be afraid. The pastures in the wilderness have turned green. The trees have produced their fruit. There are plenty of figs and grapes.", "23": "People of Zion, be glad and find joy in Yahweh your Elohim. Yahweh has given you the Teacher of Righteousness.[b] He has sent the autumn rain and the spring rain as before.", "24": "The threshing floors[c] will be filled with grain. The vats will overflow with new wine and olive oil.", "25": "\u201cThen I will repay you for the years that the mature locusts, the adult locusts, the grasshoppers, and the young locusts ate your crops. (They are the large army that I sent against you.)", "26": "You will have plenty to eat, and you will be full. You will praise the name of Yahweh your Elohim, who has performed miracles for you. My people will never be ashamed again.", "27": "You will know that I am in Israel. I am Yahweh your Elohim, and there is no other. My people will never be ashamed again.[d]", "28": "\u201cAfter this, I will pour my Ruach on everyone. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions.", "29": "In those days I will pour my Ruach on servants, on both men and women.", "30": "I will work miracles in the sky and on the earth: blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.", "31": "The sun will become dark, and the moon will become as red as blood before the terrifying day of Yahweh comes.\u201d", "32": "Then whoever calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved. Those who escape will be on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem. Among the survivors will be those whom Yahweh calls, as Yahweh has promised."}

I will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat.[b] I will judge them there. They scattered the Israelites, the people who belong to me, among the nations. They divided my land.", "3": "They threw dice for my people. They traded boys for prostitutes. They sold girls so that they could buy wine to drink.", "4": "\u201cNow what do you have against me, Tyre and Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will quickly pay you back for what you have done.", "5": "You took my silver and my gold. You brought my finest treasures to your temples.", "6": "You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks.

I will pay you back for what you have done.", "8": "I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah. They will sell them to the people of Sheba, a nation that is far away.\u201d Yahweh has spoken.", "9": "Announce this among the nations: Prepare yourselves for war. Wake up the warriors.

A spring will flow from Yahweh's temple. It will water the valley of Shittim.", "19": "Egypt will become a wasteland. Edom will become a barren desert.

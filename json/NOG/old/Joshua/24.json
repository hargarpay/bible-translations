{"1": "Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem. He called together Israel's leaders, chiefs, judges, and officers, and they presented themselves to Elohim.", "2": "Joshua said to all the people, \u201cThis is what Yahweh Elohim of Israel says: Long ago your ancestors, Terah and his sons Abraham and Nahor, lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and served other gods. ", "3": "But I took your ancestor Abraham from the other side of the Euphrates River. I led him through all of Canaan and gave him many descendants. I also gave him Isaac. ", "4": "To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the mountains in Seir as his own. However, Jacob and his sons went to Egypt.", "5": "\u201cThen I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with plagues. Later I led you out. ", "6": "When I led your ancestors out of Egypt, you came to the sea. The Egyptians with their chariots and horsemen chased your ancestors to the Red Sea. ", "7": "When your ancestors cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians. He made the sea flow back and cover them. You saw for yourselves what I did to Egypt. Then you lived in the desert for a long time.", "8": "\u201cAfter that I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived on the east side of the Jordan River. They fought you. However, I handed them over to you. So you took their land, and I destroyed them in front of you. ", "9": "Then Balak, son of King Zippor of Moab, fought Israel. He summoned Balaam, son of Beor, to curse you. ", "10": "But I refused to listen to Balaam. All he could do was bless you. So I saved you from his power.", "11": "\u201cThen you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites fought you. But I handed them over to you. ", "12": "I sent hornets ahead of you to force out the two kings of the Amorites ahead of you. These things didn't happen because of your battle skills or fighting ability. ", "13": "So I gave you a land that you hadn't farmed, cities to live in that you hadn't built, vineyards and olive groves that you hadn't planted. So you ate all you wanted!", "14": "\u201cFear Yahweh, and serve him with integrity and faithfulness. Get rid of the gods your ancestors served on the other side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve only Yahweh. ", "15": "But if you don't want to serve Yahweh, then choose today whom you will serve. Even if you choose the gods your ancestors served on the other side of the Euphrates or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live, my family and I will still serve Yahweh.\u201d", "16": "The people responded, \u201cIt would be unthinkable for us to abandon Yahweh to serve other gods. ", "17": "Yahweh our Elohim brought us and our ancestors out of slavery in Egypt. He did these spectacular signs right before our eyes. He guarded us wherever we went, especially as we passed through other nations. ", "18": "Yahweh forced out all the people ahead of us, including the Amorites who lived in this land. We, too, will serve Yahweh, because he is our Elohim.\u201d", "19": "But Joshua answered the people, \u201cSince Yahweh is a holy Elohim, you can't possibly serve him. He is El Kanna. He will not forgive your rebellious acts and sins. ", "20": "If you abandon Yahweh and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you. He will destroy you, although he has been so good to you.\u201d", "21": "The people answered Joshua, \u201cNo! We will only serve Yahweh!\u201d", "22": "Joshua said to the people, \u201cYou have testified that you have chosen to serve Yahweh.\u201d They answered, \u201cYes, we have!\u201d", "23": "\u201cGet rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Turn yourselves entirely over to Yahweh Elohim of Israel.\u201d", "24": "The people replied to Joshua, \u201cWe will serve Yahweh our Elohim and obey him.\u201d", "25": "That day Joshua made an agreement for the people and set up laws and rules for them at Shechem. ", "26": "Joshua wrote these things in the Book of Elohim's Teachings. Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree at Yahweh's holy place. ", "27": "Joshua told all the people, \u201cThis stone will stand as a witness for us. It has heard all the words which Yahweh spoke to us. It will stand as a witness for you. You cannot deceive your Elohim.\u201d ", "28": "Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own property.", "29": "After these events, Yahweh's servant Joshua, son of Nun, died. He was 110 years old. ", "30": "He was buried on his own land at Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.", "31": "Israel served Yahweh as long as Joshua and the older leaders, who outlived him and who knew everything Yahweh had done for Israel, were alive.", "32": "Joseph's bones, which the people of Israel had brought from Egypt, were buried at Shechem. They were placed in the plot of ground Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for 100 pieces of silver. The plot was inherited by Joseph's descendants.", "33": "Aaron's son Eleazar also died. He was buried on the hill that had been given to his son Phinehas in the mountains of Ephraim."}

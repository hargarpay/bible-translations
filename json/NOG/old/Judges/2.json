I said, 'I will never break my promise[a] to you. ", "2": "You must never make a treaty with the people who live in this land. You must tear down their altars.' But you didn't obey me. What do you think you're doing? ", "3": "So I have this to say, 'I will not force them out of your way. They will be like thorns in your sides, and their gods will become a trap for you.'\u201d", "4": "While the Messenger of Yahweh was saying this to all the people of Israel, they began to cry loudly.

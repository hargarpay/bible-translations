Go to the Euphrates River, and bury it there in a crack in the rocks.\u201d ", "5": "So I went and buried it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh had told me.", "6": "After many days Yahweh said to me, \u201cGo to the Euphrates, and get the belt from where I told you to bury it.\u201d ", "7": "So I went back to the Euphrates and dug it up. I got the belt from where I had buried it. Now the belt was ruined. It was good for nothing.", "8": "Then Yahweh spoke his word to me. He said, ", "9": "\u201cThis is what Yahweh says: This is how I will destroy Judah's arrogance and Jerusalem's extreme arrogance. ", "10": "These wicked people refuse to listen to me.

{"1": "One day Saul's son Jonathan said to his armorbearer, \u201cLet's go to the Philistine military post on the other side.\u201d But Jonathan didn't tell his father he was going.", "2": "Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree at Migron. He had with him about 600 men ", "3": "in addition to Ahijah, the son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub, who was the son of Phinehas and the grandson of Eli, Yahweh's priest at Shiloh. Ahijah was wearing the priestly ephod.[a] The troops didn't know Jonathan had left. ", "4": "There was a cliff on each side of the mountain pass where Jonathan searched for a way to cross over to attack the Philistine military post. The name of one cliff was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh. ", "5": "One cliff stood like a pillar on the north facing Michmash, the other stood south facing Geba.", "6": "Jonathan said to his armorbearer, \u201cLet's go to the military post of these uncircumcised people. Maybe Yahweh will act on our behalf. Yahweh can win a victory with a few men as well as with many.\u201d", "7": "His armorbearer answered him, \u201cDo whatever you have in mind. Go ahead! I agree with you.\u201d", "8": "Jonathan continued, \u201cListen, we'll cross over to the Philistines and show ourselves to them. ", "9": "If they say to us, 'Stay where you are until we come to you,' then we'll stay where we are and not go up to them. ", "10": "But if they say to us, 'Come up here,' then we'll go up, because that will be our sign that Yahweh has handed them over to us.\u201d", "11": "So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine troops. The Philistines said, \u201cLook, some Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in.\u201d", "12": "\u201cCome up here,\u201d the men of the military post said to Jonathan and his armorbearer. \u201cWe have something to show you.\u201d Jonathan told his armorbearer, \u201cFollow me up to the military post because Yahweh has handed the troops over to Israel.\u201d", "13": "Jonathan climbed up the cliff, and his armorbearer followed him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines. His armorbearer, who was behind him, finished killing them. ", "14": "In their first slaughter Jonathan and his armorbearer killed about twenty men within about a hundred yards. ", "15": "There was panic among the army in the field and all the troops in the military post. The raiding party also trembled in fear. The earth shook, and there was a panic sent from Elohim.", "16": "Saul's watchmen at Gibeah in Benjamin could see the crowd in the Philistine camp dispersing in all directions.", "17": "\u201cLook around,\u201d Saul told the troops who were with him, \u201cand see who has left our camp.\u201d They looked and found that Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.", "18": "Then Saul said to Ahijah, \u201cBring the priestly ephod,\u201d because Ahijah carried the ephod in front of Israel that day.[b] ", "19": "While Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp grew worse and worse. Then Saul said to the priest, \u201cRemove your hand from the ephod.\u201d[c] ", "20": "Saul and all the troops with him assembled and went into battle. They found Philistine soldiers killing their fellow soldiers in wild confusion. ", "21": "The Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before this and had been stationed in the camp now joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. ", "22": "When all the men of Israel who had been hiding in the mountains of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also pursued the Philistines in battle. ", "23": "So Yahweh saved Israel that day. Now, the battle moved beyond Beth Aven. ", "24": "Israel's soldiers were driven hard that day. Saul made the troops swear, \u201cCursed is anyone who eats food before the evening comes and before I've gotten revenge on my enemies.\u201d So none of his troops tasted any food. ", "25": "The entire land had honeycombs,[d] and there was honey on the ground. ", "26": "When the troops entered the woods, the honey was flowing. But no one put his hand to his mouth, because the troops were afraid of violating their oath.", "27": "Jonathan hadn't heard that his father forced the troops to take an oath. So he stretched out the tip of the staff he had in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he put it to his mouth, his eyes lit up. ", "28": "Then one of the soldiers told him, \u201cYour father forced the troops to take a solemn oath: 'Cursed is anyone who eats food today.'\u201d Now, the army was exhausted. ", "29": "Jonathan answered, \u201cMy father has brought trouble to the country. See how my eyes lit up when I tasted a little of this honey? ", "30": "If only the troops had eaten some of the enemies' food, which they found today. We would have killed more Philistines.\u201d", "31": "That day they struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, but the troops were thoroughly exhausted. ", "32": "So the troops seized the Philistines' belongings. They took sheep, cows, and calves, and butchered them on the ground. The troops ate the meat with blood still in it. ", "33": "Some soldiers told Saul, \u201cThe troops are sinning against Yahweh by eating meat with blood in it.\u201d Saul replied, \u201cYou have been unfaithful. Roll a large rock over to me now.\u201d ", "34": "Then Saul said, \u201cSpread out through the troops, and tell them, 'Each of you, bring me your ox or your sheep, and butcher it here, and eat. But don't sin against Yahweh by eating meat with blood in it.'\u201d So each of the soldiers brought his ox with him that night and butchered it there.", "35": "Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first time he had built an altar to Yahweh.", "36": "Saul said to his men, \u201cLet's attack the Philistines tonight and take their possessions until the light of dawn. And let's not leave any of them alive.\u201d \u201cDo whatever you think is best,\u201d they responded. But the priest said, \u201cLet's consult Elohim first.\u201d", "37": "Then Saul asked Elohim, \u201cShould I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to Israel?\u201d But he received no answer that day.", "38": "So Saul ordered all the leaders of the troops, \u201cCome here! Find out what sin was committed today. ", "39": "I solemnly swear, as Yahweh and Savior of Israel lives, even if it is my son Jonathan who did it, he must die.\u201d But not one of the soldiers replied.", "40": "Saul told all Israel, \u201cYou stand on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will stand on the other side.\u201d \u201cDo whatever you think is best,\u201d the troops responded to Saul.", "41": "Then Saul said to Yahweh, \u201cO Elohim of Israel, why didn't you answer me today? If this sin is mine or my son Jonathan's, Yahweh Elohim of Israel, let the priest draw Urim. But if it is in your people Israel,[e] let him draw Thummim.\u201d Jonathan and Saul were chosen, and the people were freed from guilt.", "42": "\u201cChoose between me and my son Jonathan,\u201d Saul said. Then Jonathan was chosen.", "43": "\u201cTell me,\u201d Saul asked Jonathan. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d So Jonathan told him, \u201cI tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff I had in my hand. And for that I am to die?\u201d", "44": "Saul said, \u201cMay Elohim do worse things to me than are in this curse if you do not die, Jonathan!\u201d", "45": "The troops asked Saul, \u201cShould Jonathan die after he has won this great victory in Israel? That would be unthinkable! We solemnly swear, as Yahweh lives, not a single hair of his head will fall to the ground, because he has done this with Elohim's help today.\u201d So the troops rescued Jonathan from death. ", "46": "Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines. So the Philistines returned to their own land.", "47": "When Saul had taken over the kingdom of Israel, he fought against his enemies on every side\u2014against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he was victorious. ", "48": "He acted forcefully and defeated Amalek. He rescued Israel from the enemies who looted their possessions.", "49": "Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were Merab (the firstborn daughter) and Michal (the younger daughter). ", "50": "The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Saul's uncle Ner. ", "51": "Kish (Saul's father) and Ner (Abner's father) were the sons of Abiel.", "52": "There was intense warfare with the Philistines as long as Saul lived. Whenever any warrior or any skilled fighting man came to Saul's attention, Saul would enlist him in the army."}

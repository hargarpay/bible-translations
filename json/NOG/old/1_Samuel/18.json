Women from all of Israel's cities came to meet King Saul. They sang and danced, accompanied by tambourines, joyful music, and triangles.[a] ", "7": "The women who were celebrating sang, \u201cSaul has defeated thousands but David tens of thousands!\u201d", "8": "Saul became very angry because he considered this saying to be insulting. \u201cTo David they credit tens of thousands,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to me they credit only a few thousand.

I will give her to you as your wife if you prove yourself to be a warrior for me and fight Yahweh's battles.\u201d (Saul thought, \u201cI must not lay a hand on him. Let the Philistines do that.\u201d)", "18": "\u201cWho am I?\u201d David asked Saul. \u201cAnd how important are my relatives or my father's family in Israel that I should be the king's son-in-law?\u201d", "19": "But when the time came to give Saul's daughter Merab to David, she was married to Adriel from Meholah.

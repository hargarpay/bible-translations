{"1": "[a]David went to the priest Ahimelech at Nob. Ahimelech was trembling as he went to meet David. \u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d he asked David. \u201cWhy is no one with you?\u201d", "2": "\u201cThe king ordered me to do something,\u201d David answered the priest Ahimelech, \u201cand he told me, 'No one must know anything about this mission I'm sending you on and about the orders I've given you. I've stationed[b] my young men at a certain place.'\u201d ", "3": "David added, \u201cNow, what do you have to eat? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.\u201d", "4": "\u201cI don't have any ordinary bread,\u201d the chief priest answered David. \u201cBut there is holy bread for the young men if they haven't had sexual intercourse today.\u201d", "5": "David answered the priest, \u201cOf course women have been kept away from us as usual when we go on a mission. The young men's bodies are kept holy even on ordinary campaigns. How much more then will their bodies be holy today?\u201d", "6": "So the priest gave him holy bread because he only had the bread of the presence which had been taken from Yahweh's presence and replaced with warm bread that day.", "7": "That same day one of Saul's servants who was obligated to stay in Yahweh's presence was there. His name was Doeg. A foreman for Saul's shepherds, he was from Edom.", "8": "David asked Ahimelech, \u201cDon't you have a spear or a sword here? I didn't take either my spear or any other weapon because the king's business was urgent.\u201d", "9": "The chief priest answered, \u201cThe sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Elah Valley, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod.[c] If you want to take it, take it. There's no other weapon here.\u201d David said, \u201cThere's none like it. Let me have the sword.\u201d", "10": "That day David left. He was still fleeing from Saul when he came to King Achish of Gath. ", "11": "Achish's officers asked, \u201cIsn't this David, the king of his country? He's the one they used to sing about in the dances: 'Saul has defeated thousands but David tens of thousands.'\u201d", "12": "When David realized what they had said, he was terrified of King Achish of Gath. ", "13": "So he changed his behavior when he was in their presence and acted insane as long as he was under their authority. He scribbled on the doors of the city gate and let his spit run down his beard.", "14": "Achish said to his officers, \u201cLook at him! Don't you see that he's insane? Why bring him to me? ", "15": "Do I have such a shortage of lunatics that you bring this man so that he can show me he is insane? Does this man have to come into my house?\u201d"}

{"1": "Judge me, O Elohim, and plead my case against an ungodly nation. Rescue me from deceitful and unjust people.", "2": "You are my fortress, O Elohim! Why have you rejected me? Why must I walk around in mourning while the enemy oppresses me?", "3": "Send your light and your truth. Let them guide me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling place.", "4": "Then let me go to the altar of Elohim, to God my highest joy, and I will give thanks to you on the lyre, O Elohim, my Elohim.", "5": "Why are you discouraged, my soul? Why are you so restless? Put your hope in Elohim, because I will still praise him. He is my savior and my Elohim."}

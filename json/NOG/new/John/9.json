Did he or his parents sin?\u201d", "3": "Yeshua answered, \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned. Instead, he was born blind so that God could show what he can do for him. ", "4": "We must do what the one who sent me wants us to do while it is day. The night when no one can do anything is coming. ", "5": "As long as I'm in the world, I'm light for the world.\u201d", "6": "After Yeshua said this, he spit on the ground and mixed the spit with dirt. Then he smeared it on the man's eyes ", "7": "and told him, \u201cWash it off in the pool of Siloam.\u201d (Siloam means \u201csent.\u201d) The blind man washed it off and returned.

He's old enough.\u201d)", "24": "So once again the Jews called the man who had been blind. They told him, \u201cGive glory to God.

How did he give you sight?\u201d", "27": "The man replied, \u201cI've already told you, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear the story again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u201d", "28": "The Jews yelled at him, \u201cYou're his disciple, but we're Moses' disciples. ", "29": "We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don't know where this man came from.\u201d", "30": "The man replied to them, \u201cThat's amazing! You don't know where he's from. Yet, he gave me sight. ", "31": "We know that God doesn't listen to sinners. Instead, he listens to people who are devout and who do what he wants.

He is the person who is now talking with you.\u201d", "38": "The man bowed in front of Yeshua and said, \u201cI believe, Lord.\u201d", "39": "Then Yeshua said, \u201cI have come into this world to judge: Blind people will be given sight, and those who can see will become blind.\u201d", "40": "Some Pharisees who were with Yeshua heard this. So they asked him, \u201cDo you think we're blind?\u201d", "41": "Yeshua told them, \u201cIf you were blind, you wouldn't be sinners. But now you say, 'We see,' so you continue to be sinners."}

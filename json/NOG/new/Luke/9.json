Let's put up three tents\u2014one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\u201d Peter didn't know what he was saying.", "34": "While he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them.

The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people.\u201d", "45": "They didn't know what he meant. The meaning was hidden from them so that they didn't understand it. Besides, they were afraid to ask him about what he had said.", "46": "A discussion started among them about who would be the greatest. ", "47": "Yeshua knew what they were thinking. So he took a little child and had him stand beside him. ", "48": "Then he said to them, \u201cWhoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. The one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.\u201d", "49": "John replied, \u201cMaster, we saw someone forcing demons out of a person by using the power and authority of your name. We tried to stop him because he was not one of us.\u201d", "50": "Yeshua said to him, \u201cDon't stop him!

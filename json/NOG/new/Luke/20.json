{"1": "One day Yeshua was teaching the people in the temple courtyard and telling them the Good News. The chief priests, the experts in Moses' Teachings, and the leaders came up to him. ", "2": "They asked him, \u201cTell us, what gives you the right to do these things? Who told you that you could do this?\u201d", "3": "Yeshua answered them, \u201cI, too, have a question for you. Tell me, ", "4": "did John's right to baptize come from heaven or from humans?\u201d", "5": "They talked about this among themselves. They said, \u201cIf we say, 'from heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' ", "6": "But if we say, 'from humans,' everyone will stone us to death. They're convinced that John was a prophet.\u201d ", "7": "So they answered that they didn't know who gave John the right to baptize.", "8": "Yeshua told them, \u201cThen I won't tell you why I have the right to do these things.\u201d", "9": "Then, using this illustration, Yeshua spoke to the people: \u201cA man planted a vineyard, leased it to vineyard workers, and went on a long trip.", "10": "\u201cAt the right time he sent a servant to the workers to obtain from them a share of the grapes from the vineyard. But the workers beat the servant and sent him back with nothing. ", "11": "So he sent a different servant. The workers beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him back with nothing. ", "12": "Then he sent a third servant. But they injured this one and threw him out of the vineyard.", "13": "\u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said, 'What should I do? I'll send my son, whom I love. They'll probably respect him.'", "14": "\u201cWhen the workers saw him, they talked it over among themselves. They said, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.' ", "15": "So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. \u201cWhat will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

If that stone falls on anyone, it will crush that person.\u201d", "19": "The experts in Moses' Teachings and the chief priests wanted to arrest him right there, but they were afraid of the people. They knew that he had directed this illustration at them.", "20": "So they watched for an opportunity to send out some spies. The spies were to act like sincere religious people. They wanted to catch him saying the wrong thing so that they could hand him over to the governor. ", "21": "They asked him, \u201cTeacher, we know that you're right in what you say and teach. Besides, you don't play favorites. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully.

His answer surprised them, so they said no more.", "27": "Some Sadducees, who say that people will never come back to life, came to Yeshua. They asked him, ", "28": "\u201cTeacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry his widow and have children for his brother.' ", "29": "There were seven brothers. The first got married and died without having children. ", "30": "Then the second brother married the widow, ", "31": "and so did the third. In the same way all seven brothers married the widow, died, and left no children. ", "32": "Finally, the woman died. ", "33": "Now, when the dead come back to life, whose wife will she be? The seven brothers had married her.\u201d", "34": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cIn this world people get married.

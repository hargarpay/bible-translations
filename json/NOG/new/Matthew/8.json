The man said to Yeshua, \u201cSir, if you're willing, you can make me clean.\u201d[a]", "3": "Yeshua reached out, touched him, and said, \u201cI'm willing. So be clean!\u201d Immediately, his skin disease went away, and he was clean.", "4": "Yeshua said to him, \u201cDon't tell anyone about this! Instead, show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifice Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.\u201d", "5": "When Yeshua went to Capernaum, a Roman army officer came to beg him for help.

But just give a command, and my servant will be healed. ", "9": "As you know, I'm in a chain of command and have soldiers at my command. I tell one of them, 'Go!' and he goes, and another, 'Come!' and he comes. I tell my servant, 'Do this!' and he does it.\u201d", "10": "Yeshua was amazed when he heard this. He said to those who were following him, \u201cI can guarantee this truth: I haven't found faith as great as this in anyone in Israel.

He forced the evil spirits out of people with a command and cured everyone who was sick. ", "17": "So what the prophet Isaiah had said came true: \u201cHe took away our weaknesses and removed our diseases.\u201d", "18": "Now, when Yeshua saw a crowd around him, he ordered his disciples to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.", "19": "An expert in Moses' Teachings came to him and said, \u201cTeacher, I'll follow you wherever you go.\u201d", "20": "Yeshua told him, \u201cFoxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to sleep.\u201d", "21": "Another disciple said to him, \u201cSir, first let me go to bury my father.\u201d", "22": "But Yeshua told him, \u201cFollow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d", "23": "Yeshua's disciples went with him as he left in a boat. ", "24": "Suddenly, a severe storm came across the sea. The waves were covering the boat. Yet, Yeshua was sleeping.", "25": "So they woke him up, saying, \u201cLord! Save us! We're going to die!\u201d", "26": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cWhy do you cowards have so little faith?\u201d Then he got up, gave an order to the wind and the sea, and the sea became very calm.", "27": "The men were amazed and asked, \u201cWhat kind of man is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!\u201d", "28": "When he arrived in the territory of the Gadarenes on the other side of the Sea of Galilee, two men met him. They were possessed by demons and had come out of the tombs. No one could travel along that road because the men were so dangerous.", "29": "They shouted, \u201cWhy are you bothering us now, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before it is time?\u201d", "30": "A large herd of pigs was feeding in the distance. ", "31": "The demons begged Yeshua, \u201cIf you're going to force us out, send us into that herd of pigs.\u201d", "32": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cGo!\u201d The demons came out and went into the pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. ", "33": "Those who took care of the pigs ran into the city. There they reported everything, especially about the men possessed by demons.", "34": "Everyone from the city went to meet Yeshua. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their territory."}

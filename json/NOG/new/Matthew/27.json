That's your problem.\u201d", "5": "So he threw the money into the temple, went away, and hanged himself.", "6": "The chief priests took the money and said, \u201cIt's not right to put it into the temple treasury, because it's blood money.\u201d ", "7": "So they decided to use it to buy a potter's field for the burial of strangers. ", "8": "That's why that field has been called the Field of Blood ever since. ", "9": "Then what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true, \u201cThey took the 30 silver coins, the price the people of Israel had placed on him, ", "10": "and used the coins to buy a potter's field, as the Lord had directed me.\u201d", "11": "Yeshua stood in front of the governor, Pilate.

Let God rescue him now if he wants. After all, this man said, 'I am the Son of God.'\u201d ", "44": "Even the criminals crucified with him were insulting him the same way.", "45": "At noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. ", "46": "About three o'clock Yeshua cried out in a loud voice, \u201cEli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\u201d which means, \u201cMy God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\u201d ", "47": "When some of the people standing there heard him say that, they said, \u201cHe's calling Elijah.\u201d ", "48": "One of the men ran at once, took a sponge, and soaked it in some vinegar.

Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\u201d", "50": "Then Yeshua loudly cried out once again and gave up his life.", "51": "Suddenly, the curtain in the temple was split in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split open. ", "52": "The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many holy people who had died came back to life. ", "53": "They came out of the tombs after he had come back to life, and they went into the holy city where they appeared to many people.", "54": "An army officer and those watching Yeshua with him saw the earthquake and the other things happening. They were terrified and said, \u201cCertainly, this was the Son of God!\u201d", "55": "Many women were there watching from a distance. They had followed Yeshua from Galilee and had always supported him.

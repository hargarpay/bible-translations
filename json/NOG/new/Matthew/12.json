His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain to eat.", "2": "When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \u201cLook! Your disciples are doing something that is not right to do on the day of worship.\u201d", "3": "Yeshua asked them, \u201cHaven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry? ", "4": "Haven't you read how he went into the house of God and ate[a] the bread of the presence? He and his men had no right to eat those loaves. Only the priests have that right. ", "5": "Or haven't you read in Moses' Teachings that on the day of worship the priests in the temple do things they shouldn't on the day of worship yet remain innocent? ", "6": "I can guarantee that something[b] greater than the temple is here. ", "7": "If you had known what 'I want mercy, not sacrifices' means, you would not have condemned innocent people.", "8": "\u201cThe Son of Man has authority over the day of worship.\u201d", "9": "Yeshua moved on from there and went into a synagogue. ", "10": "A man with a paralyzed hand was there.

If it falls into a pit on a day of worship, wouldn't you take hold of it and lift it out? ", "12": "Certainly, a human is more valuable than a sheep! So it is right to do good on the day of worship.\u201d", "13": "Then he said to the man, \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man held it out, and it became normal again, as healthy as the other.", "14": "The Pharisees left and plotted to kill Yeshua. ", "15": "He knew about this, so he left that place. Many people followed him, and he cured all of them. ", "16": "He also ordered them not to tell people who he was. ", "17": "So what the prophet Isaiah had said came true:", "18": "\u201cHere is my servant whom I have chosen, whom I love, and in whom I delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will announce justice to the nations.", "19": "He will not quarrel or shout, and no one will hear his voice in the streets.", "20": "He will not break off a damaged cattail. He will not even put out a smoking wick until he has made justice victorious.", "21": "The nations will have hope because of him.\u201d", "22": "Then some people brought Yeshua a man possessed by a demon. The demon made the man blind and unable to talk. Yeshua cured him so that he could talk and see.", "23": "The crowds were all amazed and said, \u201cCan this man be the Son of David?\u201d ", "24": "When the Pharisees heard this, they said, \u201cThis man can force demons out of people only with the help of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons.\u201d", "25": "Since Yeshua knew what they were thinking, he said to them, \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is ruined. And every city or household divided against itself will not last. ", "26": "If Satan forces Satan out, he is divided against himself. How, then, can his kingdom last? ", "27": "If I force demons out of people with the help of Beelzebul, who helps your followers force them out? That's why they will be your judges. ", "28": "But if I force demons out with the help of God's Spirit, then the kingdom of God has come to you. ", "29": "How can anyone go into a strong man's house and steal his property? First he must tie up the strong man. Then he can go through his house and steal his property.", "30": "\u201cWhoever isn't with me is against me. Whoever doesn't gather with me scatters.

But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven in this world or the next.", "33": "\u201cMake a tree good, and then its fruit will be good.

Your mouth says what comes from inside you. ", "35": "Good people do the good things that are in them. But evil people do the evil things that are in them.", "36": "\u201cI can guarantee that on judgment day people will have to give an account of every careless word they say.

But the only sign they will get is the sign of the prophet Jonah.

But look, someone greater than Jonah is here! ", "42": "The queen from the south will stand up at the time of judgment with you. She will condemn you, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. But look, someone greater than Solomon is here!", "43": "\u201cWhen an evil spirit comes out of a person, it goes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find any. ", "44": "Then it says, 'I'll go back to the home I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean, and in order. ", "45": "Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before. That is what will happen to the evil people of this day.\u201d", "46": "While Yeshua was still talking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside. They wanted to talk to him.

{"1": "My brothers, practice the faith of our Lord Yeshua, the glorious Messiah, without showing favoritism. ", "2": "Suppose a man comes into your synagogue wearing gold rings and fancy clothes, and also a poor man comes in dressed in rags. ", "3": "If you show more respect to the man wearing the fancy clothes and say to him, \u201cHave this good seat here,\u201d while to the poor man you say, \u201cYou, stand over there,\u201d or, \u201cSit down on the floor by my feet,\u201d ", "4": "then aren't you creating distinctions among yourselves, and haven't you made yourselves into judges with evil motives?", "5": "Listen, my dear brothers, hasn't God chosen the poor of the world to be rich in faith and to receive the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? ", "6": "But you despise the poor! Aren't the rich the ones who oppress you and drag you into court? ", "7": "Aren't they the ones who insult the good name of Him to whom you belong?

", "11": "For the One who said, \u201cDon't commit adultery,\u201d[b] also said, \u201cDon't murder.\u201d[c] Now, if you don't commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the Torah.", "12": "Keep speaking and acting like people who will be judged by a Torah which gives freedom.

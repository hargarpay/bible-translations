{"1": "What is causing all the quarrels and fights among you? Isn't it your desires battling inside you? ", "2": "You desire things and don't have them. You kill, and you are jealous, and you still can't get them. So you fight and quarrel. The reason you don't have is that you don't pray! ", "3": "Or you pray and don't receive, because you pray with the wrong motive, that of wanting to indulge your own desires.", "4": "You unfaithful wives! Don't you know that loving the world is hating God? Whoever chooses to be the world's friend makes himself God's enemy! ", "5": "Or do you suppose the Scripture speaks in vain when it says that there is a spirit in us which longs to envy?

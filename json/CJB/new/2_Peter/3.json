For our fathers have died, and everything goes on just as it has since the beginning of creation.\u201d ", "5": "But, wanting so much to be right about this, they overlook the fact that it was by God's Word that long ago there were heavens, and there was land which arose out of water and existed between the waters, ", "6": "and that by means of these things the world of that time was flooded with water and destroyed. ", "7": "It is by that same Word that the present heavens and earth, having been preserved, are being kept for fire until the Day of Judgment, when ungodly people will be destroyed.", "8": "Moreover, dear friends, do not ignore this: with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day[a] ", "9": "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some people think of slowness; on the contrary, he is patient with you; for it is not his purpose that anyone should be destroyed, but that everyone should turn from his sins.

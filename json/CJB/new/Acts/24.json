{"1": "After five days, the cohen hagadol Hananyah came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they presented their case against Sha'ul to the governor. ", "2": "Sha'ul was called, and Tertullus began to make the charges: \u201cFelix, your Excellency, it is because of you that we enjoy unbroken peace, and it is your foresight that has brought to this nation ", "3": "so many reforms in so many areas. It is with the utmost gratitude that we receive this. ", "4": "But, in order not to take up too much of your time, I beg your indulgence to give us a brief hearing.", "5": "\u201cWe have found this man a pest. He is an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the Natzratim. ", "6": "He even tried to profane the Temple, but we arrested him. ", "7": "[a] ", "8": "By questioning this man yourself, you will be able to learn all about the things of which we are accusing him.\u201d ", "9": "The Judeans also joined in the accusation and alleged that these were the facts.", "10": "When the governor motioned for Sha'ul to speak, he replied, \u201cI know that you have been judge over this nation for a number of years, so I am glad to make my defense. ", "11": "As you can verify for yourself, it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Yerushalayim; ", "12": "and neither in the Temple nor in the synagogues nor anywhere else in the city did they find me either arguing with anyone or collecting a crowd. ", "13": "Nor can they give any proof of the things of which they are accusing me.", "14": "\u201cBut this I do admit to you: I worship the God of our fathers[b] in accordance with the Way (which they call a sect).

{"1": "One afternoon at three o'clock, the hour of minchah prayers, as Kefa and Yochanan were going up to the Temple, ", "2": "a man crippled since birth was being carried in. Every day people used to put him at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, so that he could beg from those going into the Temple court. ", "3": "When he saw Kefa and Yochanan about to enter, he asked them for some money. ", "4": "But they stared straight at him; and Kefa said, \u201cLook at us!\u201d ", "5": "The crippled man fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. ", "6": "Kefa said, \u201cI don't have silver, and I don't have gold, but what I do have I give to you: in the name of the Messiah, Yeshua of Natzeret, walk!\u201d ", "7": "And taking hold of him by his right hand, Kefa pulled him up. Instantly his feet and ankles became strong; ", "8": "so that he sprang up, stood a moment, and began walking. Then he entered the Temple court with them, walking and leaping and praising God! ", "9": "Everyone saw him walking and praising God. ", "10": "They recognized him as the same man who had formerly sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, and they were utterly amazed and confounded at what had happened to him. ", "11": "While he clung to Kefa and Yochanan, all the people came running in astonishment toward them in Shlomo's Colonnade.", "12": "Seeing this, Kefa addressed the people: \u201cMen of Isra'el! Why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us as if we had made this man walk through some power or godliness of our own?

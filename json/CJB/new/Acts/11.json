{"1": "The emissaries and the brothers throughout Y'hudah heard that the Goyim had received the word of God; ", "2": "but when Kefa went up to Yerushalayim, the members of the Circumcision faction criticized him, ", "3": "saying, \u201cYou went into the homes of uncircumcised men and even ate with them!\u201d", "4": "In reply, Kefa began explaining in detail what had actually happened: ", "5": "\u201cI was in the city of Yafo, praying; and in a trance I had a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners from heaven, and it came down to me. ", "6": "I looked inside and saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, crawling creatures and wild birds. ", "7": "Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Kefa, slaughter and eat!' ", "8": "I said, 'No, sir! Absolutely not! Nothing unclean or treif has ever entered my mouth!' ", "9": "But the voice spoke again from heaven: 'Stop treating as unclean what God has made clean.' ", "10": "This happened three times, and then everything was pulled back up into heaven.", "11": "\u201cAt that very moment, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying; ", "12": "and the Spirit told me to have no misgivings about going back with them. These six brothers also came with me, and we went into the man's house. ", "13": "He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, 'Send to Yafo and bring back Shim'on, known as Kefa. ", "14": "He has a message for you which will enable you and your whole household to be saved.'", "15": "\u201cBut I had hardly begun speaking when the Ruach HaKodesh fell on them, just as on us at the beginning! ", "16": "And I remembered that the Lord had said, 'Yochanan used to immerse people in water, but you will be immersed in the Ruach HaKodesh.' ", "17": "Therefore, if God gave them the same gift as he gave us after we had come to put our trust in the Lord Yeshua the Messiah, who was I to stand in God's way?\u201d", "18": "On hearing these things, they stopped objecting and began to praise God, saying, \u201cThis means that God has enabled the Goyim as well to do t'shuvah and have life!\u201d", "19": "Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution which had arisen over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch; they spoke God's word, but only to Jews. ", "20": "However, some of these, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, when they arrived at Antioch, began speaking to the Greeks too, proclaiming the Good News of the Lord Yeshua. ", "21": "The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people trusted and turned to the Lord.", "22": "News of this reached the ears of the Messianic community in Yerushalayim, and they sent Bar-Nabba to Antioch. ", "23": "On arriving and seeing for himself the grace of God at work, he was glad; and he encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with their whole hearts; ", "24": "for he was a good man, full of the Ruach HaKodesh and trust.", "25": "Then Bar-Nabba went off to Tarsus to look for Sha'ul; ", "26": "and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. They met with the congregation there for a whole year and taught a sizeable crowd. Also it was in Antioch that the talmidim for the first time were called \u201cMessianic.\u201d", "27": "During this time, some prophets came down from Yerushalayim to Antioch; ", "28": "and one of them named Agav stood up and through the Spirit predicted that there was going to be a severe famine throughout the Roman Empire. (It took place while Claudius was Emperor.) ", "29": "So the talmidim decided to provide relief to the brothers living in Y'hudah, each according to his means; ", "30": "and they did it, sending their contribution to the elders in the care of Bar-Nabba and Sha'ul."}

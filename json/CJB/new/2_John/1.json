{"1": "From: The Elder To: The chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth \u2014 and not only I but also all who have come to know the truth \u2014 ", "2": "because of the Truth which remains united with us and will be with us forever:", "3": "Grace, mercy and shalom will be with us from God the Father and from Yeshua the Messiah, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.", "4": "I was very happy when I found some of your children living in truth, just as the Father commanded us. ", "5": "And now, dear lady, I am requesting that we love one another \u2014 not as if this were a new command I am writing you, for it is the one which we have had from the beginning. ", "6": "Moreover, love is this: that we should live according to his commands. This is the command, as you people have heard from the beginning; live by it!", "7": "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, people who do not acknowledge Yeshua the Messiah's coming as a human being. Such a person is a deceiver and an anti-Messiah. ", "8": "Watch yourselves, so that you won't lose what you have worked for, but will receive your full reward. ", "9": "Everyone who goes ahead and does not remain true to what the Messiah has taught does not have God. Those who remain true to his teaching have both the Father and the Son. ", "10": "If someone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, don't welcome him into your home. Don't even say, \u201cShalom!\u201d to him; ", "11": "for the person who says, \u201cShalom!\u201d to him shares in his evil deeds.", "12": "Although I have much to write you people, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and see you and to talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.", "13": "The children of your chosen sister send you their greetings."}

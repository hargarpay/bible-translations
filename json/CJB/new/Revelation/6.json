He was given a great sword.", "5": "When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, \u201cGo!\u201d I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales. ", "6": "Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, \u201cTwo pounds of wheat for a day's wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don't damage the oil or the wine!\u201d", "7": "When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, \u201cGo!\u201d ", "8": "I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider's name was Death, and Sh'ol followed behind him.

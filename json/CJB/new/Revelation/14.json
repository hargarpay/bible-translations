", "3": "They were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who have been ransomed from the world.

Bavel the Great![a] She made all the nations drink the wine of God's fury caused by her whoring!\u201d", "9": "Another angel, a third one, followed them and said in a loud voice, \u201cIf anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand, ", "10": "he will indeed drink the wine of God's fury poured undiluted into the cup of his rage. He will be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb, ", "11": "and the smoke from their tormenting goes up forever and ever. They have no rest, day or night, those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of its name.\u201d ", "12": "This is when perseverance is needed on the part of God's people, those who observe his commands and exercise Yeshua's faithfulness.", "13": "Next I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u201cWrite: 'How blessed are the dead who die united with the Lord, from now on!'

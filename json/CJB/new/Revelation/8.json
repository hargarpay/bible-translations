", "2": "Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven shofars. ", "3": "Another angel came and stood at the altar with a gold incense-bowl, and he was given a large quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all God's people ", "4": "on the gold altar in front of the throne. The smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of God's people from the hand of the angel before God. ", "5": "Then the angel took the incense-bowl, filled it with fire from the altar and threw it down onto the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, voices, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.", "6": "Now the seven angels with the seven shofars prepared to sound them.", "7": "The first one sounded his shofar; and there came hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was thrown down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.", "8": "The second angel sounded his shofar, and what looked like an enormous blazing mountain was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood, ", "9": "a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.", "10": "The third angel sounded his shofar; and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky onto a third of the rivers and onto the springs of water.

Woe! Woe to the people living on earth, because of the remaining blasts from the three angels who have yet to sound their shofars!\u201d"}

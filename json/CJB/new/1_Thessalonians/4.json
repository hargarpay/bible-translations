", "2": "For you know what instructions we gave you on the authority of the Lord Yeshua. ", "3": "What God wants is that you be holy, that you keep away from sexual immorality, ", "4": "that each of you know how to manage his sexual impulses in a holy and honorable manner, ", "5": "without giving in to lustful desires, like the pagans who don't know God. ", "6": "No one should wrong his brother in this matter or take advantage of him, because the Lord punishes all who do such things \u2014 as we have explained to you before at length.

{"1": "Then what advantage has the Jew? What is the value of being circumcised? ", "2": "Much in every way! In the first place, the Jews were entrusted with the very words of God. ", "3": "If some of them were unfaithful, so what? Does their faithlessness cancel God's faithfulness? ", "4": "Heaven forbid! God would be true even if everyone were a liar! \u2014 as the Tanakh says, \u201cso that you, God, may be proved right in your words and win the verdict when you are put on trial.\u201d[a]", "5": "Now if our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness, what should we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict his anger on us? (I am speaking here the way people commonly do.) ", "6": "Heaven forbid! Else, how could God judge the world? ", "7": "\u201cBut,\u201d you say, \u201cif, through my lie, God's truth is enhanced and brings him greater glory, why am I still judged merely for being a sinner?\u201d ", "8": "Indeed! Why not say (as some people slander us by claiming we do say), \u201cLet us do evil, so that good may come of it\u201d? Against them the judgment is a just one!", "9": "So are we Jews better off? Not entirely; for I have already made the charge that all people, Jews and Gentiles alike, are controlled by sin. ", "10": "As the Tanakh puts it, \u201cThere is no one righteous, not even one!

", "20": "For in his sight no one alive will be considered righteous[h] on the ground of legalistic observance of Torah commands, because what Torah really does is show people how sinful they are.", "21": "But now, quite apart from Torah, God's way of making people righteous in his sight has been made clear \u2014 although the Torah and the Prophets give their witness to it as well \u2014 ", "22": "and it is a righteousness that comes from God, through the faithfulness of Yeshua the Messiah, to all who continue trusting.

None at all! What kind of Torah excludes it? One that has to do with legalistic observance of rules? No, rather, a Torah that has to do with trusting.

Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, he is indeed the God of the Gentiles; ", "30": "because, as you will admit, God is one.[i] Therefore, he will consider righteous the circumcised on the ground of trusting and the uncircumcised through that same trusting.

", "3": "Do nothing out of rivalry or vanity; but, in humility, regard each other as better than yourselves \u2014 ", "4": "look out for each other's interests and not just for your own.", "5": "Let your attitude toward one another be governed by your being in union with the Messiah Yeshua:", "6": "Though he was in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God something to be possessed by force.", "7": "On the contrary, he emptied himself, in that he took the form of a slave by becoming like human beings are. And when he appeared as a human being,", "8": "he humbled himself still more by becoming obedient even to death \u2014 death on a stake as a criminal!", "9": "Therefore God raised him to the highest place and gave him the name above every name;", "10": "that in honor of the name given Yeshua, every knee will bow \u2014 in heaven, on earth and under the earth \u2014", "11": "and every tongue will acknowledge[a] that Yeshua the Messiah is Adonai \u2014 to the glory of God the Father.", "12": "So, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed when I was with you, it is even more important that you obey now when I am away from you: keep working out your deliverance with fear and trembling,[b] ", "13": "for God is the one working among you both the willing and the working for what pleases him. ", "14": "Do everything without kvetching or arguing, ", "15": "so that you may be blameless and pure children of God, without defect in the midst of a twisted and perverted generation,[c] among whom you shine like stars in the sky, ", "16": "as you hold on to the Word of Life. If you do this, I will be able to boast, when the Day of the Messiah comes, that I did not run or toil for nothing. ", "17": "Indeed, even if my lifeblood is poured out as a drink offering over the sacrifice and service of your faith, I will still be glad and rejoice with you all.

", "27": "Indeed he was ill, close to death; but God had mercy on him \u2014 and not only on him, but also on me \u2014 otherwise I would have had sorrow piled on sorrow. ", "28": "Therefore, I am all the more eager to send him, so that you may rejoice when you see him again; and I, for my part, may be less sad.

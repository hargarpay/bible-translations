{"1": "From: Sha'ul, an emissary \u2014 I received my commission not from human beings or through human mediation but through Yeshua the Messiah and God the Father, who raised him from the dead \u2014 also from all the brothers with me", "2": "To: The Messianic communities in Galatia:", "3": "Grace and shalom to you from God our Father and from the Lord Yeshua the Messiah, ", "4": "who gave himself for our sins, so that he might deliver us from the present evil world-system, in obedience to the will of God, our Father.

Amen.", "6": "I am astounded that you are so quick to remove yourselves from me, the one who called you by the Messiah's grace, and turn to some other supposedly \u201cGood News,\u201d ", "7": "which is not good news at all! What is really happening is that certain people are pestering you and trying to pervert the genuine Good News of the Messiah. ", "8": "But even if we \u2014 or, for that matter, an angel from heaven! \u2014 were to announce to you some so-called \u201cGood News\u201d contrary to the Good News we did announce to you, let him be under a curse forever!

No! I want God's approval! Or that I'm trying to cater to people? If I were still doing that, I would not be a servant of the Messiah.", "11": "Furthermore, let me make clear to you, brothers, that the Good News as I proclaim it is not a human product; ", "12": "because neither did I receive it from someone else nor was I taught it \u2014 it came through a direct revelation from Yeshua the Messiah.

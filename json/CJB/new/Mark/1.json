{"1": "The beginning of the Good News of Yeshua the Messiah, the Son of God:", "2": "It is written in the prophet Yesha'yahu, \u201cSee, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare the way before you.\u201d[a]", "3": "\u201cThe voice of someone crying out: 'In the desert prepare the way for Adonai! Make straight paths for him!'\u201d[b]", "4": "So it was that Yochanan the Immerser appeared in the desert, proclaiming an immersion involving turning to God from sin in order to be forgiven. ", "5": "People went out to him from all over Y'hudah, as did all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. Confessing their sins, they were immersed by him in the Yarden River. ", "6": "Yochanan wore clothes of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; he ate locusts and wild honey. ", "7": "He proclaimed: \u201cAfter me is coming someone who is more powerful than I \u2014 I'm not worthy even to bend down and untie his sandals. ", "8": "I have immersed you in water, but he will immerse you in the Ruach HaKodesh.\u201d", "9": "Shortly thereafter, Yeshua came from Natzeret in the Galil and was immersed in the Yarden by Yochanan. ", "10": "Immediately upon coming up out of the water, he saw heaven torn open and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove; ", "11": "then a voice came from heaven, \u201cYou are my Son, whom I love; I am well pleased with you.\u201d", "12": "Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness, ", "13": "and he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by the Adversary. He was with the wild animals, and the angels took care of him.", "14": "After Yochanan had been arrested, Yeshua came into the Galil proclaiming the Good News from God:", "15": "\u201cThe time has come, God's Kingdom is near! Turn to God from your sins and believe the Good News!\u201d", "16": "As he walked beside Lake Kinneret, he saw Shim'on and Andrew, Shim'on's brother, casting a net into the lake; for they were fishermen. ", "17": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cCome, follow me, and I will make you into fishers for men!\u201d ", "18": "At once they left their nets and followed him.", "19": "Going on a little farther, he saw Ya'akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan, his brother, in their boat, repairing their nets. ", "20": "Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zavdai in the boat with the hired men and went after Yeshua.", "21": "They entered K'far-Nachum, and on Shabbat Yeshua went into the synagogue and began teaching. ", "22": "They were amazed at the way he taught, for he did not instruct them like the Torah-teachers but as one who had authority himself.", "23": "In their synagogue just then was a man with an unclean spirit in him, who shouted, ", "24": "\u201cWhat do you want with us, Yeshua from Natzeret? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \u2014 the Holy One of God!\u201d ", "25": "But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit, \u201cBe quiet and come out of him!\u201d ", "26": "Throwing the man into a convulsion, it gave a loud shriek and came out of him. ", "27": "They were all so astounded that they began asking each other, \u201cWhat is this? A new teaching, one with authority behind it! He gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they obey him!\u201d ", "28": "And the news about him spread quickly through the whole region of the Galil.", "29": "They left the synagogue and went with Ya'akov and Yochanan to the home of Shim'on and Andrew. ", "30": "Shim'on's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever, and they told Yeshua about her. ", "31": "He came, took her by the hand and lifted her onto her feet. The fever left her, and she began helping them.", "32": "That evening after sundown, they brought to Yeshua all who were ill or held in the power of demons, ", "33": "and the whole town came crowding around the door. ", "34": "He healed many who were ill with various diseases and expelled many demons, but he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.", "35": "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Yeshua got up, left, went away to a lonely spot and stayed there praying. ", "36": "But Shim'on and those with him went after him; ", "37": "and when they found him, they said, \u201cEverybody is looking for you.\u201d ", "38": "He answered, \u201cLet's go somewhere else \u2014 to the other villages around here. I have to proclaim the message there too \u2014 in fact this is why I came out.\u201d ", "39": "So he traveled all through the Galil, preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.", "40": "A man afflicted with tzara'at came to Yeshua and begged him on his knees, \u201cIf you are willing, you can make me clean.\u201d ", "41": "Moved with pity, Yeshua reached out his hand, touched him and said to him, \u201cI am willing! Be cleansed!\u201d ", "42": "Instantly the tzara'at left him, and he was cleansed. ", "43": "Yeshua sent him away with this stern warning: ", "44": "\u201cSee to it that you tell no one; instead, as a testimony to the people, go and let the cohen examine you, and offer for your cleansing what Moshe commanded.\u201d ", "45": "But he went out and began spreading the news, talking freely about it; so that Yeshua could no longer enter a town openly but stayed out in the country, where people continued coming to him from all around."}

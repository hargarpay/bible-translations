Yeshua called his talmidim to him and said to them, ", "2": "\u201cI feel sorry for these people, because they have been with me three days, and now they have nothing to eat. ", "3": "If I send them off to their homes hungry, they will collapse on the way; some of them have come a long distance.\u201d ", "4": "His talmidim said to him, \u201cHow can anyone find enough bread to satisfy these people in a remote place like this?\u201d ", "5": "\u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d he asked them. They answered, \u201cSeven.\u201d ", "6": "He then told the crowd to sit down on the ground, took the seven loaves, made a b'rakhah, broke the loaves and gave them to his talmidim to serve to the people. ", "7": "They also had a few fish; making a b'rakhah over them he also ordered these to be served. ", "8": "The people ate their fill; and the talmidim took up the leftover pieces, seven large basketsful. ", "9": "About four thousand were there. ", "10": "After sending them away, Yeshua got into the boat with his talmidim and went off to the district of Dalmanuta.", "11": "The P'rushim came and began arguing with him; they wanted him to give them a sign from Heaven, because they were out to trap him. ", "12": "With a sigh that came straight from his heart, he said, \u201cWhy does this generation want a sign? Yes! I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation!\u201d ", "13": "With that, he left them, got into the boat again and went off to the other side of the lake.", "14": "Now the talmidim had forgotten to bring bread and had with them in the boat only one loaf. ", "15": "So when Yeshua said to them, \u201cWatch out! Guard yourselves from the hametz of the P'rushim and the hametz of Herod,\u201d ", "16": "they thought he had said it because they had no bread. ", "17": "But, aware of this, he said, \u201cWhy are you talking with each other about having no bread? Don't you see or understand yet? Have your hearts been made like stone? ", "18": "You have eyes \u2014 don't you see? You have ears \u2014 don't you hear? And don't you remember?

He spit in his eyes, put his hands on him and asked him, \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d ", "24": "He looked up and said, \u201cI see people, but they look like walking trees.\u201d ", "25": "Then he put his hands on the blind man's eyes again. He peered intently, and his eyesight was restored, so that he could see everything distinctly. ", "26": "Yeshua sent him home with the words, \u201cDon't go into town.\u201d", "27": "Yeshua and his talmidim went on to the towns of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked his talmidim, \u201cWho are people saying I am?\u201d ", "28": "\u201cSome say you are Yochanan the Immerser,\u201d they told him, \u201cothers say Eliyahu, and still others, one of the prophets.\u201d ", "29": "\u201cBut you,\u201d he asked, \u201cwho do you say I am?\u201d Kefa answered, \u201cYou are the Mashiach.\u201d ", "30": "Then Yeshua warned them not to tell anyone about him. ", "31": "He began teaching them that the Son of Man had to endure much suffering and be rejected by the elders, the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers; and that he had to be put to death; but that after three days, he had to rise again.

", "38": "For if someone is ashamed of me and of what I say in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."}

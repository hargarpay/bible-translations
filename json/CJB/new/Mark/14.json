She broke the jar and poured the perfume over Yeshua's head. ", "4": "But some there angrily said to themselves, \u201cWhy this waste of perfume? ", "5": "It could have been sold for a year's wages and given to the poor!\u201d And they scolded her. ", "6": "But he said, \u201cLet her be. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. ", "7": "For you will always have the poor with you; and whenever you want to, you can help them. But you will not always have me. ", "8": "What she could do, she did do \u2014 in advance she poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial. ", "9": "Yes! I tell you that wherever in the whole world this Good News is proclaimed, what she has done will be told in her memory.\u201d", "10": "Then Y'hudah from K'riot, who was one of the Twelve, went to the head cohanim in order to betray Yeshua to them. ", "11": "They were pleased to hear this and promised to give him money. And he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Yeshua.", "12": "On the first day for matzah, when they slaughtered the lamb for Pesach, Yeshua's talmidim asked him, \u201cWhere do you want us to go and prepare your Seder?\u201d ", "13": "He sent two of his talmidim with these instructions: \u201cGo into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him; ", "14": "and whichever house he enters, tell him that the Rabbi says, 'Where is the guest room for me, where I am to eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim?' ", "15": "He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the preparations there.\u201d ", "16": "The talmidim went off, came to the city and found things just as he had told them they would be; and they prepared the Seder.", "17": "When evening came, Yeshua arrived with the Twelve. ", "18": "As they were reclining and eating, Yeshua said, \u201cYes! I tell you that one of you is going to betray me.\u201d ", "19": "They became upset and began asking him, one after the other, \u201cYou don't mean me, do you?\u201d ", "20": "\u201cIt's one of the Twelve,\u201d he said to them, \u201csomeone dipping matzah in the dish with me. ", "21": "For the Son of Man will die, just as the Tanakh says he will; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him had he never been born!\u201d", "22": "While they were eating, Yeshua took a piece of matzah, made the b'rakhah, broke it, gave it to them and said, \u201cTake it! This is my body.\u201d ", "23": "Also he took a cup of wine, made the b'rakhah, and gave it to them; and they all drank.

I tell you, I will not drink this 'fruit of the vine' again until the day I drink new wine in the Kingdom of God.\u201d", "26": "After singing the Hallel, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

I tell you that this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times!\u201d ", "31": "But Kefa kept insisting, \u201cEven if I must die with you, I will never disown you!\u201d And they all said the same thing.", "32": "They went to a place called Gat Sh'manim; and Yeshua said to his talmidim, \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ", "33": "He took with him Kefa, Ya'akov and Yochanan. Great distress and anguish came over him; ", "34": "and he said to them, \u201cMy heart is so filled with sadness that I could die! Remain here and stay awake.\u201d ", "35": "Going on a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that if possible, the hour might pass from him: ", "36": "\u201cAbba!\u201d (that is, \u201cDear Father!\u201d) \u201cAll things are possible for you.

Couldn't you stay awake one hour? ", "38": "Stay awake, and pray that you will not be put to the test \u2014 the spirit indeed is eager, but human nature is weak.\u201d", "39": "Again he went away and prayed, saying the same words; ", "40": "and again he came and found them sleeping, their eyes were so very heavy; and they didn't know what to answer him.", "41": "The third time, he came and said to them, \u201cFor now, go on sleeping, take your rest. . . .There, that's enough! The time has come! Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners! ", "42": "Get up! Let's go! Here comes my betrayer!\u201d", "43": "While Yeshua was still speaking, Y'hudah (one of the Twelve!) came, and with him a crowd carrying swords and clubs, from the head cohanim, the Torah-teachers and the elders.

Grab him, and take him away under guard.\u201d ", "45": "As he arrived, he went right up to Yeshua, said, \u201cRabbi!\u201d and kissed him. ", "46": "Then they laid hold of Yeshua and arrested him; ", "47": "but one of the people standing nearby drew his sword and struck at the servant of the cohen hagadol, cutting off his ear.", "48": "Yeshua addressed them: \u201cSo you came out to take me with swords and clubs, the way you would the leader of a rebellion? ", "49": "Every day I was with you in the Temple court, teaching, and you didn't seize me then! But let the Tanakh be fulfilled.\u201d ", "50": "And they all deserted him and ran away. ", "51": "There was one young man who did try to follow him; but he was wearing only a nightshirt; and when they tried to seize him, ", "52": "he slipped out of the nightshirt and ran away naked.", "53": "They led Yeshua to the cohen hagadol, with whom all the head cohanim, elders and Torah-teachers were assembling. ", "54": "Kefa followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the cohen hagadol, where he sat down with the guards and warmed himself by the fire.", "55": "The head cohanim and the whole Sanhedrin tried to find evidence against Yeshua, so that they might have him put to death, but they couldn't find any. ", "56": "For many people gave false evidence against him, but their testimonies didn't agree.

Again the cohen hagadol questioned him: \u201cAre you the Mashiach, Ben-HaM'vorakh?\u201d ", "62": "\u201cI AM,\u201d answered Yeshua. \u201cMoreover, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of HaG'vurah and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d[b] ", "63": "At this, the cohen hagadol tore his clothes and said, \u201cWhy do we still need witnesses? ", "64": "You heard him blaspheme! What is your decision?\u201d And they all declared him guilty and subject to the death penalty.", "65": "Then some began spitting at him; and after blindfolding him, they started pounding him with their fists and saying to him, \u201cLet's see you prophesy!\u201d And as the guards took him, they beat him too.", "66": "Meanwhile, Kefa was still in the courtyard below. One of the serving-girls of the cohen hagadol ", "67": "saw Kefa warming himself, took a look at him, and said, \u201cYou were with the man from Natzeret, Yeshua!\u201d ", "68": "But he denied it, saying, \u201cI haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about!\u201d He went outside into the entryway, and a rooster crowed. ", "69": "The girl saw him there and started telling the bystanders, \u201cThis fellow is one of them.\u201d ", "70": "Again he denied it. A little later, the bystanders themselves said to Kefa, \u201cYou must be one of them, because you're from the Galil.\u201d ", "71": "At this he began to invoke a curse on himself as he swore, \u201cI do not know this man you are telling me about!\u201d \u2014 ", "72": "and immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Kefa remembered what Yeshua had said to him, \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.\u201d And throwing himself down, he burst into tears."}

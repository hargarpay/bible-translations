", "4": "Now the Judean festival of Pesach was coming up; ", "5": "so when Yeshua looked up and saw that a large crowd was approaching, he said to Philip, \u201cWhere will we be able to buy bread, so that these people can eat?\u201d ", "6": "(Now Yeshua said this to test Philip, for Yeshua himself knew what he was about to do.) ", "7": "Philip answered, \u201cHalf a year's wages wouldn't buy enough bread for them \u2014 each one would get only a bite!\u201d ", "8": "One of the talmidim, Andrew the brother of Shim'on Kefa, said to him, ", "9": "\u201cThere's a young fellow here who has five loaves of barley bread and two fish. But how far will they go among so many?\u201d", "10": "Yeshua said, \u201cHave the people sit down.\u201d There was a lot of grass there, so they sat down. The number of men was about five thousand.

", "12": "After they had eaten their fill, he told his talmidim, \u201cGather the leftover pieces, so that nothing gets wasted.\u201d ", "13": "They gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.", "14": "When the people saw the miracle he had performed, they said, \u201cThis has to be 'the prophet' who is supposed to come into the world.\u201d ", "15": "Yeshua knew that they were on the point of coming and seizing him, in order to make him king; so he went back to the hills again. This time he went by himself.", "16": "When evening came, his talmidim went down to the lake, ", "17": "got into a boat and set out across the lake toward K'far-Nachum. By now it was dark, Yeshua had not yet joined them, ", "18": "and the sea was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing. ", "19": "They had rowed three or four miles when they saw Yeshua approaching the boat, walking on the lake! They were terrified; ", "20": "but he said to them, \u201cStop being afraid, it is I.\u201d ", "21": "Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and instantly the boat reached the land they were heading for.", "22": "The next day, the crowd which had stayed on the other side of the lake noticed that there had been only one boat there, and that Yeshua had not entered the boat with his talmidim, but that the talmidim had been alone when they sailed off. ", "23": "Then other boats, from Tiberias, came ashore near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had made the b'rakhah. ", "24": "Accordingly, when the crowd saw that neither Yeshua nor his talmidim were there, they themselves boarded the boats and made for K'far-Nachum in search of Yeshua.", "25": "When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \u201cRabbi, when did you get here?\u201d ", "26": "Yeshua answered, \u201cYes, indeed! I tell you, you're not looking for me because you saw miraculous signs, but because you ate the bread and had all you wanted! ", "27": "Don't work for the food which passes away but for the food that stays on into eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For this is the one on whom God the Father has put his seal.\u201d", "28": "So they said to him, \u201cWhat should we do in order to perform the works of God?\u201d ", "29": "Yeshua answered, \u201cHere's what the work of God is: to trust in the one he sent!\u201d", "30": "They said to him, \u201cNu, what miracle will you do for us, so that we may see it and trust you? What work can you perform? ", "31": "Our fathers ate man in the desert \u2014 as it says in the Tanakh, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'[a] ", "32": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cYes, indeed!

I tell you, whoever trusts has eternal life: ", "48": "I am the bread which is life. ", "49": "Your fathers ate the man in the desert; they died.

{"1": "As Yeshua passed along, he saw a man blind from birth. ", "2": "His talmidim asked him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned \u2014 this man or his parents \u2014 to cause him to be born blind?\u201d ", "3": "Yeshua answered, \u201cHis blindness is due neither to his sin nor to that of his parents; it happened so that God's power might be seen at work in him. ", "4": "As long as it is day, we must keep doing the work of the One who sent me; the night is coming, when no one can work. ", "5": "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u201d", "6": "Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, put the mud on the man's eyes, ", "7": "and said to him, \u201cGo, wash off in the Pool of Shiloach!\u201d (The name means \u201csent.\u201d) So he went and washed and came away seeing.", "8": "His neighbors and those who previously had seen him begging said, \u201cIsn't this the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d ", "9": "Some said, \u201cYes, he's the one\u201d; while others said, \u201cNo, but he looks like him.\u201d However, he himself said, \u201cI'm the one.\u201d ", "10": "\u201cHow were your eyes opened?\u201d they asked him. ", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe man called Yeshua made mud, put it on my eyes, and told me, 'Go to Shiloach and wash!' So I went; and as soon as I had washed, I could see.\u201d ", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d and he replied, \u201cI don't know.\u201d", "13": "They took the man who had been blind to the P'rushim. ", "14": "Now the day on which Yeshua had made the mud and opened his eyes was Shabbat. ", "15": "So the P'rushim asked him again how he had become able to see; and he told them, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes, then I washed, and now I can see.\u201d ", "16": "At this, some of the P'rushim said, \u201cThis man is not from God, because he doesn't keep Shabbat.\u201d But others said, \u201cHow could a man who is a sinner do miracles like these?\u201d And there was a split among them. ", "17": "So once more they spoke to the blind man: \u201cSince you're the one whose eyes he opened, what do you say about him?\u201d He replied: \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d", "18": "The Judeans, however, were unwilling to believe that he had formerly been blind, but now could see, until they had summoned the man's parents. ", "19": "They asked them, \u201cIs this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\u201d ", "20": "His parents answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son and that he was born blind; ", "21": "but how it is that he can see now, we don't know; nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him \u2014 he's old enough, he can speak for himself!\u201d ", "22": "The parents said this because they were afraid of the Judeans, for the Judeans had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged Yeshua as the Messiah would be banned from the synagogue. ", "23": "This is why his parents said, \u201cHe's old enough, ask him.\u201d", "24": "So a second time they called the man who had been blind; and they said to him, \u201cSwear to God that you will tell the truth! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d ", "25": "He answered, \u201cWhether he's a sinner or not I don't know. One thing I do know: I was blind, now I see.\u201d ", "26": "So they said to him, \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ", "27": "\u201cI already told you,\u201d he answered, \u201cand you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Maybe you too want to become his talmidim?\u201d ", "28": "Then they railed at him. \u201cYou may be his talmid,\u201d they said, \u201cbut we are talmidim of Moshe! ", "29": "We know that God has spoken to Moshe, but as for this fellow \u2014 we don't know where he's from!\u201d ", "30": "\u201cWhat a strange thing,\u201d the man answered, \u201cthat you don't know where he's from \u2014 considering that he opened my eyes!

He found him and said, \u201cDo you trust in the Son of Man?\u201d ", "36": "\u201cSir,\u201d he answered, \u201ctell me who he is, so that I can trust in him.\u201d ", "37": "Yeshua said to him, \u201cYou have seen him. In fact, he's the one speaking with you now.\u201d ", "38": "\u201cLord, I trust!\u201d he said, and he kneeled down in front of him.", "39": "Yeshua said, \u201cIt is to judge that I came into this world, so that those who do not see might see, and those who do see might become blind.\u201d ", "40": "Some of the P'rushim nearby heard this and said to him, \u201cSo we're blind too, are we?\u201d ", "41": "Yeshua answered them, \u201cIf you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But since you still say, 'We see,' your guilt remains."}

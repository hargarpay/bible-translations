{"1": "After this, Yeshua appeared again to the talmidim at Lake Tiberias. Here is how it happened: ", "2": "Shim'on Kefa and T'oma (his name means \u201ctwin\u201d) were together with Natan'el from Kanah in the Galil, the sons of Zavdai, and two other talmidim. ", "3": "Shim'on Kefa said, \u201cI'm going fishing.\u201d They said to him, \u201cWe're coming with you.\u201d They went and got into the boat, but that night they didn't catch anything. ", "4": "However, just as day was breaking, Yeshua stood on shore, but the talmidim didn't know it was he. ", "5": "He said to them, \u201cYou don't have any fish, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they answered him. ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cThrow in your net to starboard and you will catch some.\u201d So they threw in their net, and there were so many fish in it that they couldn't haul it aboard. ", "7": "The talmid Yeshua loved said to Kefa, \u201cIt's the Lord!\u201d On hearing it was the Lord, Shim'on Kefa threw on his coat, because he was stripped for work, and plunged into the lake; ", "8": "but the other talmidim followed in the boat, dragging the net full of fish; for they weren't far from shore, only about a hundred yards. ", "9": "When they stepped ashore, they saw a fire of burning coals with a fish on it, and some bread. ", "10": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cBring some of the fish you have just caught.\u201d ", "11": "Shim'on Kefa went up and dragged the net ashore. It was full of fish, 153 of them; but even with so many, the net wasn't torn. ", "12": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d None of the talmidim dared to ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord. ", "13": "Yeshua came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. ", "14": "This was now the third time Yeshua had appeared to the talmidim after being raised from the dead.", "15": "After breakfast, Yeshua said to Shim'on Kefa, \u201cShim'on Bar-Yochanan, do you love me more than these?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes, Lord, you know I'm your friend.\u201d He said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ", "16": "A second time he said to him, \u201cShim'on Bar-Yochanan, do you love me?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes, Lord, you know I'm your friend.\u201d He said to him, \u201cShepherd my sheep.\u201d ", "17": "The third time he said to him, \u201cShim'on Bar-Yochanan, are you my friend?\u201d Shim'on was hurt that he questioned him a third time: \u201cAre you my friend?\u201d So he replied, \u201cLord, you know everything! You know I'm your friend!\u201d Yeshua said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep! ", "18": "Yes, indeed! I tell you, when you were younger, you put on your clothes and went where you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.\u201d ", "19": "He said this to indicate the kind of death by which Kefa would bring glory to God. Then Yeshua said to him, \u201cFollow me!\u201d", "20": "Kefa turned and saw the talmid Yeshua especially loved following behind, the one who had leaned against him at the supper and had asked, \u201cWho is the one who is betraying you?\u201d ", "21": "On seeing him, Kefa said to Yeshua, \u201cLord, what about him?\u201d ", "22": "Yeshua said to him, \u201cIf I want him to stay on until I come, what is it to you? You, follow me!\u201d ", "23": "Therefore the word spread among the brothers that that talmid would not die. However, Yeshua didn't say he wouldn't die, but simply, \u201cIf I want him to stay on until I come, what is it to you?\u201d", "24": "This one is the talmid who is testifying about these things and who has recorded them. And we know that his testimony is true.", "25": "But there are also many other things Yeshua did; and if they were all to be recorded, I don't think the whole world could contain the books that would have to be written!"}

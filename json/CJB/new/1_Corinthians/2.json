{"1": "As for me, brothers, when I arrived among you, it was not with surpassing eloquence or wisdom that I came announcing to you the previously concealed truth about God; ", "2": "for I had decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Yeshua the Messiah, and even him only as someone who had been executed on a stake as a criminal. ", "3": "Also I myself was with you as somebody weak, nervous and shaking all over from fear; ", "4": "and neither the delivery nor the content of my message relied on compelling words of \u201cwisdom\u201d but on a demonstration of the power of the Spirit, ", "5": "so that your trust might not rest on human wisdom but on God's power.", "6": "Yet there is a wisdom that we are speaking to those who are mature enough for it. But it is not the wisdom of this world or of this world's leaders, who are in the process of passing away. ", "7": "On the contrary, we are communicating a secret wisdom from God which has been hidden until now but which, before history began, God had decreed would bring us glory. ", "8": "Not one of this world's leaders has understood it; because if they had, they would not have executed the Lord from whom this glory flows. ", "9": "But, as the Tanakh says, \u201cNo eye has seen, no ear has heard and no one's heart has imagined all the things that God has prepared for those who love him.\u201d[a]", "10": "It is to us, however, that God has revealed these things. How? Through the Spirit. For the Spirit probes all things, even the profoundest depths of God. ", "11": "For who knows the inner workings of a person except the person's own spirit inside him? So too no one knows the inner workings of God except God's Spirit. ", "12": "Now we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit of God, so that we might understand the things God has so freely given us. ", "13": "These are the things we are talking about when we avoid the manner of speaking that human wisdom would dictate and instead use a manner of speaking taught by the Spirit, by which we explain things of the Spirit to people who have the Spirit. ", "14": "Now the natural man does not receive the things from the Spirit of God \u2014 to him they are nonsense! Moreover, he is unable to grasp them, because they are evaluated through the Spirit. ", "15": "But the person who has the Spirit can evaluate everything, while no one is in a position to evaluate him.", "16": "For who has known the mind of Adonai? Who will counsel him?[b] But we have the mind of the Messiah!"}

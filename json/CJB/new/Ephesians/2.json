{"1": "You used to be dead because of your sins and acts of disobedience. ", "2": "You walked in the ways of the 'olam hazeh and obeyed the Ruler of the Powers of the Air, who is still at work among the disobedient. ", "3": "Indeed, we all once lived this way \u2014 we followed the passions of our old nature and obeyed the wishes of our old nature and our own thoughts. In our natural condition we were headed for God's wrath, just like everyone else.", "4": "But God is so rich in mercy and loves us with such intense love ", "5": "that, even when we were dead because of our acts of disobedience, he brought us to life along with the Messiah \u2014 it is by grace that you have been delivered. ", "6": "That is, God raised us up with the Messiah Yeshua and seated us with him in heaven, ", "7": "in order to exhibit in the ages to come how infinitely rich is his grace, how great is his kindness toward us who are united with the Messiah Yeshua. ", "8": "For you have been delivered by grace through trusting, and even this is not your accomplishment but God's gift. ", "9": "You were not delivered by your own actions; therefore no one should boast. ", "10": "For we are of God's making, created in union with the Messiah Yeshua for a life of good actions already prepared by God for us to do.", "11": "Therefore, remember your former state: you Gentiles by birth \u2014 called the Uncircumcised by those who, merely because of an operation on their flesh, are called the Circumcised \u2014 ", "12": "at that time had no Messiah. You were estranged from the national life of Isra'el. You were foreigners to the covenants embodying God's promise.

He did this in order to create in union with himself from the two groups a single new humanity and thus make shalom, ", "16": "and in order to reconcile to God both in a single body by being executed on a stake as a criminal and thus in himself killing that enmity.", "17": "Also, when he came, he announced as Good News shalom to you far off and shalom to those nearby,[a] ", "18": "news that through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.", "19": "So then, you are no longer foreigners and strangers. On the contrary, you are fellow-citizens with God's people and members of God's family.

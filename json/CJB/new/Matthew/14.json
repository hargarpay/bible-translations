{"1": "Around that time, Herod, the regional governor, heard of the fame of Yeshua ", "2": "and said to his attendants, \u201cThis must be Yochanan the Immerser. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\u201d", "3": "For Herod had arrested Yochanan, put him in chains and thrown him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip; ", "4": "since Yochanan had told Herod, \u201cIt violates the Torah for you to have her as your wife.\u201d ", "5": "Herod had wanted to put Yochanan to death; but he was afraid of the people, in whose eyes Yochanan was a prophet. ", "6": "However, at Herod's birthday celebration, Herodias' daughter danced before the company and pleased Herod so much ", "7": "that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. ", "8": "Prompted by her mother, she said, \u201cGive me here on a platter the head of Yochanan the Immerser.\u201d ", "9": "The king became deeply upset; but out of regard for the oaths he had sworn before his dinner guests, he ordered that her wish be granted, ", "10": "and sent and had Yochanan beheaded in prison. ", "11": "The head was brought on a platter to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. ", "12": "Yochanan's talmidim came, took the body and buried it; then they went and told Yeshua.", "13": "On hearing about this, Yeshua left in a boat to be by himself in the wilderness. But the people learned of it and followed him from the towns by land. ", "14": "So when he came ashore, he saw a huge crowd; and, filled with compassion for them, he healed those of them who were sick.", "15": "As evening approached, the talmidim came to him and said, \u201cThis is a remote place and it's getting late. Send the crowds away, so that they can go and buy food for themselves in the villages.\u201d ", "16": "But Yeshua replied, \u201cThey don't need to go away. Give them something to eat, yourselves!\u201d ", "17": "\u201cAll we have with us,\u201d they said, \u201cis five loaves of bread and two fish.\u201d ", "18": "He said, \u201cBring them here to me.\u201d ", "19": "After instructing the crowds to sit down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up toward heaven, made a b'rakhah. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the talmidim, who gave them to the crowds. ", "20": "They all ate as much as they wanted, and they took up twelve baskets full of the pieces left over. ", "21": "Those eating numbered about five thousand men, plus women and children.", "22": "Immediately he had the talmidim get in the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away. ", "23": "After he had sent the crowds away, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. Night came on, and he was there alone. ", "24": "But by this time, the boat was several miles from shore, battling a rough sea and a headwind. ", "25": "Around four o'clock in the morning, he came toward them, walking on the lake! ", "26": "When the talmidim saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. \u201cIt's a ghost!\u201d they said and screamed with fear. ", "27": "But at once Yeshua spoke to them. \u201cCourage,\u201d he said, \u201cit is I. Stop being afraid.\u201d ", "28": "Then Kefa called to him, \u201cLord, if it is really you, tell me to come to you on the water.\u201d ", "29": "\u201cCome!\u201d he said. So Kefa got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Yeshua. ", "30": "But when he saw the wind, he became afraid; and as he began to sink, he yelled, \u201cLord! Save me!\u201d ", "31": "Yeshua immediately stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, \u201cSuch little trust! Why did you doubt?\u201d ", "32": "As they went up into the boat, the wind ceased. ", "33": "The men in the boat fell down before him and exclaimed, \u201cYou really are God's son!\u201d", "34": "Having made the crossing, they landed at Ginosar. ", "35": "When the people of the place recognized him, they sent word throughout the neighborhood and brought him everyone who was ill. ", "36": "They begged him that the sick people might only touch the tzitzit on his robe, and all who touched it were completely healed."}

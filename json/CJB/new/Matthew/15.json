They don't do n'tilat-yadayim before they eat!\u201d ", "3": "He answered, \u201cIndeed, why do you break the command of God by your tradition? ", "4": "For God said, 'Honor your father and mother,'[a] and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'[b] ", "5": "But you say, 'If anyone says to his father or mother, \u201cI have promised to give to God what I might have used to help you,\u201d ", "6": "then he is rid of his duty to honor his father or mother.' Thus by your tradition you make null and void the word of God! ", "7": "You hypocrites! Yesha'yahu was right when he prophesied about you,", "8": "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far away from me.", "9": "Their worship of me is useless, because they teach man-made rules as if they were doctrines.'\u201d[c]", "10": "Then he called the crowd to him and said, \u201cListen and understand this!

", "18": "But what comes out of your mouth is actually coming from your heart, and that is what makes a person unclean. ", "19": "For out of the heart come forth wicked thoughts, murder, adultery and other kinds of sexual immorality, theft, lies, slanders. . . .

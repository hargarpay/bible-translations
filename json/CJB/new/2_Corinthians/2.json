{"1": "So I made up my mind that I would not pay you another painful visit. ", "2": "For if I cause you pain, who is left to make me happy except the people I have pained? ", "3": "Indeed, this is why I wrote as I did \u2014 so that when I came, I would not have to be pained by those who ought to be making me happy; for I had enough confidence in all of you to believe that unless I could be happy, none of you could be happy either. ", "4": "I wrote to you with a greatly distressed and anguished heart, and with many tears, not in order to cause you pain, but to get you to realize how very much I love you.", "5": "Now if someone has been a cause of pain, it is not I whom he has pained, but, in some measure \u2014 I don't want to overstate it \u2014 all of you. ", "6": "For such a person the punishment already imposed on him by the majority is sufficient, ", "7": "so that now you should do the opposite \u2014 forgive him, encourage him, comfort him. Otherwise such a person might be swallowed up in overwhelming depression. ", "8": "So I urge you to show that you really do love him. ", "9": "The reason I wrote you was to see if you would pass the test, to see if you would fully obey me. ", "10": "Anyone you forgive, I forgive too. For indeed, whatever I have forgiven, if there has been anything to forgive, has been for your sake in the presence of the Messiah ", "11": "so that we will not be taken advantage of by the Adversary \u2014 for we are quite aware of his schemes!", "12": "Now when I went to Troas to proclaim the Good News of the Messiah, since a door had been opened for me by the Lord, ", "13": "I could not rest, because I failed to find my brother Titus. So I left the people there and went on to Macedonia.", "14": "But thanks be to God, who in the Messiah constantly leads us in a triumphal procession and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of what it means to know him! ", "15": "For to God we are the aroma of the Messiah, both among those being saved and among those being lost; ", "16": "to the latter, we are the smell of death leading only to more death; but to the former, we are the sweet smell of life leading to more life. Who is equal to such a task? ", "17": "For we are not like a lot of folks who go about huckstering God's message for a fee; on the contrary, we speak out of a sincere heart, as people sent by God, standing in God's presence, living in union with the Messiah."}

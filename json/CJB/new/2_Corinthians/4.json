{"1": "God has shown us such mercy that we do not lose courage as we do the work he has given us. ", "2": "Indeed, we refuse to make use of shameful underhanded methods, employing deception or distorting God's message. On the contrary, by making very clear what the truth is, we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. ", "3": "So if indeed our Good News is veiled, it is veiled only to those in the process of being lost. ", "4": "They do not come to trust because the god of the 'olam hazeh has blinded their minds, in order to prevent them from seeing the light shining from the Good News about the glory of the Messiah, who is the image of God. ", "5": "For what we are proclaiming is not ourselves, but the Messiah Yeshua as Lord, with ourselves as slaves for you because of Yeshua. ", "6": "For it is the God who once said, \u201cLet light shine out of darkness,\u201d who has made his light shine in our hearts, the light of the knowledge of God's glory shining in the face of the Messiah Yeshua.", "7": "But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that it will be evident that such overwhelming power comes from God and not from us.

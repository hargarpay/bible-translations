", "4": "They were standing there, not knowing what to think about it, when suddenly two men in dazzlingly bright clothing stood next to them. ", "5": "Terror-stricken, they bowed down with their faces to the ground. The two men said to them, \u201cWhy are you looking for the living among the dead?

The Lord has risen! Shim'on saw him!\u201d ", "35": "Then the two told what had happened on the road and how he had become known to them in the breaking of the matzah.", "36": "They were still talking about it when \u2014 there he was, standing among them! ", "37": "Startled and terrified, they thought they were seeing a ghost. ", "38": "But he said to them, \u201cWhy are you so upset? Why are these doubts welling up inside you?

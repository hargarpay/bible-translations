", "4": "Whatever house you enter, stay there and go out from there. ", "5": "Wherever they don't welcome you, shake the dust from your feet when you leave that town as a warning to them.\u201d ", "6": "They set out and went through village after village, healing and announcing the Good News everywhere.", "7": "Herod the governor heard about all that was going on and was perplexed, because it was said by some that Yochanan had been raised from the dead, ", "8": "by others that Eliyahu had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. ", "9": "Herod said, \u201cI had Yochanan beheaded, so who is this about whom I keep hearing such things?\u201d And he began trying to see him.", "10": "On their return, the emissaries detailed to Yeshua what they had done. Then, taking them with him, he withdrew by himself to a town called Beit-Tzaidah. ", "11": "But the crowds found out and followed him. Welcoming them, he went on to speak to them about the Kingdom of God and to heal those who needed to be healed.", "12": "The day began to draw to a close. The Twelve came to him and said, \u201cSend the crowd away, so that they can go and get lodging and food in the towns and farms around here, because where we are is a remote place.\u201d ", "13": "But he said to them, \u201cGive them something to eat, yourselves!\u201d They said, \u201cWe have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish \u2014 unless we ourselves are supposed to go and buy food for all these people!\u201d ", "14": "(For there were about five thousand men.) He said to his talmidim, \u201cMake them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d ", "15": "They did what he told them and had them all sit down. ", "16": "Then he took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up toward heaven, made a b'rakhah, broke the loaves and began giving them to the talmidim to distribute to the crowd. ", "17": "Everyone ate as much as he wanted; and they took up what was left over, twelve baskets full of broken pieces.", "18": "Once when Yeshua was praying in private, his talmidim were with him; and he asked them, \u201cWho are the crowds saying I am?\u201d ", "19": "They answered, \u201cYochanan the Immerser; but others say Eliyahu, and others that some prophet of long ago has risen.\u201d ", "20": "\u201cBut you,\u201d he said to them, \u201cwho do you say I am?\u201d Kefa answered, \u201cThe Mashiach of God!\u201d ", "21": "However, he, warning them, ordered them to tell this to no one, ", "22": "adding, \u201cThe Son of Man has to endure much suffering and be rejected by the elders, the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers; and he has to be put to death; but on the third day, he has to be raised to life.\u201d", "23": "Then to everyone he said, \u201cIf anyone wants to come after me, let him say 'No' to himself, take up his execution-stake daily and keep following me.

", "29": "As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed; and his clothing became gleaming white. ", "30": "Suddenly there were two men talking with him \u2014 Moshe and Eliyahu! ", "31": "They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke of his exodus, which he was soon to accomplish in Yerushalayim. ", "32": "Kefa and those with him had been sound asleep; but on becoming fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. ", "33": "As the men were leaving Yeshua, Kefa said to him, not knowing what he was saying, \u201cIt's good that we're here, Rabbi! Let's put up three shelters \u2014 one for you, one for Moshe and one for Eliyahu.\u201d ", "34": "As he spoke, a cloud came and enveloped them. They were frightened as they entered the cloud; ", "35": "and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to him!\u201d ", "36": "When the voice spoke, Yeshua was alone once more.

", "38": "Suddenly a man in the crowd shouted, \u201cRabbi! Look at my son, I beg you, because he's my only child! ", "39": "What happens is this: a spirit seizes him, and suddenly it lets out a shriek and throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth; and only with difficulty will it leave him. It's destroying him!

Bring your son here.\u201d ", "42": "Even as the boy was coming, the demon dashed him to the ground and threw him into a fit. But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. ", "43": "All were struck with amazement at the greatness of God. While they were all marvelling at everything Yeshua was doing, he said to his talmidim, ", "44": "\u201cListen very carefully to what I'm going to say. The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.\u201d ", "45": "But they didn't understand what he meant by this. It had been concealed from them so that they would not grasp its meaning, and they were afraid to ask him about it.", "46": "An argument arose among the talmidim as to which of them might be the greatest. ", "47": "But Yeshua, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, took a child, stood him beside himself, ", "48": "and said to them, \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the One who sent me. In other words, the one who is least among you all \u2014 this is the one who is great.\u201d ", "49": "Yochanan responded, \u201cRabbi, we saw someone expelling demons in your name; and we stopped him because he doesn't follow you along with us.\u201d ", "50": "Yeshua said to him, \u201cDon't stop such people, because whoever isn't against you is for you.\u201d", "51": "As the time approached for him to be taken up into heaven, he made his decision to set out for Yerushalayim.

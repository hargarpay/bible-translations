", "3": "Hearing about Yeshua, the officer sent some Jewish elders to him with the request that he come and heal his servant. ", "4": "They came to Yeshua and pleaded earnestly with him, \u201cHe really deserves to have you do this, ", "5": "for he loves our people \u2014 in fact, he built the synagogue for us!\u201d ", "6": "So Yeshua went with them. He had not gone far from the house, when the officer sent friends who said to him, \u201cSir, don't trouble yourself. I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof \u2014 ", "7": "this is why I didn't presume to approach you myself. Instead, just give a command and let my servant recover. ", "8": "For I too am a man set under authority. I have soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it.\u201d ", "9": "Yeshua was astonished at him when he heard this; and he turned and said to the crowd following him, \u201cI tell you, not even in Isra'el have I found such trust!\u201d ", "10": "When the messengers got back to the officer's house, they found the servant in good health.", "11": "The next day Yeshua, accompanied by his talmidim and a large crowd, went to a town called Na'im.

", "13": "When the Lord saw her, he felt compassion for her and said to her, \u201cDon't cry.\u201d ", "14": "Then he came close and touched the coffin, and the pallbearers halted. He said, \u201cYoung man, I say to you: get up!\u201d ", "15": "The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Yeshua gave him to his mother.[a] ", "16": "They were all filled with awe and gave glory to God, saying, \u201cA great prophet has appeared among us,\u201d and, \u201cGod has come to help his people.\u201d ", "17": "This report about him spread throughout all Y'hudah and the surrounding countryside.", "18": "Yochanan's talmidim informed him of all these things.

", "26": "Nu, so what did you go out to see? A prophet! Yes, and I tell you he's much more than a prophet. ", "27": "This is the one about whom the Tanakh says, 'See, I am sending out my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way before you.'[c]", "28": "I tell you that among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than Yochanan the Immerser! Yet the one who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he!\u201d", "29": "All the people who heard him, even the tax-collectors, by undergoing Yochanan's immersion acknowledged that God was right; ", "30": "but the P'rushim and the Torah-teachers, by not letting themselves be immersed by him, nullified for themselves God's plan.", "31": "\u201cTherefore,\u201d said the Lord, \u201chow can I describe the people of this generation? What are they like? ", "32": "They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling to one another, 'We made happy music, but you wouldn't dance! We made sad music, but you wouldn't cry!'", "33": "For Yochanan has come not eating bread and not drinking wine; and you say, 'He has a demon!'

Then she wiped his feet with her own hair, kissed his feet and poured the perfume on them.", "39": "When the Parush who had invited him saw what was going on, he said to himself, \u201cIf this man were really a prophet, he would have known who is touching him and what sort of woman she is, that she is a sinner.\u201d ", "40": "Yeshua answered, \u201cShim'on, I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cSay it, Rabbi,\u201d he replied.

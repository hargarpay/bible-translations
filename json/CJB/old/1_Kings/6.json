{"1": "It was in the 480th year after the people of Isra'el had left the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Shlomo's reign over Isra'el, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Adonai. ", "2": "The house which King Shlomo built for Adonai was 105 feet long, thirty-five feet wide and fifty-two-and-a-half feet high. ", "3": "The hall fronting the temple of the house was thirty-five feet long, the same as the width of the house itself, so that its seventeen-and-a-half-foot width extended frontward from the house. ", "4": "The windows he made for the house were wide on the inside and narrow on the outside. ", "5": "Against the wall of the house he built an annex all the way around; it went all the way around the walls of the house, including both the temple and the sanctuary. ", "6": "The lowest floor of the annex was eight-and-three-quarters feet wide, the middle floor ten-and-a-half feet wide and the third floor twelve-and-a-quarter feet wide; for he had made the outer part of the wall of the house step-shaped, so that the beams of the annex would not have to be attached to the house walls. ", "7": "For the house, when under construction, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; so that no hammer, chisel or iron tool of any kind was heard in the house while it was being built. ", "8": "The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the house; a spiral staircase went up to the middle floor and on to the third. ", "9": "So he built the house, and after finishing it, he put its roof on \u2014 cedar planks over beams. ", "10": "Each floor of the annex surrounding the house was eight-and-three-quarters feet high and was attached to the house with beams of cedar.", "11": "Then this word of Adonai came to Shlomo: ", "12": "\u201cConcerning this house which you are building: if you will live according to my regulations, follow my rulings and observe all my mitzvot and live by them, then I will establish with you my promise that I made to David your father \u2014 ", "13": "I will live in it among the people of Isra'el, and I will not abandon my people Isra'el.\u201d", "14": "So Shlomo finished building the house. ", "15": "The insides of the walls of the house he built with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the joists of the ceiling he covered them on the inside with wood, and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. ", "16": "The thirty-five-foot back portion of the house he built with boards of cedar from the floor to the joists and reserved this part of the house to be a sanctuary, the Especially Holy Place; ", "17": "while the rest of the house, that is, the temple in front, was seventy feet long. ", "18": "The cedar covering the house was carved with gourds and open flowers; all was cedar; no stone was visible. ", "19": "In the inner part of the house he set up the sanctuary, so that the ark for the covenant of Adonai could be placed there. ", "20": "This sanctuary was thirty-five feet long, wide and high; and it was overlaid with pure gold. In front of it he set an altar, which he covered with cedar. ", "21": "Shlomo overlaid the interior of the house with pure gold and had chains of gold placed before the sanctuary, which itself he overlaid with gold. ", "22": "The entire house he overlaid with gold until it was completely covered with it. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the sanctuary.", "23": "Inside the sanctuary he made two k'ruvim of olive-wood, each seventeen-and-a-half feet high. ", "24": "Each of the two wings of one of the k'ruvim was eight-and-three quarters feet long, so that the distance from the end of one wing to the end of the other was seventeen-and-a-half feet. ", "25": "Likewise the [wingspread of the] other keruv was seventeen-and-a-half feet; both k'ruvim were identical in shape and size. ", "26": "The height of the one keruv was seventeen-and-a-half feet, likewise that of the other. ", "27": "He set the k'ruvim in the inner house; the wings of the k'ruvim were stretched out, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other keruv touched the other wall; their wings touched each other in the middle of the house. ", "28": "He overlaid the k'ruvim with gold. ", "29": "All around the walls of the house, both inside the sanctuary and outside it, he carved figures of k'ruvim, palm trees and open flowers. ", "30": "He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, both inside the sanctuary and outside it.", "31": "For the entrance to the sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, set within a five-sided door-frame. ", "32": "On the two olive-wood doors he carved figures of k'ruvim, palm trees and open flowers. He overlaid the doors with gold, forcing the gold into the shapes of the k'ruvim and palm trees as well. ", "33": "For the entrance to the temple he also made doorposts of olive-wood, set within a rectangular door-frame, ", "34": "and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, as were the two leaves of the other. ", "35": "On them he carved k'ruvim, palm trees and open flowers, overlaying them with gold fitted to the carved work. ", "36": "He built the inner courtyard with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams.", "37": "The foundation of the house of Adonai was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv. ", "38": "In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, all parts of the house were completed exactly as designed. Thus he was seven years building it."}

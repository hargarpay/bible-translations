", "3": "He had 700 wives, all princesses, and 300 concubines; and his wives turned his heart away. ", "4": "For when Shlomo became old, his wives turned his heart away toward other gods; so that he was not wholehearted with Adonai his God, as David his father had been. ", "5": "For Shlomo followed 'Ashtoret the goddess of the Tzidoni and Milkom the abomination of the 'Amoni. ", "6": "Thus Shlomo did what was evil in Adonai's view and did not fully follow Adonai, as David his father had done. ", "7": "Shlomo built a high place for K'mosh the abomination of Mo'av on the hill on front of Yerushalayim, and another for Molekh the abomination of the people of 'Amon. ", "8": "This is what he did for all his foreign wives, who then offered and sacrificed to their gods. ", "9": "So Adonai grew angry with Shlomo, because his heart had turned away from Adonai the God of Isra'el, who had appeared to him twice ", "10": "and given him orders concerning this matter that he should not follow other gods. But he didn't obey Adonai's orders.", "11": "So Adonai said to Shlomo, \u201cSince this is what has been in your mind, and you haven't kept my covenant and my regulations which I ordered you to obey, I will tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.

He gave Hadad a house, saw to it that he had food and gave him land.

Rezon rallied men to himself and became the leader of a band of marauders; they went to Dammesek and settled there, while he became king of Dammesek. ", "25": "He remained an adversary as long as Shlomo lived, causing difficulties in addition to those of Hadad. He detested Isra'el and ruled Aram.", "26": "Also Yarov'am the son of N'vat, an Efrati from Tz'redah, whose mother's name was Tz'ru'ah, one of Shlomo's servants, rebelled against the king. ", "27": "Here is the reason he rebelled against the king: Shlomo was building the Millo and closing the breach in [the wall of] the City of David his father.

Achiyah was wearing a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in open country. ", "30": "Achiyah took hold of his new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. ", "31": "Then he said to Yarov'am, \u201cTake ten pieces for yourself!

In exchange I will give you a better vineyard; or, if you prefer, I will give you its monetary value.\u201d ", "3": "But Navot said to Ach'av, \u201cAdonai forbid that I should give you my ancestral heritage!\u201d ", "4": "Ach'av went home resentful and depressed at what Navot the Yizre'eli had said to him, since he had said, \u201cI won't give you my ancestral heritage.\u201d He lay down on his bed, turned his face away and refused to eat.

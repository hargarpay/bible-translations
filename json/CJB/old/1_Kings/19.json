{"1": "Ach'av told Izevel everything Eliyahu had done and how he had put all the prophets to the sword. ", "2": "Then Izevel sent a messenger to say to Eliyahu, \u201cMay the gods do terrible things to me and worse ones besides if by this time tomorrow I haven't taken your life, just as you took theirs!\u201d ", "3": "On seeing that, he got up and fled for his life. When he arrived in Be'er-Sheva, in Y'hudah, he left his servant there; ", "4": "but he himself went a day farther into the desert, until he came to a broom tree. He sat down under it and prayed for his own death. \u201cEnough!\u201d he said. \u201cNow, Adonai, take my life. I'm no better than my ancestors.\u201d ", "5": "Then he lay down under the broom tree and went to sleep. Suddenly, an angel touched him and said to him, \u201cGet up and eat!\u201d ", "6": "He looked, and there by his head was a cake baked on the hot stones and a jug of water. He ate and drank, then lay down again. ", "7": "The angel came again, a second time, touched him and said, \u201cGet up and eat, or the journey will be too much for you.\u201d ", "8": "He got up, ate and drank, and, on the strength of that meal, traveled forty days and nights until he reached Horev the mountain of God.", "9": "There he went into a cave and spent the night. Then the word of Adonai came to him; he said to him, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Eliyahu?\u201d ", "10": "He answered, \u201cI have been very zealous for Adonai the God of armies, because the people of Isra'el have abandoned your covenant, broken down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. Now I'm the only one left, and they're coming after me to kill me too.\u201d ", "11": "He said, \u201cGo outside, and stand on the mountain before Adonai\u201d; and right then and there, Adonai went past. A mighty blast of wind tore the mountains apart and broke the rocks in pieces before Adonai, but Adonai was not in the wind. After the wind came an earthquake, but Adonai was not in the earthquake. ", "12": "After the earthquake, fire broke out; but Adonai was not in the fire. And after the fire came a quiet, subdued voice. ", "13": "When Eliyahu heard it, he covered his face with his cloak, stepped out and stood at the entrance to the cave. Then a voice came to him and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Eliyahu?\u201d ", "14": "He answered, \u201cI have been very zealous for Adonai the God of armies; because the people of Isra'el have abandoned your covenant, broken down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. Now I'm the only one left, and they're after me to kill me too.\u201d", "15": "Adonai said to him, \u201cGo back by way of the Dammesek Desert. When you get there, anoint Haza'el to be king over Aram. ", "16": "Also anoint Yehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Isra'el, and anoint Elisha the son of Shafat of Avel-M'cholah to be prophet after you. ", "17": "Yehu will kill whoever escapes the sword of Haza'el, and Elisha will kill whoever escapes the sword of Yehu. ", "18": "Still, I will spare seven thousand in Isra'el, every knee that hasn't bent down before Ba'al and every mouth that has not kissed him.\u201d", "19": "So he left and found Elisha the son of Shafat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen; he himself was behind the twelfth. Eliyahu went over to him and threw his cloak on him. ", "20": "He left the oxen, ran after Eliyahu and said, \u201cPlease let me kiss my father and mother good-bye; then I will follow you.\u201d He answered, \u201cGo; but return, because of what I did to you.\u201d ", "21": "Elisha stopped following him. Then he took the yoke of oxen, slaughtered them, cooked their meat over the wooden yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up, went after Eliyahu and became his servant."}

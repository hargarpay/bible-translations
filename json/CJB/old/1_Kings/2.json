He laid a terrible curse on me when I was on my way to Machanayim; but he came down to meet me at the Yarden; so I swore to him by Adonai that I would not have him put to death with the sword.

No matter; the kingdom has turned around and become my brother's, because Adonai gave it to him. ", "16": "But now I ask one favor of you; don't deny me.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d she said.

Ask the kingdom for him too! After all, he's my older brother! Yes, for him, and for Evyatar the cohen and for Yo'av the son of Tz'ruyah!\u201d ", "23": "Then King Shlomo swore by Adonai, \u201cMay God do terrible things to me and worse if Adoniyah hasn't condemned himself to death with this request!

You deserve to die; but I won't put you to death just now; since you did carry the ark of Adonai Elohim before David my father; and you suffered together with my father in everything he suffered.\u201d ", "27": "So Shlomo forced Evyatar out of his task as cohen to Adonai, so that what Adonai had said in Shiloh about the family of 'Eli might be fulfilled.", "28": "When the news came to Yo'av, he fled to the tent of Adonai and took hold of the horns of the altar; for Yo'av had given his support to Adoniyah, even though he had not supported Avshalom.

In this way you will take away from me and my father's family the blood which Yo'av shed for no reason.

They told Shim'i, \u201cYour slaves are in Gat.\u201d ", "40": "So Shim'i set out, saddled his donkey and went to Akhish in Gat to look for his slaves; then Shim'i returned, bringing his slaves from Gat.", "41": "Shlomo was told that Shim'i had gone from Yerushalayim to Gat and back.

", "43": "Why, then, haven't you kept the oath of Adonai and the mitzvah I charged you with?\u201d ", "44": "Moreover, the king said to Shim'i, \u201cYou know in your own heart all the terrible things you did to David my father; therefore Adonai will bring back your wickedness on your own head. ", "45": "But King Shlomo will be blessed, and the throne of David will be established before Adonai forever.\u201d ", "46": "So the king gave the order to B'nayah the son of Y'hoyada, and he went out and struck him down, so that he died. Thus the kingdom was established in Shlomo's hands."}

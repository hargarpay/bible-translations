Adonai has a case against his people; he wants to argue it out with Isra'el:", "3": "\u201cMy people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Answer me!", "4": "I brought you up from the land of Egypt. I redeemed you from a life of slavery. I sent Moshe, Aharon and Miryam to lead you.", "5": "My people, just remember what Balak the king of Mo'av had planned, what Bil'am the son of B'or answered him, [and what happened] between Sheetim and Gilgal \u2014 so that you will understand the saving deeds of Adonai.\u201d", "6": "\u201cWith what can I come before Adonai to bow down before God on high?

You will conceive but not give birth; if you do give birth, I will give him to the sword.", "15": "You will sow but will not reap, you will press olives but not rub yourself with oil, likewise you will press grapes but not drink the wine.", "16": "For you keep the regulations of 'Omri and all the practices of the house of Ach'av, modeling yourselves on their advice. Therefore I will make you an object of horror, the inhabitants of this city a cause for contempt; you will suffer the insults aimed at my people.\u201d"}

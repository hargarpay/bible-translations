{"1": "This is a prophecy about Ninveh, the book of the vision of Nachum the Elkoshi:", "2": "Adonai is a jealous and vengeful God. Adonai avenges; he knows how to be angry. Adonai takes vengeance on his foes and stores up wrath for his enemies.", "3": "Adonai is slow to anger, but great in power; and he does not leave the guilty unpunished. Adonai's path is in the whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.", "4": "He rebukes the sea and leaves it dry, he dries up all the rivers. Bashan and the Karmel languish; the flower of the L'vanon withers.", "5": "The mountains quake before him, and the hills dissolve; the earth collapses in his presence, the world and everyone living in it.", "6": "Who can withstand his fury? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, the rocks broken to pieces before him.", "7": "Adonai is good, a stronghold in time of trouble; he takes care of those who take refuge in him.", "8": "But with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of [Ninveh's] place, and darkness will pursue his enemies.", "9": "What are you planning against Adonai? He is making an end [of it]; trouble will not arise a second time.", "10": "For like men drunk with liquor, they will be burned up like tangled thorns, like straw completely dry.", "11": "Out of you, [Ninveh,] he came, one who plots evil against Adonai, who counsels wickedness.", "12": "Here is what Adonai says: \u201cThough they be many and strong, they will be cut down, they will pass; and though I have made you suffer, I will make you suffer no more.", "13": "Now I will break his yoke from your necks and snap the chains that bind you.", "14": "Adonai gave this order concerning you: you will have no descendants to bear your name; from the house of your god I will cut off carved image and cast metal image; I will prepare your grave, because you are worthless.\u201d"}

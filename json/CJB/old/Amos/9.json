Those who remain I will kill with the sword; not one of them will succeed in fleeing, not one of them will escape.", "2": "If they dig down to Sh'ol, my hand will haul them out; if they climb up to heaven, I will bring them down.", "3": "If they hide themselves on the top of the Karmel, I will search them out and capture them there; If they hide from me at the bottom of the sea, I will order the serpent to bite them there.", "4": "If their enemies herd them into exile, I will order the sword to kill them there. I will fix my gaze on them for harm and not for good.\u201d", "5": "For Adonai Elohim-Tzva'ot is the one who can melt the earth with his touch, and make all who live on it mourn. It will all rise, just like the Nile, and then subside, like the Nile in Egypt.", "6": "He builds his upper rooms in heaven and establishes his sky-vault over the earth.

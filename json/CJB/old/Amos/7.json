{"1": "Here is what Adonai Elohim showed me: he was forming a swarm of locusts as the late crop was starting to come up, the late crop after the hay had been cut to pay the king's tribute. ", "2": "While they were finishing up eating all the vegetation in the land, I said, \u201cAdonai Elohim, forgive \u2014 please! How will tiny Ya'akov survive?\u201d", "3": "So Adonai changed his mind about this. \u201cIt won't happen,\u201d Adonai said.", "4": "Next Adonai Elohim showed me this: Adonai Elohim was summoning a blazing fire to consume the great abyss, and it would have devoured the land too. ", "5": "But I said, \u201cAdonai Elohim, stop \u2014 please! How will tiny Ya'akov survive?\u201d", "6": "Adonai changed his mind about it. \u201cThis too won't happen,\u201d said Adonai Elohim.", "7": "Then he showed me this: Adonai was standing by a wall made with a plumbline, and he had a plumbline in his hand. ", "8": "Adonai asked me, \u201c'Amos, what do you see?\u201d I answered, \u201cA plumbline.\u201d Then Adonai said, \u201cI am going to put a plumbline in among my people Isra'el; I will never again overlook their offenses.", "9": "The high places of Yitz'chak will be desolate, Isra'el's sanctuaries will be destroyed, and I will attack the house of Yarov'am with the sword.\u201d", "10": "Then Amatzyah the priest of Beit-El sent this message to Yarov'am king of Isra'el, \u201c'Amos is conspiring against you there among the people of Isra'el, and the land can't bear all that he's saying. ", "11": "For 'Amos says: 'Yarov'am will die by the sword, and Isra'el will be led away from their land into exile.'\u201d ", "12": "Amatzyah also said to 'Amos, \u201cGo away, seer! Go back to the land of Y'hudah! Earn your living there; and prophesy there; ", "13": "but don't prophesy any more at Beit-El; for this is the king's sanctuary, a royal temple.\u201d", "14": "'Amos gave this answer to Amatzyah: \u201cI am not trained as a prophet, and I'm not one of the guild prophets \u2014 I own sheep and grow figs.

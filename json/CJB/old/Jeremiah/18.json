", "4": "Whenever a pot he made came out imperfect, the potter took the clay and made another pot with it, in whatever shape suited him.", "5": "Then the word of Adonai came to me: ", "6": "\u201cHouse of Isra'el, can't I deal with you as the potter deals with his clay? \u2014 says Adonai. Look! You, house of Isra'el, are the same in my hand as the clay in the potter's hand.

", "9": "Similarly, at another time, I may speak about building and planting a nation or kingdom; ", "10": "but if it behaves wickedly from my perspective and doesn't listen to what I say, then I change my mind and don't do the good I said I would do that would have helped it.", "11": "\u201cSo now, tell the people of Y'hudah and those living in Yerushalayim that this is what Adonai says: 'I am designing disaster for you, working out my plan against you. Turn, each of you, from his evil ways; improve your conduct and actions.'", "12": "\u201cBut they will answer, 'It's hopeless! We will stick to our own plans; each of us will stubbornly follow his own evil desires!'", "13": "\u201cTherefore, Adonai says this: 'Ask among the nations who has heard anything like this.

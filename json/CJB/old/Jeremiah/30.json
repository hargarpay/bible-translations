'I will cause them to return to the land I gave their ancestors, and they will take possession of it.'\u201d", "4": "These are the words Adonai spoke concerning Isra'el and Y'hudah: ", "5": "Here is what Adonai says: \u201cWe have heard a cry of terror, of fear and not of peace.", "6": "Ask now and see: can men give birth to children? Why, then, do I see all the men with their hands on their stomachs like women in labor, with every face turned pale?", "7": "How dreadful that day will be! \u2014 there has never been one like it: a time of trouble for Ya'akov, but out of it he will be saved.", "8": "\u201cOn that day,\u201d says Adonai-Tzva'ot, \u201cI will break his yoke from off your neck, I will snap your chains.

", "3": "Here is what Adonai-Tzva'ot, the God of Isra'el, says: \u201cImprove your ways and actions, and I will let you stay in this place. ", "4": "Don't rely on that deceitful slogan, 'The temple of Adonai, the temple of Adonai \u2014 these [buildings] are the temple of Adonai.' ", "5": "No, but if you really improve your ways and actions; if you really administer justice between people; ", "6": "if you stop oppressing foreigners, orphans and widows; if you stop shedding innocent blood in this place; and if you stop following other gods, to your own harm; ", "7": "then I will let you stay in this place, in the land I gave to your ancestors forever and ever. ", "8": "Look! You are relying on deceitful words that can't do you any good. ", "9": "First you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, offer to Ba'al and go after other gods that you haven't known.

Now,\u201d says Adonai, \u201cbecause you have done all these things, ", "14": "I will do to the house that bears my name, on which you rely, and to the place I gave you and your ancestors, what I did to Shiloh; ", "15": "and I will drive you out of my presence, just as I drove out all your kinsmen, all the descendants of Efrayim.\u201d'", "16": "\u201cSo you, [Yirmeyahu,] don't pray for this people!

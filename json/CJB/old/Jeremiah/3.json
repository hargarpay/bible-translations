But you prostituted yourself to many lovers, yet you want to return to me?\u201d says Adonai.", "2": "\u201cRaise your eyes to the bare hills, take a look: where have you not had sex? You sat by the roadsides waiting for them like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.", "3": "For this reason the showers have been withheld, there has been no rain in the spring; still you maintain a whore's brazen look and refuse to be ashamed.", "4": "Didn't you just now cry to me, 'My father, you are my friend from my youth'? \u2014", "5": "[thinking,] 'He won't bear a grudge forever, will he? He wouldn't maintain it right to the end.' You say this, but you keep doing evil things, you just do whatever you want.\u201d", "6": "In the days of Yoshiyahu the king, Adonai asked me, \u201cHave you seen the things that backsliding Isra'el has been doing? She goes up on every bare hill and under every green tree and prostitutes herself there. ", "7": "I said that after she had done all these things, she would return to me; but she hasn't returned. Meanwhile, her unfaithful sister Y'hudah has been watching. ", "8": "I saw that even though backsliding Isra'el had committed adultery, so that I had sent her away and given her a divorce document, unfaithful Y'hudah her sister was not moved to fear \u2014 instead she too went and prostituted herself. ", "9": "The ease with which Isra'el prostituted herself defiled the land, as she committed adultery with stones and with logs. ", "10": "Yet in spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Y'hudah has not returned to me wholeheartedly; she only makes a pretense of it,\u201d said Adonai.", "11": "Then Adonai said to me, \u201cBacksliding Isra'el has proved herself more righteous than unfaithful Y'hudah.

Hoist a banner, proclaim it, don't hide it! Say: 'Bavel is captured. Bel is shamed, M'rodakh disgraced, her images shamed, her idols disgraced.'", "3": "For from the north a nation is marching against her that will desolate her land. No one will live there \u2014 both humans and animals have fled and gone.", "4": "In those days, at that time,\u201d says Adonai, \u201cthe people of Isra'el will come, together with the people of Y'hudah. They will weep as they go their way, seeking Adonai their God.", "5": "They will ask the way to Tziyon; and, turning their faces toward it, will say, 'Come, join yourselves to Adonai by an everlasting covenant never to be forgotten.'", "6": "My people have been lost sheep. My shepherds made them go astray, turning them loose in the mountains. As they wandered from mountain to hill, they lost track of where their home is.", "7": "Everyone finding them ate them up.

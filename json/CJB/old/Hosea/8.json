{"1": "\u201cPut the shofar to your lips! Like a vulture [he swoops down] on the house of Adonai, because they have violated my covenant and sinned intentionally against my Torah.", "2": "Will they cry out to me, 'We are Isra'el, God, we know you'?", "3": "Isra'el has thrown away what is good; the enemy will pursue him.", "4": "They make kings, but without my authority; they appoint leaders, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they make themselves idols, but these can lead only to their own destruction.", "5": "Your calf, Shomron, has been thrown away; my fury burns against them. How long will it be until they are able to make themselves clean?", "6": "Here is what Isra'el produces: a craftsman makes something \u2014 it's a non-god; the calf of Shomron will be broken to pieces.", "7": "For they sow the wind, so they will reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no ears, so it will yield no flour; and if it does yield any, foreigners will swallow it up.", "8": "Isra'el is swallowed up; now they are among the Goyim like a vessel nobody wants.", "9": "For they have gone up to Ashur; like a wild donkey, alone by itself, Efrayim has bargained for lovers.", "10": "But even if they bargain among the Goyim, now I will round them up.

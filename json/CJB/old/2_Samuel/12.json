{"1": "Adonai sent Natan to David. He came and said to him, \u201cIn a certain city there were two men, one rich, the other poor. ", "2": "The rich man had vast flocks and herds; ", "3": "but the poor man had nothing, except for one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared. It had grown up with him and his children; it ate from his plate, drank from his cup, lay on his chest \u2014 it was like a daughter to him. ", "4": "One day a traveler visited the rich man, and instead of picking an animal from his own flock or herd to cook for his visitor, he took the poor man's lamb and cooked it for the man who had come to him.\u201d", "5": "David exploded with anger against the man and said to Natan, \u201cAs Adonai lives, the man who did this deserves to die! ", "6": "For doing such a thing, he has to pay back four times the value of the lamb \u2014 and also because he had no pity.\u201d", "7": "Natan said to David, \u201cYou are the man. \u201cHere is what Adonai, the God of Isra'el says: 'I anointed you king over Isra'el. I rescued you from the power of Sha'ul. ", "8": "I gave you your master's house and your master's wives to embrace. I gave you the house of Isra'el and the house of Y'hudah. And if that had been too little, I would have added to you a lot more.", "9": "\u201c'So why have you shown such contempt for the word of Adonai and done what I see as evil? You murdered Uriyah the Hitti with the sword and taken his wife as your own wife; you put him to death with the sword of the people of 'Amon. ", "10": "Now therefore, the sword will never leave your house \u2014 because you have shown contempt for me and taken the wife of Uriyah the Hitti as your own wife.' ", "11": "Here is what Adonai says: 'I will generate evil against you out of your own household. I will take your wives before your very eyes and give them to your neighbor; he will go to bed with your wives, and everyone will know about it. ", "12": "For you did it secretly, but I will do this before all Isra'el in broad daylight.'\u201d", "13": "David said to Natan, \u201cI have sinned against Adonai.\u201d Natan said to David, \u201cAdonai also has taken away your sin. You will not die. ", "14": "However, because by this act you have so greatly blasphemed Adonai, the child born to you must die.\u201d ", "15": "Then Natan returned to his house. Adonai struck the child that Uriyah's wife had borne to David, and it became very ill. ", "16": "David prayed to God on behalf of the child; David fasted, then came and lay all night on the ground. ", "17": "The court officials got up and stood next to him trying to get him off the ground, but he refused, and he wouldn't eat food with them. ", "18": "On the seventh day, the child died. The servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, because they said, \u201cWhile the child was still alive, we spoke to him, and he didn't listen to us; if we tell him now that the child is dead, he may do himself some harm.\u201d ", "19": "But when David saw his servants whispering to each other, he suspected that the child was dead. David asked his servants, \u201cIs the child dead?\u201d and they answered, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d", "20": "Then David got up off the ground, washed, anointed himself and changed his clothes. He went into the house of Adonai and worshipped; then he went to his own palace; and when he asked for food, they served it to him; and he ate. ", "21": "His servants asked him, \u201cWhat are you doing? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat food!\u201d ", "22": "He answered, \u201cWhile the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; because I thought, 'Maybe Adonai will show his grace to me and let the child live.' ", "23": "But now that he's dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.\u201d", "24": "David comforted his wife Bat-Sheva, came to her and went to bed with her; she gave birth to a son and named him Shlomo. Adonai loved him ", "25": "and sent through Natan the prophet to have him named Y'didyah [loved by God], for Adonai's sake.", "26": "Yo'av fought against Rabbah of the people of 'Amon and took the royal city. ", "27": "Yo'av sent people to David with this message: \u201cI have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply. ", "28": "Therefore, assemble the rest of the people; lay siege to the city; and capture it. Otherwise, I will capture the city; and it will be named after me!\u201d ", "29": "David assembled all the people, went to Rabbah, fought against it and captured it. ", "30": "He took the crown off Malkam's head; it weighed sixty-six pounds, with its gold and precious stones; and it was placed on David's head. He carried off great quantities of spoil from the city. ", "31": "In addition, he expelled the people who were in it and set them to work with saws, iron harrows and iron axes, or had them cross over to work in the brick factory. This is what he did to all the cities of the people of 'Amon. Then David and all the people returned to Yerushalayim."}

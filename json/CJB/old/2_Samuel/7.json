", "6": "Since the day I brought the people of Isra'el out of Egypt until today, I never lived in a house; rather, I traveled in a tent and a tabernacle. ", "7": "Everywhere I traveled with all the people of Isra'el, did I ever speak a word to any of the tribes of Isra'el, whom I ordered to shepherd my people Isra'el, asking, \u201cWhy haven't you built me a cedar-wood house?\u201d'", "8": "\u201cTherefore say this to my servant David that this is what Adonai-Tzva'ot says: 'I took you from the sheep-yards, from following the sheep, to make you chief over my people, over Isra'el.

The wicked will no longer oppress them, as they did at the beginning, ", "11": "and as they did from the time I ordered judges to be over my people Isra'el; instead, I will give you rest from all your enemies. \u201c'Moreover, Adonai tells you that Adonai will make you a house.

", "19": "Yet in your view, Adonai Elohim, even this was too small a thing; so you have even said that your servant's dynasty will continue on into the distant future. This is [indeed] a teaching for a man, Adonai Elohim \u2014 ", "20": "what more can David say to you? For you know your servant intimately, Adonai Elohim.

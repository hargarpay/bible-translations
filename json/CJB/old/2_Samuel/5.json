{"1": "Then all the tribes of Isra'el came to David in Hevron and said, \u201cHere, we are your own flesh and bone. ", "2": "In the past, when Sha'ul was king over us, it was you who led Isra'el's military campaigns; and Adonai said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Isra'el, and you will be chief over Isra'el.'\u201d ", "3": "So all the leaders of Isra'el came to the king in Hevron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hevron in the presence of Adonai. Then they anointed David king over Isra'el. ", "4": "David was thirty years old when he began his rule, and he ruled forty years. ", "5": "In Hevron he ruled over Y'hudah seven years and six months; then in Yerushalayim he ruled thirty-three years over all Isra'el and Y'hudah.", "6": "The king and his men went to Yerushalayim to attack the Y'vusi, the inhabitants of that region. They taunted David, \u201cYou won't get in here! Even the blind and the lame could fend you off!\u201d \u2014 in other words, they were thinking, \u201cDavid will never get in here.\u201d ", "7": "Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Tziyon, also known [now] as the City of David. ", "8": "What David said on that day was, \u201cIn order to attack the Y'vusi, you have to climb up [from the spring outside the city] through the water tunnel. Then you can do away with those [so-called] 'lame and blind'\u201d (whom David despises \u2014 hence the expression, \u201cThe 'blind and lame' keep him from entering the house\u201d).", "9": "David lived in the stronghold and called it the City of David. Then David built up the city around it, starting at the Millo [earth rampart] and working inward. ", "10": "David grew greater and greater, because Adonai the God of Armies was with him. ", "11": "Hiram king of Tzor sent envoys to David with cedar logs, and with them were carpenters and stonemasons; and they built David a palace. ", "12": "David then knew that Adonai had set him up as king over Isra'el and increased his royal power for the sake of his people.", "13": "David took for himself more concubines and wives in Yerushalayim after coming from Hevron, so that still more sons and daughters were born to David. ", "14": "Here are the names of those born to him in Yerushalayim: Shamua, Shovav, Natan, Shlomo, ", "15": "Yivchar, Elishua, Nefeg, Yafia, ", "16": "Elishama, Elyada and Elifelet.", "17": "When the P'lishtim heard that David had been anointed king over Isra'el, all the P'lishtim went up in search of David. On learning of it, David went down to the stronghold. ", "18": "The P'lishtim came and deployed in the Refa'im Valley. ", "19": "David consulted Adonai, asking, \u201cShould I attack the P'lishtim? Will you hand them over to me?\u201d Adonai answered David, \u201cAttack; I will certainly hand the P'lishtim over to you.\u201d ", "20": "So David went to Ba'al-P'ratzim and defeated them there. He said, \u201cAdonai has broken through my enemies for me like a river breaking through its banks.\u201d This is why he called the place Ba'al-P'ratzim [Lord of breaking through]. ", "21": "The P'lishtim had left their idols there, so David and his men took them away.", "22": "The P'lishtim came up again and deployed in the Refa'im Valley. ", "23": "When David consulted Adonai, he said, \u201cDon't attack! Circle behind them, and engage them opposite the balsam trees. ", "24": "When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, advance; because then Adonai has gone out ahead of you to defeat the army of the P'lishtim.\u201d ", "25": "David did exactly as Adonai had ordered him to do and pursued his attack on the P'lishtim from Geva all the way to Gezer."}

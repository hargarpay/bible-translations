{"1": "David took a census of the people who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and of hundreds. ", "2": "Then David dispatched the people, a third of them under the command of Yo'av, a third under Avishai the son of Tz'ruyah, Yo'av's brother, and a third under Ittai the Gitti; and the king said to the people, \u201cI will also go out with you, myself.\u201d ", "3": "But the people replied, \u201cDon't go out; because if we flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; so it is better now that you stay in the city and be ready if we need help.\u201d ", "4": "The king answered them, \u201cI will do whatever you think best.\u201d So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. ", "5": "The king gave orders to Yo'av, Avishai and Ittai, \u201cFor my sake, deal gently with young Avshalom.\u201d All the people were listening when the king gave all the commanders this order concerning Avshalom.", "6": "So the people went out into the field against Isra'el; the battle took place in the forest of Efrayim. ", "7": "The people of Isra'el were defeated there by David's servants; there was a terrible slaughter that day of 20,000 men. ", "8": "For the battle there was spread all over the countryside; the forest devoured more people that day than did the sword.", "9": "Avshalom happened to meet some of David's servants. Avshalom was riding his mule, and as the mule walked under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree, his head got caught in the terebinth, so that he was left hanging between earth and sky, as the mule went on from under him. ", "10": "Someone saw it and told Yo'av, \u201cI saw Avshalom hanging in a terebinth.\u201d ", "11": "Yo'av asked the man who told him, \u201cHere now, you saw it; so why didn't you strike him to the ground then and there? I would have had to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt besides.\u201d ", "12": "The man replied to Yo'av, \u201cEven if I were to get a thousand pieces of silver, I still wouldn't raise my hand against the son of the king! After all, while we were listening, the king ordered you, Avishai and Ittai, 'Be careful that no one touches young Avshalom.' ", "13": "Or, if I had pretended that I didn't know, the king would have known otherwise anyway; and you wouldn't have interceded for me either.\u201d ", "14": "Yo'av said, \u201cI can't waste time arguing with you!\u201d He took three darts in his hand and rammed them through Avshalom's heart while he was still alive, hanging from the terebinth. ", "15": "Then Yo'av's ten young armor-bearers surrounded Avshalom, struck him and killed him.", "16": "Yo'av sounded the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing Isra'el, because Yo'av held back the troops. ", "17": "They took Avshalom and threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled a big heap of stones over him. All Isra'el fled, each one to his tent. ", "18": "In his own lifetime Avshalom had taken and raised for himself the pillar which stands in the King's Valley; because he said, \u201cI don't have a son to preserve the memory of my name.\u201d So he named the pillar after himself, and it's called Avshalom's Monument to this day.", "19": "Then Achima'atz the son of Tzadok said, \u201cLet me run now and bring news to the king that Adonai has judged in his favor by releasing him from his enemies.\u201d ", "20": "Yo'av said to him, \u201cYou are not to be the one to bring the news today; you can convey news another day; but today you will not bring news, because the king's son is dead.\u201d ", "21": "Then Yo'av said to the Ethiopian, \u201cGo, tell the king what you saw.\u201d The Ethiopian bowed to Yo'av, then ran off. ", "22": "But Achima'atz the son of Tzadok said again to Yo'av, \u201cCome what may, please let me also run after the Ethiopian.\u201d Yo'av answered, \u201cWhy do you want to run, my son? You won't receive any reward for bringing the news.\u201d ", "23": "\u201cI don't care \u2014 whatever happens, I want to run.\u201d So he said to him, \u201cRun.\u201d Then Achima'atz ran by the road through the desert flats and outran the Ethiopian.", "24": "David was sitting between the two gates. A watchman went up to the roof of the gate and out onto the wall, raised his eyes, looked, and saw there a man running by himself. ", "25": "The watchman cried out and told the king. The king said, \u201cIf he's alone, he has good news to tell.\u201d As he ran along and came close, ", "26": "the watchman saw another man running and called to the gatekeeper, \u201cThere's another man running by himself.\u201d The king said, \u201cHe too must have good news.\u201d ", "27": "The watchman said, \u201cThe first one runs like Achima'atz the son of Tzadok.\u201d The king said, \u201cHe's a good man, he comes with good news.\u201d", "28": "Achima'atz called to the king, \u201cShalom,\u201d prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground and said, \u201cBlessed be Adonai your God, who has handed over the men who rebelled against my lord the king.\u201d ", "29": "The king asked, \u201cIs everything all right with young Avshalom?\u201d Achima'atz answered, \u201cWhen Yo'av sent the king's servant and me your servant, I saw a big commotion; but I didn't know what it was.\u201d ", "30": "The king said, \u201cGo, and stand over there.\u201d So he went and stood there. ", "31": "Then up came the Ethiopian, and the Ethiopian said, \u201cThere's good news for my lord the king, for Adonai has judged in your favor and rid you of all those who rebelled against you.\u201d ", "32": "The king asked the Ethiopian, \u201cIs everything all right with young Avshalom?\u201d The Ethiopian answered, \u201cMay the enemies of my lord the king and all who rebel against you in order to harm you be as that young man is.\u201d"}

", "3": "To the L'vi'im who were teaching all Isra'el and were holy for Adonai he said, \u201cPut the holy ark in the house which Shlomo the son of David, king of Isra'el, built; after this, you will not have to carry it again. Now serve Adonai your God and his people Isra'el. ", "4": "Organize yourselves by clans and duty divisions according to the arrangement written down by David king of Isra'el and Shlomo his son. ", "5": "Stand in the Holy Place according to the divisions of the clans of your kinsmen the ordinary people, with part of a clan of L'vi'im serving each clan [of Isra'el].

", "12": "They removed the portions to be burned, in order to give them to the divisions of the clans of the ordinary people to present to Adonai, as written in the scroll of Moshe. They did the same with the oxen. ", "13": "They roasted the Pesach lamb over fire, according to the rule; while they boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles and pans and carried them quickly to all the ordinary people. ", "14": "Afterwards, they prepared food for themselves and for the cohanim; because the cohanim, the descendants of Aharon, were busy till nightfall offering the fat and the portions to be burned up; this is why the L'vi'im prepared food both for themselves and for the cohanim the descendants of Aharon.", "15": "The singers the sons of Asaf were at their posts, as ordered by David \u2014 Asaf, Heman and Y'dutun the king's seer.

", "19": "This Pesach was observed in the eighteenth year of Yoshiyahu.", "20": "After all this, and after Yoshiyahu had restored the house, N'kho king of Egypt went up to attack Kark'mish by the Euphrates River. King Yoshiyahu went out to oppose him; ", "21": "but N'kho sent envoys to him with this message: \u201cDo I have a conflict with you, king of Y'hudah? No, I am not coming today to attack you, but to attack the dynasty with whom I am at war. God has ordered to speed me along; so don't meddle with God, who is with me; so that he won't destroy you.\u201d ", "22": "Nevertheless, Yoshiyahu was determined to go after him. He disguised himself in order to fight against him and wouldn't listen to what N'kho said, which was from the mouth of God. Then he went to fight in the Megiddo Valley. ", "23": "There archers shot King Yoshiyahu. The king said to his servants, \u201cTake me away, because I'm badly wounded.\u201d ", "24": "So his servants took him out of the chariot, transferred him to his second chariot and brought him to Yerushalayim. But he died, and he was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Y'hudah and Yerushalayim mourned Yoshiyahu. ", "25": "Yirmeyahu composed a lament for Yoshiyahu; and all the men and women singers have sung of Yoshiyahu in their laments till this day. They made singing them a law in Isra'el, and they are recorded in the Laments.", "26": "Other activities of Yoshiyahu and all his good deeds in keeping with what is written in the Torah of Adonai, ", "27": "also his accomplishments from beginning to end, are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra'el and Y'hudah."}

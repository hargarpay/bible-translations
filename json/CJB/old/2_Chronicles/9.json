When she appeared before Shlomo, she spoke with him about everything on her heart; ", "2": "and Shlomo answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king that he could not explain to her. ", "3": "After the queen of Sh'va had seen Shlomo's wisdom, the palace he had built, ", "4": "the food at his table, the manner of seating his officials, the manner in which his staff served him and how they were dressed, his personal servants and how they were dressed, and his manner of going up to the house of Adonai, it left her breathless. ", "5": "She said to the king, \u201cWhat I heard in my own country about your deeds and your wisdom is true, ", "6": "but I couldn't believe the report until I came and saw for myself. Actually, they didn't tell me even half of how great your wisdom is. In reality, you surpass the reports I heard. ", "7": "How happy your people must be, how happy these servants of yours who are always here attending you and get to hear your wisdom! ", "8": "Blessed be Adonai your God, who took pleasure in you to put you on his throne, so that you could be king for Adonai your God. Because of your God's love for Isra'el, to establish them forever, he has made you king over them, to administer law and judgment.\u201d ", "9": "Then she gave the king four tons of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there had never been spices like those the queen of Sh'va gave to King Shlomo.", "10": "Huram's servants and Shlomo's servants, who had brought the gold from Ofir, now brought sandalwood and precious stones. ", "11": "The king used the sandalwood to make walkways for the house of Adonai and for the royal palace, also lyres and lutes for the singers. None like these had been seen before in the land of Y'hudah.", "12": "King Shlomo gave the queen of Sh'va everything she wanted, whatever she asked, more than what she had brought to the king. After this, she returned and went back to her own country, she and her servants.", "13": "The weight of the gold Shlomo received annually came to twenty-two tons, ", "14": "besides that which came from customs duties and sales taxes; also all the Arab kings and regional governors brought gold and silver to Shlomo.

", "16": "He made 300 more shields of hammered gold, with seven-and-a-half pounds going into one shield; the king put these in the House of the L'vanon Forest.", "17": "The king also made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. ", "18": "The throne had six steps and a gold footstool; these were fastened to the throne. There were arms on either side of the seat, two lions standing beside the arms, ", "19": "and twelve more lions standing on each side of the six steps. Nothing like it had ever been made in any kingdom.", "20": "All King Shlomo's drinking vessels were of gold; and all the utensils in the House of the L'vanon Forest were of pure gold; for in Shlomo's time, silver was regarded as having little value.

", "28": "They brought horses for Shlomo from Egypt and from all countries.", "29": "Other activities of Shlomo, from beginning to end, are written in the records of Natan the prophet, in the prophecy of Achiyah of Shiloh and in the visions of Ye'do the seer concerning Yarov'am the son of N'vat.

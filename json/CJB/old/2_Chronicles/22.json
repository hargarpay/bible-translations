{"1": "The people living in Yerushalayim made Achazyah his youngest son king in place of him, since the raiding party that had invaded the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older ones. So Achazyah the son of Y'horam king of Y'hudah reigned. ", "2": "Achazyah was forty-two years old when he began his reign, and he ruled for one year in Yerushalayim. His mother's name was 'Atalyahu the daughter of 'Omri. ", "3": "He too lived after the example of the house of Ach'av, because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly. ", "4": "So he did what was evil from Adonai's perspective, as had the house of Ach'av; because, to his destruction, they were his counselors after his father died; ", "5": "and he lived his life by their advice. With Y'horam the son of Ach'av, king of Isra'el, he went to war against Haza'el king of Aram at Ramot-Gil'ad, where the Aramim wounded Yoram. ", "6": "He returned to Yizre'el to be healed of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah while fighting Haza'el king of Aram. Achazyah the son of Y'horam, king of Y'hudah, went down to visit Y'horam the son of Ach'av in Yizre'el, because he was not feeling well.", "7": "Through Achazyah's visit to Yoram, God brought about his downfall. After he arrived, he accompanied Yoram against Yehu the son of Nimshi, whom Adonai had anointed to cut off the house of Ach'av.

But [his subjects] buried him, because they said, \u201cHe was the [grand]son of Y'hoshafat, who sought Adonai with all his heart.\u201d At this point there was no one in the house of Achazyah strong enough to rule the kingdom.

", "11": "But Y'hoshav'at the daughter of the king took Yo'ash the son of Achazyah, stole him away from among the princes who were being slaughtered, and sequestered him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus Y'hoshav'at the daughter of King Y'horam, wife of Y'hoyada the cohen and sister of Achazyah, hid him from 'Atalyah, so that he was not killed. ", "12": "He remained hidden with them in the house of God for six years; during this time 'Atalyah ruled the land."}

", "2": "He did what was evil from Adonai's perspective, following the disgusting practices of the nations whom Adonai had expelled ahead of the people of Isra'el. ", "3": "For he rebuilt the high places which Hizkiyahu his father had smashed; he erected altars for the ba'alim, made sacred poles and worshipped all the army of heaven and served them. ", "4": "He erected altars in the house of Adonai, concerning which Adonai had said, \u201cMy name will be in Yerushalayim forever.\u201d ", "5": "He erected altars for all the army of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Adonai. ", "6": "He made his children pass through the fire [as a sacrifice] in the Ben-Hinnom Valley. He practiced soothsaying, divination and sorcery; and he appointed mediums and persons who used spirit guides. He did much that was evil from Adonai's perspective, thus provoking him to anger. ", "7": "He set the carved image of the idol he had made in the house of God, concerning which God had told David and Shlomo his son, \u201cIn this house and in Yerushalayim, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Isra'el, I will put my name forever.

", "12": "Then, when he was in distress, he began to appease the anger of Adonai, abjectly humbling himself before the God of his ancestors. ", "13": "He prayed to him; and God was moved by his plea, paid attention to his entreaty and brought him back to Yerushalayim, to his kingly office. Then M'nasheh understood that Adonai really is God.", "14": "After this he built an outer wall for the City of David on the west side of Gichon, in the valley, extending as far as the entrance at the Fish Gate; it encompassed the 'Ofel, and he built it very high. He stationed army commanders in all the fortified cities of Y'hudah.

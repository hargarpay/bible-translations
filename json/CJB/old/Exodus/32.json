{"1": "When the people saw that Moshe was taking a long time to come down from the mountain, they gathered around Aharon and said to him, \u201cGet busy; and make us gods to go ahead of us; because this Moshe, the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt \u2014 we don't know what has become of him.\u201d ", "2": "Aharon said to them, \u201cHave your wives, sons and daughters strip off their gold earrings; and bring them to me.\u201d ", "3": "The people stripped off their gold earrings and brought them to Aharon. ", "4": "He received what they gave him, melted it down, and made it into the shape of a calf. They said, \u201cIsra'el! Here is your god, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!\u201d ", "5": "On seeing this, Aharon built an altar in front of it and proclaimed, \u201cTomorrow is to be a feast for Adonai.\u201d ", "6": "Early the next morning they got up and offered burnt offerings and presented peace offerings. Afterwards, the people sat down to eat and drink; then they got up to indulge in revelry.", "7": "Adonai said to Moshe, \u201cGo down! Hurry! Your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have become corrupt! ", "8": "So quickly they have turned aside from the way I ordered them to follow! They have cast a metal statue of a calf, worshipped it, sacrificed to it and said, 'Isra'el! Here is your god, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!'\u201d ", "9": "Adonai continued speaking to Moshe: \u201cI have been watching these people; and you can see how stiffnecked they are. ", "10": "Now leave me alone, so that my anger can blaze against them, and I can put an end to them! I will make a great nation out of you instead.\u201d", "11": "Moshe pleaded with Adonai his God. He said, \u201cAdonai, why must your anger blaze against your own people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand? ", "12": "Why let the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intentions that he led them out, to slaughter them in the hills and wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger! Relent! Don't bring such disaster on your people! ", "13": "Remember Avraham, Yitz'chak and Isra'el, your servants, to whom you swore by your very self. You promised them, 'I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky; and I will give all this land I have spoken about to your descendants; and they will possess it forever.'\u201d ", "14": "Adonai then changed his mind about the disaster he had planned for his people.", "15": "Moshe turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets inscribed on both sides, on the front and on the back. ", "16": "The tablets were the work of God; and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. ", "17": "When Y'hoshua heard the noise of the people shouting he said to Moshe, \u201cIt sounds like war in the camp!\u201d ", "18": "He answered, \u201cThat is neither the clamor of victory nor the wailings of defeat; what I hear is the sound of people singing.\u201d", "19": "But the moment Moshe got near the camp, when he saw the calf and the dancing, his own anger blazed up. He threw down the tablets he had been holding and shattered them at the base of the mountain. ", "20": "Seizing the calf they had made, he melted it in the fire and ground it to powder, which he scattered on the water. Then he made the people of Isra'el drink it.", "21": "Moshe said to Aharon, \u201cWhat did these people do to you to make you lead them into such a terrible sin?\u201d ", "22": "Aharon replied, \u201cMy lord shouldn't be so angry. You know what these people are like, that they are determined to do evil. ", "23": "So they said to me, 'Make us gods to go ahead of us; because this Moshe, the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt \u2014 we don't know what has become of him.' ", "24": "I answered them, 'Anyone with gold, strip it off!' So they gave it to me. I threw it in the fire, and out came this calf!\u201d", "25": "When Moshe saw that the people had gotten out of control \u2014 because Aharon had allowed them to get out of control, to the derision of their enemies \u2014 ", "26": "Moshe stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, \u201cWhoever is for Adonai, come to me!\u201d All the descendants of Levi rallied around him. ", "27": "He told them, \u201cHere is what Adonai, the God of Isra'el, says: 'Each of you, put his sword on his side; and go up and down the camp, from gate to gate; and every man is to kill his own kinsman, his own friend and his own neighbor!\u201d ", "28": "The sons of Levi did what Moshe said, and that day three thousand of the people died. ", "29": "Moshe said, \u201cYou have consecrated yourselves today to Adonai, because every one of you has been against his own son and against his own kinsman, in order to bring a blessing on yourselves today.\u201d", "30": "The next day Moshe said to the people, \u201cYou have committed a terrible sin. Now I will go up to Adonai ; maybe I will be able to atone for your sin.\u201d ", "31": "Moshe went back to Adonai and said, \u201cPlease! These people have committed a terrible sin: they have made themselves a god out of gold. ", "32": "Now, if you will just forgive their sin! But if you won't, then, I beg you, blot me out of your book which you have written!\u201d ", "33": "Adonai answered Moshe, \u201cThose who have sinned against me are the ones I will blot out of my book. ", "34": "Now go and lead the people to the place I told you about; my angel will go ahead of you. Nevertheless, the time for punishment will come; and then I will punish them for their sin.\u201d ", "35": "Adonai struck the people with a plague because they had made the calf, the one Aharon made."}

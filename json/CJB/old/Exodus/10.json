Let my people go, so that they can worship me. ", "4": "Otherwise, if you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. ", "5": "One won't be able to see the ground, so completely will the locusts cover it. They will eat anything you still have that escaped the hail, including every tree you have growing in the field.

", "2": "Y'hoshua said to all the people, \u201cThis is what Adonai the God of Isra'el says: 'In antiquity your ancestors lived on the other side of the [Euphrates] River \u2014 Terach the father of Avraham and Nachor \u2014 and they served other gods. ", "3": "I took your ancestor Avraham from beyond the River, led him through all the land of Kena'an, increased his descendants and gave him Yitz'chak. ", "4": "I gave to Yitz'chak Ya'akov and 'Esav. To 'Esav I gave Mount Se'ir as his possession, but Ya'akov and his children went down into Egypt. ", "5": "I sent Moshe and Aharon, I inflicted plagues on Egypt in accordance with what I did among them, and afterwards I brought you out. ", "6": "Yes, I brought your fathers out of Egypt: you arrived at the sea, and the Egyptians were pursuing your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Sea of Suf. ", "7": "But when they cried out to Adonai, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, overwhelmed them with the sea and drowned them. Your eyes saw what I did in Egypt, and then you lived in the desert for a long time. ", "8": "I brought you into the land of the Emori living beyond the Yarden; they fought against you, but I handed them over to you. You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them ahead of you. ", "9": "Then Balak the son of Tzippor, king of Mo'av, rose up and fought against Isra'el. He sent and summoned Bil'am the son of B'or to put a curse on you. ", "10": "But I refused to listen to Bil'am, and he actually blessed you. In this way I rescued you from him.

The men of Yericho fought against you \u2014 the Emori, P'rizi, Kena'ani, Hitti, Girgashi, Hivi and Y'vusi \u2014 and I handed them over to you.

You eat fruit from vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.'", "14": "\u201cTherefore fear Adonai, and serve him truly and sincerely. Put away the gods your ancestors served beyond the [Euphrates]River and in Egypt, and serve Adonai! ", "15": "If it seems bad to you to serve Adonai, then choose today whom you are going to serve! Will it be the gods your ancestors served beyond the River? or the gods of the Emori, in whose land you are living? As for me and my household, we will serve Adonai!\u201d", "16": "The people answered, \u201cFar be it from us that we would abandon Adonai to serve other gods; ", "17": "because it is Adonai our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from a life of slavery, and did those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us all along the way we traveled and among all the peoples we passed through; ", "18": "and it was Adonai who drove out from ahead of us all the peoples, the Emori living in the land. Therefore we too will serve Adonai, for he is our God.\u201d", "19": "Y'hoshua said to the people, \u201cYou can't serve Adonai; because he is a holy God, a jealous God, and he will not forgive your crimes and sins.

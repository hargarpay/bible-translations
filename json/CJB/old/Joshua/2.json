", "2": "The king of Yericho was told about it \u2014 \u201cTonight some men from Isra'el came here to reconnoiter the land.\u201d", "3": "The king of Yericho sent a message to Rachav, \u201cBring out the men who came to you and are staying in your house, because they have come to reconnoiter all the land.\u201d ", "4": "However, the woman, after taking the two men and hiding them, replied, \u201cYes, the men did come to me; but I didn't know where they had come from.

The end is coming to the four corners of the land!", "3": "Now the end is upon you! I will send my anger upon you, I will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your disgusting practices.", "4": "My eye will not spare you, I will have no pity, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your disgusting practices will be done among you.

", "3": "Adonai Elohim says: \u201cWoe to the vile prophets who follow their own spirits and things which they have not seen! ", "4": "Isra'el, your prophets have been like jackals among ruins. ", "5": "You [prophets] have not gone up to the breaks in the barricade or repaired it for the house of Isra'el, so that they can stand fast in battle on the day of Adonai. ", "6": "Their visions are futile and their divination is false; they say, 'Adonai says,' when Adonai has not sent them; yet they hope that the word will be confirmed. ", "7": "Haven't you had a futile vision and spoken a false divination when you say, 'Adonai says,' and I have not spoken? ", "8": "Therefore here is what Adonai Elohim does say: 'Because you have spoken futilities and seen falsehoods, therefore I am against you,' says Adonai Elohim.", "9": "\u201c'\u201cMy hand will be against the prophets who have futile visions and produce false divinations; they will not be allowed into the council of my people, or be written in the register of the house of Isra'el, or enter the land of Isra'el. Then you will know that I am Adonai Elohim. ", "10": "They deserve this, because they have led my people astray by saying there is peace when there is no peace.

", "14": "This is how I will break down the wall you covered with whitewash \u2014 I will smash it to the ground, so that its foundation will be revealed. The wall will fall down, and you will be consumed with it. Then you will know that I am Adonai. ", "15": "In this way I will spend my fury on the wall and on those who covered it with whitewash; and I will say to you, 'The wall is gone, and so are those who \u201cplastered\u201d it,' ", "16": "that is, the prophets of Isra'el who prophesy about Yerushalayim and see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,\u201d says Adonai Elohim.'", "17": "\u201cYou, human being, turn your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own thoughts.

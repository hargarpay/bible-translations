{"1": "On the fifth day of the sixth month of the sixth year, as I was sitting in my house, and the leaders of Y'hudah were sitting there with me, the hand of Adonai Elohim fell on me. ", "2": "I looked and saw what seemed like a man made of fire. From what appeared to be his waist downward was fire, and from his waist upward was what appeared to be a gleaming amber-colored brilliance. ", "3": "The form of a hand was put out, which took me by a lock of my hair; and a spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me, in these visions from God, to Yerushalayim, to the entrance of the inner [courtyard] gate that faces north. There stood the idol that [arouses God's] jealousy and provokes [his] zealous indignation. ", "4": "There before me was the glory of the God of Isra'el, as in the vision I had seen in the valley.", "5": "Then he said to me, \u201cHuman being, raise your eyes toward the north.\u201d I raised my eyes toward the north and saw, north of the Altar Gate, this image that [arouses God's] jealousy in the entryway. ", "6": "He asked me, \u201cHuman being, do you see what they are doing, the horribly disgusting practices that the house of Isra'el is committing here, so that I must distance myself from my own sanctuary? But you will see even worse abominations.\u201d", "7": "He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard; and when I looked, I saw a hole in the wall. ", "8": "He said to me, \u201cHuman being, dig into the wall.\u201d After digging in the wall, I saw a door. ", "9": "\u201cGo in,\u201d he said, \u201cand see the wicked practices they are engaged in here.\u201d ", "10": "So I went in and looked, and there, carved on the walls all around, were every kind of reptile and repulsive animal, along with all the idols of the house of Isra'el. ", "11": "Standing in front of them were seventy of the leading men of the house of Isra'el \u2014 in the center stood Ya'azanyahu the son of Shafan. Each man had his incense-burner in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up. ", "12": "Then he said to me, \u201cHuman being, did you see what the leaders of the house of Isra'el are doing in the dark, each one in the room of his own carved image, because they say, 'Adonai can't see us; Adonai has left the land.'?\u201d ", "13": "He also said to me, \u201cYou will see even worse abominations that they are doing.\u201d", "14": "He brought me to the entrance of the north gate to Adonai's house; and there before me were women weeping for Tammuz. ", "15": "\u201cHuman being,\u201d he asked me, \u201chave you seen this? You will see practices even more disgusting than these.\u201d ", "16": "He brought me into the inner courtyard of Adonai's house; and there, at the entrance to the temple of Adonai, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Adonai and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east. ", "17": "He asked me, \u201cHuman being, have you seen this? Does the house of Y'hudah consider it a casual matter that they commit the disgusting practices they are committing here, thus filling the land with violence, provoking me still more? Look! They are even putting the branch to their nose! ", "18": "Therefore I will act in fury, my eye will not spare, I will have no pity. Even if they cry loudly right in my ears, I will not listen to them.\u201d"}

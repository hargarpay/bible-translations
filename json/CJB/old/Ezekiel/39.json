", "2": "I will turn you around, lead you on and bring you from the far reaches of the north against the mountains of Isra'el. ", "3": "But then I will knock your bow out of your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. ", "4": "You will fall on the mountains of Isra'el, you, your troops and all the peoples with you; I will give you to be eaten up by all kinds of birds of prey and by wild animals. ", "5": "You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken,' says Adonai Elohim.", "6": "\u201c'I will also send fire against Magog and against those living securely in the coastlands; then they will know that I am Adonai.

Thus they will plunder those who plundered them and rob those who robbed them,' says Adonai Elohim.", "11": "\u201c'When that day comes, I will give Gog a place there in Isra'el for graves, the Travelers' Valley, east of the sea; and it will block the travelers' passage. There they will bury Gog and all his horde, and they will rename it the Valley of Hamon-Gog [horde of Gog].

", "18": "You will eat the flesh of heroes and drink the blood of the earth's princes \u2014 rams, lambs, goats and bulls, fattened in Bashan, all of them.

{"1": "(0)\u00a0By David: (1)\u00a0Adonai, I am calling to you; my Rock, don't be deaf to my cry. For if you answer me with silence, I will be like those who fall in a pit.", "2": "Hear the sound of my prayers when I cry to you, when I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary.", "3": "Don't drag me off with the wicked, with those whose deeds are evil; they speak words of peace to their fellowmen, but evil is in their hearts.", "4": "Pay them back for their deeds, as befits their evil acts; repay them for what they have done, give them what they deserve.", "5": "For they don't understand the deeds of Adonai or what he has done. He will break them down; he will not build them up.", "6": "Blessed be Adonai, for he heard my voice as I prayed for mercy.", "7": "Adonai is my strength and shield; in him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. Therefore my heart is filled with joy, and I will sing praises to him.", "8": "Adonai is strength for [his people], a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.", "9": "Save your people! Bless your heritage! Shepherd them, and carry them forever!"}

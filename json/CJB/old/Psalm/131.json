{"1": "(0)\u00a0A song of ascents. By David: (1)\u00a0Adonai, my heart isn't proud; I don't set my sight too high, I don't take part in great affairs or in wonders far beyond me.", "2": "No, I keep myself calm and quiet, like a little child on its mother's lap \u2014 I keep myself like a little child.", "3": "Isra'el, put your hope in Adonai from now on and forever!"}

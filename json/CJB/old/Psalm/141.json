Listen to my plea when I call to you.", "2": "Let my prayer be like incense set before you, my uplifted hands like an evening sacrifice.", "3": "Set a guard, Adonai, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.", "4": "Don't let my heart turn to anything evil or allow me to act wickedly with men who are evildoers; keep me from eating their delicacies.", "5": "Let the righteous strike me, let him correct me; it will be an act of love. Let my head not refuse such choice oil, for I will keep on praying about their wickedness.", "6": "When their rulers are thrown down from the cliff, [the wicked] will hear that my words were fitting.", "7": "As when one plows and breaks the ground into clods, our bones are strewn at the mouth of Sh'ol.", "8": "For my eyes, Adonai, Adonai, are on you; in you I take refuge; don't pour out my life.", "9": "Keep me from the trap they have set for me, from the snares of evildoers.", "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety."}

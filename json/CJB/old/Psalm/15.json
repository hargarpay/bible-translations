{"1": "(0)\u00a0A psalm of David: (1)\u00a0Adonai, who can rest in your tent? Who can live on your holy mountain?", "2": "Those who live a blameless life, who behave uprightly, who speak truth from their hearts", "3": "and keep their tongues from slander; who never do harm to others or seek to discredit neighbors;", "4": "who look with scorn on the vile, but honor those who fear Adonai; who hold to an oath, no matter the cost;", "5": "who refuse usury when they lend money and refuse a bribe to damage the innocent. Those who do these things never will be moved."}

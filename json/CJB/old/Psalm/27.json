{"1": "(0)\u00a0By David: (1)\u00a0Adonai is my light and salvation; whom do I need to fear? Adonai is the stronghold of my life; of whom should I be afraid?", "2": "When evildoers assailed me to devour my flesh, my adversaries and foes, they stumbled and fell.", "3": "If an army encamps against me, my heart will not fear; if war breaks out against me, even then I will keep trusting.", "4": "Just one thing have I asked of Adonai; only this will I seek: to live in the house of Adonai all the days of my life, to see the beauty of Adonai and visit in his temple.", "5": "For he will conceal me in his shelter on the day of trouble, he will hide me in the folds of his tent, he will set me high on a rock.", "6": "Then my head will be lifted up above my surrounding foes, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, sing praises to Adonai.", "7": "Listen, Adonai, to my voice when I cry; show favor to me; and answer me.", "8": "\u201cMy heart said of you, 'Seek my face.'\u201d Your face, Adonai, I will seek.", "9": "Do not hide your face from me, don't turn your servant away in anger. You are my help; don't abandon me; don't leave me, God my savior.", "10": "Even though my father and mother have left me, Adonai will care for me.", "11": "Teach me your way, Adonai; lead me on a level path because of my enemies \u2014", "12": "don't give me up to the whims of my foes; for false witnesses have risen against me, also those who are breathing violence.", "13": "If I hadn't believed that I would see Adonai's goodness in the land of the living, . . .", "14": "Put your hope in Adonai, be strong, and let your heart take courage! Yes, put your hope in Adonai!"}

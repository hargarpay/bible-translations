{"1": "(0)\u00a0A song of ascents. By David: (1)\u00a0Oh, how good, how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in harmony.", "2": "It is like fragrant oil on the head that runs down over the beard, over the beard of Aharon, and flows down on the collar of his robes.", "3": "It is like the dew of Hermon that settles on the mountains of Tziyon. For it was there that Adonai ordained the blessing of everlasting life."}

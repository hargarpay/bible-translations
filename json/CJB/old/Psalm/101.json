{"1": "(0)\u00a0A psalm of David: (1)\u00a0I am singing of grace and justice; I am singing to you, Adonai.", "2": "I will follow the path of integrity; when will you come to me? I will run my life with a sincere heart inside my own house.", "3": "I will not allow before my eyes any shameful thing. I hate those who act crookedly; what they do does not attract me.", "4": "Deviousness will depart from me; I will not tolerate evil.", "5": "If someone slanders another in secret, I will cut him off. Haughty eyes and proud hearts I cannot abide.", "6": "I look to the faithful of the land, so that they can be my companions; those who live lives of integrity can be servants of mine.", "7": "No deceitful person can live in my house; no liar can be my advisor.", "8": "Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off all evildoers from the city of Adonai."}

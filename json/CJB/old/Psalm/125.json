{"1": "(0)\u00a0A song of ascents: (1)\u00a0Those who trust in Adonai are like Mount Tziyon, which cannot be moved but remains forever.", "2": "Yerushalayim! Mountains all around it! Thus Adonai is around his people henceforth and forever.", "3": "For the scepter of wickedness will not rule the inheritance of the righteous, so that the righteous will not themselves turn their hands to evil.", "4": "Do good, Adonai, to the good, to those upright in their hearts.", "5": "But as for those who turn aside to their own crooked ways, may Adonai turn them away, along with those who do evil. Shalom on Isra'el!"}

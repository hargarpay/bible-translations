{"1": "Judge me, God, and plead my cause against a faithless nation. Rescue me from those who deceive and from those who are unjust.", "2": "For you are the God of my strength; why have you thrust me aside? Why must I go about mourning, under pressure by the enemy?", "3": "Send out your light and your truth; let them be my guide; let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the places where you live.", "4": "Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and delight; I will praise you on the lyre, God, my God.", "5": "My soul, why are you so downcast? Why are you groaning inside me? Hope in God, since I will praise him again for being my Savior and God."}

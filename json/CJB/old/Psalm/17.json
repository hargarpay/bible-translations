Turn your ear to me, hear my words.", "7": "Show how wonderful is your grace, savior of those who seek at your right hand refuge from their foes.", "8": "Protect me like the pupil of your eye, hide me in the shadow of your wings", "9": "from the wicked, who are assailing me, from my deadly enemies, who are all around me.", "10": "They close their hearts to compassion; they speak arrogantly with their mouths;", "11": "they track me down, they surround me; they watch for a chance to bring me to the ground.", "12": "They are like lions eager to tear the prey, like young lions crouching in ambush.", "13": "Arise, Adonai, confront them! Bring them down! With your sword deliver me from the wicked,", "14": "with your hand, Adonai, from human beings, from people whose portion in life is this world. You fill their stomachs with your treasure, their children will be satisfied too and will leave their wealth to their little ones.", "15": "But my prayer, in righteousness, is to see your face; on waking, may I be satisfied with a vision of you."}

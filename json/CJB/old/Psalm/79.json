{"1": "(0)\u00a0A psalm of Asaf: (1)\u00a0God, the pagans have entered your heritage. They have defiled your holy temple and turned Yerushalayim into rubble.", "2": "They have given the corpses of your servants as food for the birds in the air, yes, the flesh of those faithful to you for the wild animals of the earth.", "3": "All around Yerushalayim they have shed their blood like water, and no one is left to bury them.", "4": "We suffer the taunts of our neighbors, we are mocked and scorned by those around us.", "5": "How long, Adonai? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?", "6": "Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you, on the kingdoms that don't call out your name;", "7": "for they have devoured Ya'akov and left his home a waste.", "8": "Don't count past iniquities against us, but let your compassion come quickly to meet us, for we have been brought very low.", "9": "Help us, God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name. Deliver us, forgive our sins, for your name's sake.", "10": "Why should the nations ask, \u201cWhere is their God?\u201d Let the vengeance taken on your servants' shed blood be known among the nations before our eyes.", "11": "Let the groaning of the captives come before you; by your great strength save those condemned to death.", "12": "Repay our neighbors sevenfold where they can feel it for the insults they inflicted on you, Adonai.", "13": "Then we, your people and the flock in your pasture, will give you thanks forever. From generation to generation we will proclaim your praise."}

{"1": "(0)\u00a0A song of ascents. By Shlomo: (1)\u00a0Unless Adonai builds the house, its builders work in vain. Unless Adonai guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain.", "2": "In vain do you get up early and put off going to bed, working hard to earn a living; for he provides for his beloved, even when they sleep.", "3": "Children too are a gift from Adonai; the fruit of the womb is a reward.", "4": "The children born when one is young. are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.", "5": "How blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them; he will not have to be embarrassed when contending with foes at the city gate."}

Who can stand in his holy place?", "4": "Those with clean hands and pure hearts, who don't make vanities the purpose of their lives or swear oaths just to deceive.", "5": "They will receive a blessing from Adonai and justice from God, who saves them.", "6": "Such is the character of those who seek him, of Ya'akov, who seeks your face. (Selah)", "7": "Lift up your heads, you gates! Lift them up, everlasting doors, so that the glorious king can enter!", "8": "Who is he, this glorious king?

Lift them up, everlasting doors, so that the glorious king can enter!", "10": "Who is he, this glorious king? Adonai-Tzva'ot \u2014 he is the glorious king. (Selah)"}

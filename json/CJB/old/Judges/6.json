It's your job to save him? Anyone who defends Ba'al will be put to death before morning! If he's a god, let him defend himself! After all, somebody destroyed his altar!\u201d ", "32": "Therefore on that day Gid'on was given the name Yeruba'al [let Ba'al defend], because they said, \u201cLet Ba'al defend himself against him, since he destroyed his altar.\u201d", "33": "Now all Midyan, 'Amalek and the others from the east joined forces, crossed the Yarden, and set up camp in the Yizre'el Valley.

{"1": "Meanwhile, Bo'az had gone up to the gate and had sat down there, when the redeemer of whom Bo'az had spoken passed by. \u201cSuch-and-such,\u201d he said, \u201ccome over, and sit down\u201d; so he came over and sat down. ", "2": "He took ten of the city's leaders and said, \u201cSit down here\u201d; and they sat down. ", "3": "Then he said to the redeeming kinsman, \u201cThe parcel of land which used to belong to our relative Elimelekh is being offered for sale by Na'omi, who has returned from the plain of Mo'av. ", "4": "I thought I should tell you about it and say, 'Buy it in the presence of the people sitting here and in the presence of the leaders of my people. If you want to redeem it, redeem it. But if it is not to be redeemed, then tell me, so that I can know, because there is no one else in line to redeem it, and I'm after you.\u201d He said, \u201cI want to redeem it.\u201d ", "5": "Then Bo'az said, \u201cThe same day you buy the field from Na'omi, you must also buy Rut the woman from Mo'av, the wife of the deceased [son], in order to raise up in the name of the deceased an heir for his property.\u201d ", "6": "The redeemer said, \u201cThen I can't redeem it for myself, because I might put my own inheritance at risk. You, take my right of redemption on yourself; because I can't redeem it.\u201d", "7": "In the past, this is what was done in Isra'el to validate all transactions involving redemption and exchange: a man took off his shoe and gave it to the other party; this was the form of attestation in Isra'el.

You are witnesses today.\u201d ", "11": "All the people at the gate and the leaders said, \u201cWe are witnesses. May Adonai make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Le'ah, who between them built up the house of Isra'el. Do worthy deeds in Efrat; become renowned in Beit-Lechem.

He had sexual relations with her, Adonai enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. ", "14": "Then the women said to Na'omi, \u201cBlessed be Adonai, who today has provided you a redeemer!

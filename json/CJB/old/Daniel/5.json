", "3": "So they brought the gold vessels which had been removed from the sanctuary of the house of God in Yerushalayim; and the king, his lords, his wives and his concubines drank from them. ", "4": "They drank their wine and praised their gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone.", "5": "Suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the palace wall by the lampstand. When the king saw the palm of the hand that was writing, ", "6": "the king's face took on a different look. As frightening thoughts rose up within him, his hip joints gave way and his knees started knocking together. ", "7": "The king cried out to bring in the exorcists, astrologers and diviners. The king said to the sages of Bavel, \u201cWhoever can read this inscription and tell me what it means will be dressed in royal purple, wear a gold chain around his neck and be one of the three men ruling the kingdom.\u201d ", "8": "But although all the king's sages came in, none could read the inscription or tell the king what it meant. ", "9": "Then King Belshatzar became terrified; his face turned pale, and his lords were thrown into confusion.", "10": "At this point the queen mother, because of what the king and his lords were saying, entered the banquet hall. The queen mother said, \u201cMay the king live forever! Don't be scared by your thoughts or let your face be so pale. ", "11": "There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods.

King N'vukhadnetzar your father \u2014 the king, your father \u2014 made him chief of the magicians, exorcists, astrologers and diviners; ", "12": "because he was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, discernment, and the ability to interpret dreams, unlock mysteries and solve knotty problems. He is called Dani'el, but the king gave him the name Belt'shatzar. Now have Dani'el summoned, and he will tell you what this means.\u201d", "13": "Dani'el was brought into the king's presence. The king said to Dani'el, \u201cAre you Dani'el, one of the exiles from Y'hudah whom the king my father brought out of Y'hudah?

", "15": "Now the sages, the exorcists, were brought in to me so that they could read this inscription and tell me what it means, but they couldn't interpret it for me. ", "16": "However, I've heard that you can give interpretations and solve knotty problems. Now if you can read the inscription and tell me what it means, you will be dressed in royal purple, wear a gold chain around your neck and be one of the three men ruling the kingdom.\u201d", "17": "Dani'el answered the king, \u201cKeep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else.

Anyone he wanted to, he put to death; anyone he wanted to, he kept alive; anyone he wanted to, he advanced; and anyone he wanted to, he humbled.

", "23": "Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven by having them bring you the vessels from his house; and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them; then you offered praise to your gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood and stone, which can't see, hear or know anything. Meanwhile, God, who holds your very breath in his hands, and to whom belongs everything you do, you have not glorified. ", "24": "This is why he sent the hand to write this inscription; ", "25": "and the inscription says, 'M'ne! M'ne! T'kel ufarsin.' [a] ", "26": "This is what it means: 'M'ne!' \u2014 God has counted up your kingdom and brought it to an end. ", "27": "'T'kel' \u2014 you are weighed on the balance-scale and come up short. ", "28": "'P'res' \u2014 your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.\u201d", "29": "Then Belshatzar gave the order; and they clothed Dani'el in royal purple, put a gold chain around his neck and proclaimed of him that he was to be one of the three men ruling the kingdom.", "30": "That very night Belshatzar, the king of the Kasdim, was killed."}

{"1": "(23:29)\u00a0From there David went up and lived in the strongholds of 'Ein-Gedi. ", "2": "(1)\u00a0When Sha'ul returned from pursuing the P'lishtim, he was told that David was in the desert at 'Ein-Gedi. ", "3": "(2)\u00a0Sha'ul took three thousand men chosen from all Isra'el and went searching for David and his men on the cliffs where the mountain goats are. ", "4": "(3)\u00a0Near some sheep pens along the way was a cave, and Sha'ul went inside to relieve himself. It happened that David and his men were sitting in the recesses at the back of the cave; ", "5": "(4)\u00a0and David's men said to him, \u201cLook! The day has come that Adonai told you about when he said to you, 'I will turn your enemy over to you, and you will do to him whatever seems good to you.'\u201d Then David stole over unobserved and cut off the corner of Sha'ul's cloak. ", "6": "(5)\u00a0But after doing this, David felt remorse over cutting Sha'ul's garment. ", "7": "(6)\u00a0He said to his men, \u201cAdonai forbid that I should do such a thing to my lord, Adonai's anointed, as raise my hand against him! After all, he is Adonai's anointed.\u201d ", "8": "(7)\u00a0By saying this, David stopped his men and would not let them do anything to Sha'ul. Sha'ul got up, left the cave and went on his way.", "9": "(8)\u00a0Then David too got up and went outside the cave, where he called after Sha'ul, \u201cMy lord the king!\u201d When Sha'ul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself. ", "10": "(9)\u00a0David said to Sha'ul, \u201cWhy do you listen to people who say, 'David is out to harm you?' ", "11": "(10)\u00a0Here, today you have seen with your own eyes that Adonai put you in my power there in the cave. Some of my men said I should kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I won't raise my hand against my lord, because he is Adonai's anointed.' ", "12": "(11)\u00a0Moreover, my father, look! Here in my hand you see the corner of your cloak. By the fact that I only cut off a piece of your cloak and didn't kill you, you can see and understand that I have no plan to do harm or rebel, and that I haven't sinned against you \u2014 even though you are seeking every chance you get to take my life. ", "13": "(12)\u00a0May Adonai judge between you and me, and may Adonai avenge me on you! But I will not lay a hand on you \u2014 ", "14": "(13)\u00a0as the old saying has it, 'Out of the wicked comes wickedness, but I will not lay a hand on you.' ", "15": "(14)\u00a0The king of Isra'el has come on a campaign \u2014 after whom? Whom are you chasing? A dead dog! A single flea!

", "19": "(18)\u00a0You have made it clear to me today that you have done me good; for when Adonai put my fate in your hands, you didn't kill me. ", "20": "(19)\u00a0A man finds his enemy and lets him go unharmed?! May Adonai reward you well for what you did to me today. ", "21": "(20)\u00a0Now I'm certain that you will indeed become king, and that the kingship of Isra'el will be established in your hands. ", "22": "(21)\u00a0So swear to me by Adonai that you will not kill my descendants after I die or blot out my name from my father's family.\u201d ", "23": "(22)\u00a0David swore to Sha'ul, and Sha'ul went home, but David and his men went back up to the stronghold."}

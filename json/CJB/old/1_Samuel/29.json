", "2": "The leaders of the P'lishtim were passing by with their hundreds and thousands; David and his men were bringing up the rear with Akhish. ", "3": "The chiefs of the P'lishtim asked, \u201cWhat are these Hebrews doing here?\u201d Akhish answered the chiefs of the P'lishtim, \u201cThis is David, who was a servant of Sha'ul, king of Isra'el. He's been with me now for well over a year, and I haven't found anything wrong with him between the time he deserted to me and now.\u201d ", "4": "But the chiefs of the P'lishtim became angry and said to him, \u201cHave the man return and go back to the place you set aside for him. Don't let him go into battle with us, because on the battlefield he might become our enemy. What better way could there be for him to get reconciled with his lord than by [cutting off] the heads of our men? ", "5": "This is David!

Nevertheless, the chiefs of the P'lishtim have said, 'He is not to go up with us to the battlefield.' ", "10": "So get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you; and as soon as you are up and it gets light, leave.\u201d ", "11": "David got up early in the morning, he and his men, to leave and go back into the land of the P'lishtim; while the P'lishtim continued up to Yizre'el."}

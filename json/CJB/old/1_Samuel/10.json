{"1": "Then Sh'mu'el took a flask of oil he had prepared and poured it on Sha'ul's head. He kissed him and said, \u201cAdonai has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance. ", "2": "After you leave me today, you will find two men by Rachel's Tomb, in the territory of Binyamin at Tzeltzah. They will tell you that the donkeys you were searching for have been found, and that your father has stopped thinking about the donkeys and is anxious over you and asking, 'What am I to do about my son?'\u201d ", "3": "Go on from there, and you will come to the Oak of Tavor. Three men will meet you there on their way up to God at Beit-El. One of them will be carrying three kids, another three loaves of bread and the third a skin of wine. ", "4": "They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you are to accept from them. ", "5": "After that, you will come to Giv'ah of God, where the P'lishtim are garrisoned. On arrival at the city there, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by lutes, tambourines, flutes and lyres; and they will be prophesying. ", "6": "Then the Spirit of Adonai will fall on you; you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man! ", "7": "When these signs come over you, just do whatever you feel like doing, because God is with you. ", "8": "Then you are to go down ahead of me to Gilgal, and there I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and present sacrifices as peace offerings. Wait there seven days, until I come to you and tell you what to do.\u201d", "9": "As it happened, as soon as he had turned his back to leave Sh'mu'el, God gave him another heart; and all those signs took place that day. ", "10": "When they arrived at the hill, and there in front of him was a group of prophets, the Spirit of God fell on him and he prophesied along with them. ", "11": "When those who knew him from before saw him there, prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, \u201cWhat's happened to Kish's son? Is Sha'ul a prophet, too?\u201d ", "12": "Someone in the crowd answered, \u201cMust prophets' fathers be special?\u201d So it became an expression \u2014 \u201cIs Sha'ul a prophet, too?\u201d", "13": "When he had finished prophesying, he arrived at the high place. ", "14": "Sha'ul's uncle said to him and his servant, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d He answered, \u201cTo look for the donkeys. When we saw that they hadn't been found, we went to Sh'mu'el.\u201d ", "15": "\u201cTell me, please,\u201d said Sha'ul's uncle, \u201cwhat Sh'mu'el said to you.\u201d ", "16": "Sha'ul answered his uncle, \u201cHe told us that the donkeys had been found,\u201d but said nothing to him about the matter of his being made king.", "17": "Sh'mu'el summoned the people to Adonai in Mitzpah. ", "18": "He said to the people of Isra'el, \u201cHere is what Adonai the God of Isra'el says: 'I brought Isra'el up from Egypt. I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.' ", "19": "But today you have rejected your God, who himself saves you from all your disasters and distress. You have said to him, 'No! Put a king over us!' So now, present yourselves before Adonai by your tribes and families.\u201d ", "20": "So Sh'mu'el had all the tribes come forward, and the tribe of Binyamin was chosen. ", "21": "He had the tribe of Binyamin come forward by families, and the family of the Matri was chosen, and Sha'ul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he couldn't be found. ", "22": "They asked Adonai, \u201cHas the man come here?\u201d Adonai answered, \u201cThere he is, hiding, in among the equipment.\u201d ", "23": "They ran and brought him from there, and when he stood among the people he was head and shoulders taller than anyone around. ", "24": "Sh'mu'el said to all the people, \u201cDo you see the man Adonai has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?\u201d Then all the people shouted, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d", "25": "Sh'mu'el told the people what kinds of rulings should be made in the kingdom, then wrote it on a scroll and set it down before Adonai. After that, he sent all the people away, everyone to his own home. ", "26": "Sha'ul too went home to Giv'ah, accompanied by warriors whose hearts God had touched. ", "27": "True, there were some scoundrels who said, \u201cHow can this man save us?\u201d They showed him no respect and brought him no gift, but he held his peace."}

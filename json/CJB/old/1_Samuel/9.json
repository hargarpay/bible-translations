He was a man of substance and brave as well. ", "2": "He had a son named Sha'ul who was young and good-looking; among the people of Isra'el there was no one better-looking than he; he stood head and shoulders taller than anyone else in Isra'el.", "3": "Once the donkeys belonging to Kish Sha'ul's father got lost. Kish said to his son Sha'ul, \u201cPlease take one of the servants with you, go out, and look for the donkeys.\u201d ", "4": "He went through the hills of Efrayim and the territory of Shalishah, but they didn't find them. Then they went through the territory of Sha'alim, but they weren't there. They went through the territory of Binyamin but didn't find them there either. ", "5": "On reaching the territory of Tzuf, Sha'ul said to his servant with him, \u201cCome, let's go back; otherwise my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.\u201d ", "6": "His servant replied, \u201cHere now, there's a man of God in this city, a man who is highly respected, and everything he says proves true. Let's go to him; maybe he can tell us something about where we should go.\u201d ", "7": "\u201cBut look,\u201d Sha'ul said to his servant, \u201cif we go to the man, what can we bring him? We've used up all the bread in our packs, and there's nothing for us to give the man of God \u2014 what do we have left?\u201d ", "8": "The servant replied again to Sha'ul: \u201cSee, I have here in my hand a silver quarter-shekel [one-tenth of an ounce]. I will give it to the man of God to tell us which way to go.\u201d ", "9": "(In Isra'el, back in the old days, when someone went to consult God, he would say, \u201cCome, let's go to the seer\u201d; because a person now called a prophet used to be called a seer.)

Hurry now, he just came into the city today, because the people are sacrificing today at the high place. ", "13": "Find him as soon as you enter the city, before he goes up to the high place to eat; because the people won't eat until he comes and blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards, the ones invited will eat. So go on up, because this is when you will find him.\u201d", "14": "They went up to the city; and as they entered the city, there was Sh'mu'el coming out toward them to go up to the high place.

Go up ahead of me to the high place, because you are going to dine with me today. In the morning, I will let you leave; and I will tell you everything that is on your heart. ", "20": "As for your donkeys that got lost three days ago, don't worry about them; they've been found. Now, who is it that all Isra'el wants? Isn't it you, and all your father's household?\u201d ", "21": "Sha'ul replied, \u201cI'm only a man from Binyamin, the smallest tribe in Isra'el; and my family is the least important of all the families in the tribe of Binyamin! Why are you saying such a thing to me?\u201d", "22": "Sh'mu'el took Sha'ul and his servant, brought them into the room and had them sit in the place reserved for the most important of the invited guests, who numbered about thirty persons.

About daybreak, Sh'mu'el called out to Sha'ul on the roof, \u201cGet up, so I can send you on your way.\u201d Sha'ul got up, and both of them \u2014 he and Sh'mu'el \u2014 went out. ", "27": "As they were going down, at the edge of the city, Sh'mu'el said to Sha'ul, \u201cTell the servant to go on ahead\u201d; so the servant went on. \u201cBut you, stand still now, because I want you to hear what God has said.\u201d"}

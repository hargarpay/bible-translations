{"1": "There was a man from Ramatayim-Tzofim, in the hills of Efrayim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Yerocham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tochu, the son of Tzuf, from Efrat. ", "2": "He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other P'ninah. P'ninah had children, but Hannah had no children. ", "3": "This man went up from his city every year to worship and sacrifice to Adonai-Tzva'ot in Shiloh. The two sons of 'Eli, Hofni and Pinchas, were cohanim of Adonai there.", "4": "One day, when Elkanah was sacrificing, he gave a portion of the sacrifice to his wife P'ninah and portions to each of her sons and daughters; ", "5": "but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved Hannah, even though Adonai had kept her from having children. ", "6": "Her rival taunted her and made her feel bad, because Adonai had kept her from having children. ", "7": "He did the same every year; and each time she went up to the house of Adonai, she taunted her so much that she would cry and not eat. ", "8": "Her husband Elkanah said to her, \u201cHannah, why are you crying, and why aren't you eating? Why be so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?\u201d ", "9": "So Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. 'Eli the cohen was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of Adonai. ", "10": "In deep depression she prayed to Adonai and cried. ", "11": "Then she took a vow; she said, \u201cAdonai-Tzva'ot, if you will notice how humiliated your servant is, if you will remember me and not forget your servant but will give your servant a male child, then I will give him to Adonai for as long as he lives; and no razor will ever come on his head.\u201d ", "12": "She prayed for a long time before Adonai; and as she did so, 'Eli was watching her mouth. ", "13": "Hannah was speaking in her heart \u2014 her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard \u2014 so 'Eli thought she was drunk. ", "14": "'Eli said to her, \u201cHow long are you going to stay drunk? Stop drinking your wine!\u201d ", "15": "But Hannah answered, \u201cNo, my lord, I am a very unhappy woman. I have not drunk either wine or other strong liquor; rather, I've been pouring out my soul before Adonai. ", "16": "Don't think of your servant as a worthless woman; because I have been speaking from the depth of my distress and anger.\u201d ", "17": "Then 'Eli replied, \u201cGo in peace. May the God of Isra'el grant what you have asked of him.\u201d ", "18": "She replied, \u201cMay your servant find favor in your sight.\u201d So the woman went on her way, and she ate, and her face was no longer sad. ", "19": "They got up early in the morning and worshipped before Adonai, then returned and came to their house in Ramah. Elkanah had sexual relations with Hannah his wife, and Adonai remembered her. ", "20": "She conceived; and in due time she gave birth to a son, whom she named Sh'mu'el, \u201cbecause I asked Adonai for him.\u201d", "21": "The husband, Elkanah, went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to Adonai and fulfill his vow. ", "22": "But Hannah did not go up, explaining to her husband, \u201cNot till the child has been weaned. Then I will bring him, so that he can appear before Adonai and live there forever.\u201d ", "23": "Her husband Elkanah answered her, \u201cDo what seems good to you; stay here until you have weaned him. Only may Adonai bring about what he said.\u201d So the woman stayed behind and nursed the child, until she weaned him. ", "24": "After weaning him, she took him up with her, along with three young bulls, a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Adonai in Shiloh, even though he was just a child. ", "25": "After the bull had been slaughtered, the child was brought to 'Eli; ", "26": "and she said, \u201cMy lord, as sure as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here near you, praying to Adonai. ", "27": "I prayed for this child, and Adonai has granted the request I asked of him. ", "28": "Therefore, I too have loaned him to Adonai \u2014 as long as he lives, he is on loan to Adonai.\u201d And he prostrated himself there before Adonai."}

", "7": "They replied, \u201cWhy does my lord speak this way? Heaven forbid that we should do such a thing! ", "8": "Why, the money we found inside our packs we brought back to you from the land of Kena'an! So how would we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?

There's no way we can clear ourselves! God has revealed your servants' guilt; so here we are, my lord's slaves \u2014 both we and also the one in whose possession the cup was found.\u201d ", "17": "But he replied, \u201cHeaven forbid that I should act in such a way.

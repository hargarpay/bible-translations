Therefore, please, let your servants live in the land of Goshen.\u201d ", "5": "Pharaoh said to Yosef, \u201cYour father and brothers have come to you, ", "6": "and the land of Egypt lies before you. Have your father and brothers live on the best property in the country \u2014 let them live in the land of Goshen. Moreover, if you know that some of them are particularly competent, put them in charge of my livestock.\u201d", "7": "Yosef then brought in Ya'akov his father and presented him to Pharaoh, and Ya'akov blessed Pharaoh. ", "8": "Pharaoh asked Ya'akov, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d ", "9": "and Ya'akov replied, \u201cThe time of my stay on earth has been 130 years; they have been few and difficult, fewer than the years my ancestors lived.\u201d ", "10": "Then Ya'akov blessed Pharaoh and left his presence.", "11": "(vii) 11\u00a0Yosef found a place for his father and brothers and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best region of the country, in the land of Ra'amses, as Pharaoh had ordered.

", "14": "Yosef collected all the money there was in Egypt and Kena'an in exchange for the grain they bought, and put the money in Pharaoh's treasury. ", "15": "When all the money in Egypt had been spent, and likewise in Kena'an, all the Egyptians approached Yosef and said, \u201cGive us something to eat, even though we have no money; why should we die before your eyes?\u201d ", "16": "Yosef replied, \u201cGive me your livestock. If you don't have money, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.\u201d ", "17": "So they brought Yosef their livestock; and Yosef gave them food in exchange for the horses, flocks, cattle and donkeys \u2014 all that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.", "18": "When that year was over, they approached Yosef again and said to him, \u201cWe won't hide from my lord that all our money is spent, and the herds of livestock belong to my lord.

Thus the land became the property of Pharaoh. ", "21": "As for the people, he reduced them to serfdom city by city, from one end of Egypt's territory to the other. ", "22": "Only the priests' land did he not acquire, because the priests were entitled to provisions from Pharaoh, and they ate from what Pharaoh provided them; therefore they did not sell their land.", "23": "Then Yosef said to the people, \u201cAs of today I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you to sow the land.

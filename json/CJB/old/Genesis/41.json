{"1": "At the end of two years, Pharaoh had a dream: he was standing beside the Nile River; ", "2": "and there came up out of the river seven cows, sleek and fat; and they began feeding in swamp grass. ", "3": "After them, there came up out of the river seven more cows, miserable-looking and lean; and they stood by the other cows at the edge of the river. ", "4": "Then the miserable-looking and lean cows ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. At this point Pharaoh woke up. ", "5": "But he went to sleep again and dreamt a second time: seven full, ripe ears of grain grew out of a single stalk. ", "6": "After them, seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up. ", "7": "And the thin ears swallowed up the seven full, ripe ears. Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it had been a dream.", "8": "In the morning he found himself so upset that he summoned all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one there could interpret them for him. ", "9": "Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \u201cToday reminds me of something wherein I am at fault: ", "10": "Pharaoh was angry with his officials and put me in the prison of the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.

He shaved himself, changed his clothes, and came in to Pharaoh.", "15": "(A: ii) 15\u00a0Pharaoh said to Yosef, \u201cI had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; but I've heard it said about you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it.\u201d ", "16": "Yosef answered Pharaoh, \u201cIt isn't in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer that will set his mind at peace.\u201d ", "17": "(S: ii) 17\u00a0Pharaoh said to Yosef, \u201cIn my dream, I stood at the edge of the river; ", "18": "and there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and sleek; and they began feeding in the swamp grass. ", "19": "After them, there came up out of the river seven more cows, poor, miserable-looking and lean \u2014 I've never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt! ", "20": "Then the lean and miserable-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows. ", "21": "But after they had eaten them up, one couldn't tell that they had eaten them; because they were as miserable-looking as before. At this point I woke up.

", "24": "And the thin ears swallowed up the seven ripe ears. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.\u201d", "25": "Yosef said to Pharaoh, \u201cThe dreams of Pharaoh are the same: God has told Pharaoh what he is about to do.

The famine will consume the land, ", "31": "and the abundance will not be known in the land because of the famine that will follow, because it will be truly terrible. ", "32": "Why was the dream doubled for Pharaoh? Because the matter has been fixed by God, and God will shortly cause it to happen.", "33": "\u201cTherefore, Pharaoh should look for a man both discreet and wise to put in charge of the land of Egypt. ", "34": "Pharaoh should do this, and he should appoint supervisors over the land to receive a twenty percent tax on the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. ", "35": "They should gather all the food produced during these good years coming up and set aside grain under the supervision of Pharaoh to be used for food in the cities, and they should store it.

There was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food. ", "55": "When the whole land of Egypt started feeling the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \u201cGo to Yosef, and do what he tells you to do.\u201d ", "56": "The famine was over all the earth, but then Yosef opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians, since the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.

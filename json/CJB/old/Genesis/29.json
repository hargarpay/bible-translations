{"1": "(ii) Continuing his journey, Ya'akov came to the land of the people of the east. ", "2": "As he looked, he saw a well in a field; and there were three flocks of sheep lying there next to it; because they watered the sheep from that well. The stone on the well's mouth was large, ", "3": "and only when all the flocks had gathered there would they roll the stone away from the opening of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place on the well's opening.", "4": "Ya'akov said to them, \u201cMy brothers, where are you from?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe're from Haran.\u201d ", "5": "He asked them, \u201cDo you know Lavan the [grand]son of Nachor?\u201d They said, \u201cWe do.\u201d ", "6": "He asked them, \u201cAre things going well with him?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d they answered, \u201cand here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.\u201d ", "7": "He said, \u201cLook, there's still plenty of daylight left; and it isn't time to bring the animals home; so water the sheep; then go, and put them out to pasture.\u201d ", "8": "They answered, \u201cWe can't, not until all the flocks have been gathered together, and they roll the stone away from the opening of the well. That's when we water the sheep.\u201d", "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, because she took care of them. ", "10": "When Ya'akov saw Rachel the daughter of Lavan his mother's brother, and the sheep of Lavan his mother's brother, Ya'akov went up and rolled the stone away from the opening of the well and watered the flock of Lavan his mother's brother. ", "11": "Ya'akov kissed Rachel and wept aloud. ", "12": "Ya'akov told Rachel that he was her father's relative, and that he was Rivkah's son; and she ran and told her father. ", "13": "When Lavan heard the news of Ya'akov his sister's son, he ran to meet him, hugged him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Ya'akov told Lavan all that had happened. ", "14": "Lavan said to him, \u201cYou are indeed my own flesh and blood.\u201d After Ya'akov had stayed with him for a whole month, ", "15": "Lavan said to him, \u201cWhy should you work for me for nothing, just because you are my relative? Tell me how much I should pay you.\u201d ", "16": "Now Lavan had two daughters; the name of the older was Le'ah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. ", "17": "Le'ah's eyes were weak; but Rachel was good-looking, with beautiful features.", "18": "(iii) 18\u00a0Ya'akov had fallen in love with Rachel and said, \u201cI will work for you seven years in exchange for Rachel your younger daughter.\u201d ", "19": "Lavan answered, \u201cBetter that I give her to you than to someone else; stay with me.\u201d ", "20": "So Ya'akov worked seven years for Rachel, and it seemed only a few days to him, because he was so much in love with her.", "21": "Ya'akov said to Lavan, \u201cGive me my wife, since my time is finished, so that I can start living with her.\u201d ", "22": "Lavan gathered all the men of the place and gave a banquet. ", "23": "In the evening he took Le'ah his daughter and brought her to Ya'akov, and he went in and slept with her. ", "24": "Lavan also gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Le'ah as her slave-girl.", "25": "In the morning Ya'akov saw that he was with Le'ah, and he said to Lavan, \u201cWhat kind of thing is this that you've done to me? Didn't I work for you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?\u201d ", "26": "Lavan answered, \u201cIn our place that isn't how it's done, to give the younger daughter before the firstborn. ", "27": "Finish the marriage week of this one, and we'll give you the other one also in exchange for the work you will do for me during yet another seven years.\u201d ", "28": "Ya'akov agreed to this, so he finished her week, and Lavan gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. ", "29": "Lavan also gave to his daughter Rachel his slave-girl Bilhah as her slave-girl. ", "30": "So not only did Ya'akov go in and sleep with Rachel, but he also loved Rachel more than Le'ah. Then he served Lavan another seven years.", "31": "Adonai saw that Le'ah was unloved, so he made her fertile, while Rachel remained childless. ", "32": "Le'ah conceived and gave birth to a son, whom she named Re'uven [see, a son!], for she said, \u201cIt is because Adonai has seen how humiliated I have been, but now my husband will love me.\u201d ", "33": "She conceived again, gave birth to a son and said, \u201cIt is because Adonai has heard that I am unloved; therefore he has given me this son also.\u201d So she named him Shim'on [hearing]. ", "34": "Once more she conceived and had a son; and she said, \u201cNow this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.\u201d Therefore she named him Levi [joining]. ", "35": "She conceived yet again, had a son and said, \u201cThis time I will praise Adonai\u201d; therefore she named him Y'hudah [praise]. Then she stopped having children."}

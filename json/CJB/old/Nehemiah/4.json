{"1": "(7)\u00a0But when Sanvalat, Toviyah, the Arabs, the 'Amonim and the Ashdodim heard that the repairs on the walls of Yerushalayim were going forward, and the breaks were being filled in, they became very angry. ", "2": "(8)\u00a0All of them together plotted to come and fight against Yerushalayim and thus throw us into confusion. ", "3": "(9)\u00a0However, we prayed to our God and, because of them, organized a watch against them day and night. ", "4": "(10)\u00a0Y'hudah was saying, \u201cThe strength of the people who carry loads away is starting to fail, and there is so much rubble that we can't build the wall.\u201d ", "5": "(11)\u00a0Our enemies were saying, \u201cThey won't know or see anything, until we have already infiltrated them and begun killing them and stopping the work.\u201d ", "6": "(12)\u00a0And even the Judeans living near them came and must have said to us ten times, \u201cFrom every place you must come back to us.\u201d", "7": "(13)\u00a0So in the lower parts of the space behind the wall, I stationed men according to their families, with their swords, spears and bows. ", "8": "(14)\u00a0After inspecting them, I stood up and addressed the nobles, leaders and the rest of the people: \u201cDon't be afraid of them! Remember Adonai, who is great and fearful; and fight for your brothers, sons, daughters, wives and homes.\u201d ", "9": "(15)\u00a0When our enemies heard that the plot was known to us, and God had foiled their plans, we all returned to the wall, everyone to his work. ", "10": "(16)\u00a0From then on, half of my men would do the work; and half of them held the spears, shields, bows and armor; while the leaders stood guard behind the entire house of Y'hudah, ", "11": "(17)\u00a0as they continued building the wall. Those who carried loads held their loads with one hand and carried a weapon in the other. ", "12": "(18)\u00a0As for the construction-workers, each one had his sword sheathed at his side; that is how they built. The man to sound the alarm on the shofar stayed with me. ", "13": "(19)\u00a0I said to the nobles, the leaders and the rest of the people, \u201cThis is a great work, and it is spread out; we are separated on the wall, one far from another. ", "14": "(20)\u00a0But wherever you are, when you hear the sound of the shofar, come to that place, to us. Our God will fight for us!\u201d", "15": "(21)\u00a0So we kept doing the work. Half of them held spears from daybreak until the stars appeared. ", "16": "(22)\u00a0Also at that time I told the people, \u201cLet everyone with a servant stay the night within Yerushalayim, so that at night they can be a guard for us, even as they work during the day.\u201d ", "17": "(23)\u00a0I, my kinsmen, my servants and my bodyguards never took off our clothes, and everyone who went to get water took his weapon."}

{"1": "When it was reported to Sanvalat, Toviyah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and that not a single gap was left in it \u2014 although up to that time I hadn't yet set up the doors in the gateways \u2014 ", "2": "Sanvalat and Geshem sent me a message which said, \u201cCome, let's meet together in one of the villages of the Ono Valley.\u201d But they were planning to do me harm; ", "3": "so I sent them messengers with this message: \u201cI'm too busy with important work to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?\u201d ", "4": "They kept sending this sort of message to me \u2014 four times \u2014 and I answered them the same way.", "5": "The fifth time, with the same purpose, Sanvalat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand, ", "6": "in which was written: \u201cIt is reported among the nations, and Geshem says it too, that you and the Judeans are planning a revolt, that this is why you are rebuilding the wall, and that you intend to be their king,\u201d and similar words; ", "7": "\u201cmoreover, that you have also appointed prophets to proclaim about you in Yerushalayim, 'There is a king in Y'hudah!' A report along these lines is now going to be made to the king. Come now, therefore, and let's discuss this.\u201d ", "8": "I sent him this answer; \u201cNothing like what you are saying is being done. You're making it all up in your head.\u201d ", "9": "They were all just trying to scare us, thinking, \u201cThis will sap their strength and keep them from working.\u201d But now, [God,] increase my strength!", "10": "One day, when I went to the house of Sh'ma'yah the son of D'layah, the son of M'heitav'el, where he was confined, he said, \u201cLet's meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let's shut the doors of the temple. For they are going to come and try to assassinate you; yes, they will come at night to kill you.\u201d ", "11": "I replied, \u201cShould a man like me run away? Can a man like me go into the temple to save his life? I refuse to go in.\u201d ", "12": "Then I realized that God had not sent him, that he was making this prophecy against me, and that Toviyah and Sanvalat had bribed him to say it.

", "16": "When all our enemies heard about it and the surrounding nations became afraid, our enemies' self-esteem fell severely; because they realized that this work had been accomplished by our God.", "17": "During this same period of time, the nobles of Y'hudah sent many letters to Toviyah, and Toviyah kept sending them replies. ", "18": "For there were many in Y'hudah who had sworn allegiance to him, because he was the son-in-law of Sh'khanyah the son of Arach, and his son Y'hochanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshulam the son of Berekhyah.

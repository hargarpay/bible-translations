{"1": "My sister, my bride, I have entered my garden; I am gathering my myrrh and my spices; I am eating my honeycomb along with my honey; I am drinking my wine as well as my milk. Eat, friends, and drink, until you are drunk with love!", "2": "I am asleep, but my heart is awake. Listen! I hear my darling knocking! Open for me, my sister, my love, my dove, my flawless one! For my head is wet with dew, my hair with the moisture of the night.", "3": "I've removed my coat; must I put it back on? I've washed my feet; must I dirty them again?", "4": "The man I love put his hand through the hole by the door-latch, and my heart began pounding at the thought of him.", "5": "I got up to open for the man I love. My hands were dripping with myrrh \u2014 pure myrrh ran off my fingers onto the handle of the bolt.", "6": "I opened for my darling, but my darling had turned and gone. My heart had failed me when he spoke \u2014 I sought him, but I couldn't find him; I called him, but he didn't answer.", "7": "The watchmen roaming the city found me; they beat me, they wounded me; they took away my cloak, those guardians of the walls!", "8": "I charge you, daughters of Yerushalayim, that if you find the man I love, what are you to tell him? That I am sick with love.", "9": "How does the man you love differ from any other, you most beautiful of women? How does the man you love differ from any other, that you should give us this charge?", "10": "The man I love is radiant and ruddy; he stands out among ten thousand.", "11": "His head is like the finest gold; his locks are wavy and black as a raven.", "12": "His eyes are like doves by running streams, bathed in milk and set just right.", "13": "His cheeks are like beds of spices, like banks of fragrant herbs. His lips are like lilies dripping with sweet myrrh.", "14": "His arms are rods of gold set with beryl, his body polished ivory adorned with sapphires.", "15": "His legs are like pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like the L'vanon, as imposing as the cedars.", "16": "His words are sweetness itself; he is altogether desirable. This is my darling, and this is my friend, daughters of Yerushalayim."}

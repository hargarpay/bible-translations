Now a creditor has come to take my two children as his slaves.\u201d ", "2": "Elisha asked her, \u201cWhat should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?\u201d She answered, \u201cYour servant has nothing in the house but a flask of oil.\u201d ", "3": "Then he said, \u201cGo, and borrow containers from all your neighbors, empty containers; and don't borrow just a few! ", "4": "Then go in; shut the door, with you and your sons inside; and pour oil into all those containers; and as they are filled, put them aside.\u201d ", "5": "So she left him and shut the door on herself and her sons. They brought her the containers while she poured. ", "6": "When the containers were full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another container\u201d; but he answered, \u201cThere isn't another container.\u201d Then the oil stopped flowing.

What can I do to show my appreciation? Do you want me to say anything to the king for you? or to the commander of the army?\u201d She answered, \u201cI'm happy living as I do, among my own people.\u201d ", "14": "He said, \u201cWhat, then, is to be done for her?\u201d Geichazi answered, \u201cThere's one thing \u2014 she doesn't have a son; and her husband is old.

I must get to the man of God as fast as I can; I'll come straight back.\u201d ", "23": "He asked, \u201cWhy are you going to him today? It isn't Rosh-Hodesh and it isn't Shabbat.\u201d She said, \u201cIt's all right.\u201d ", "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and ordered her servant, \u201cDrive as fast as you can; don't slow down for me unless I say so.\u201d", "25": "She set out and came to the man of God on Mount Karmel. When the man of God saw her in the distance, he said to Geichazi his servant, \u201cLook, here comes that Shunamit.

Geichazi came up to push her away, but the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone. She is in great distress, but Adonai has hidden from me what it is, he hasn't told me.\u201d ", "28": "Then she said, \u201cDid I ask my lord for a son? Didn't I say not to deceive me?\u201d ", "29": "Then Elisha said to Geichazi, \u201cGet dressed for action, take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, don't greet him; if anyone greets you, don't answer; and lay my staff on the child's face.\u201d ", "30": "The mother of the child said, \u201cAs Adonai lives, and as you live, I will not leave you. He got up and followed her. ", "31": "Geichazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the child's face, but there was no sound or sign of life. So he went back to Elisha and told him, \u201cThe child didn't wake up.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha reached the house, there the child was, dead and laid on the bed. ", "33": "He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to Adonai. ", "34": "Then he got up on the bed and lay on top of the child, putting his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands. As he stretched himself out on the child, its flesh began to grow warm. ", "35": "Then he went down, walked around in the house awhile, went back up and stretched himself out on the child again. The child sneezed seven times, then opened his eyes. ", "36": "Elisha called Geichazi and said, \u201cCall this Shunamit.\u201d So he called her; and when she came in to him, he said, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d ", "37": "She entered, fell at his feet and prostrated herself on the floor. Then she picked up her son and went out.", "38": "Elisha went back to Gilgal. At the time, there was a famine in the land. The guild prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his servant, \u201cPut the big pot on the fire, and boil some soup for the prophets.\u201d ", "39": "One of them went out to the field to gather vegetables and came upon a wild vine, from which he filled the front of his cloak with wild squash.

There's death in that pot!\u201d And they couldn't eat it.

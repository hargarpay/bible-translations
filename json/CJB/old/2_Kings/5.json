{"1": "Na'aman, commander of the king of Aram's army, was highly respected and esteemed by his master; because through him Adonai had brought victory to Aram. But although he was a brave warrior, he also suffered from tzara'at. ", "2": "Now on one of their raids into Isra'el's territory, Aram carried away captive a little girl, who became a servant for Na'aman's wife. ", "3": "She said to her mistress, \u201cI wish my lord could go to the prophet in Shomron! He could heal his tzara'at.\u201d ", "4": "Na'aman went in and told his lord, \u201cThe girl from the land of Isra'el said such-and-such.\u201d ", "5": "The king of Aram said, \u201cGo now, and I will send a letter to the king of Isra'el.\u201d He set out, taking with him 660 pounds of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold and ten changes of clothes. ", "6": "He brought the king of Isra'el the letter, which said, \u201cWhen this letter reaches you, you will see that I have sent my servant Na'aman to you, so that you can heal his tzara'at.\u201d ", "7": "When the king of Isra'el finished reading the letter, he tore his clothes. \u201cAm I God, able to kill and make alive,\u201d he asked, \u201cso that he sends me a man to heal of tzara'at? You can see that he is only seeking an excuse to quarrel with me.\u201d ", "8": "But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Isra'el had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: \u201cWhy did you tear your clothes? Just have him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Isra'el.\u201d", "9": "So Na'aman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha's house. ", "10": "Elisha sent a messenger to him, who said, \u201cGo, and bathe in the Yarden seven times. Your skin will become as it was, and you will be clean.\u201d ", "11": "But Na'aman became angry and left, saying, \u201cHere now! I thought for certain that he would come out personally, that he would stand, call on the name of Adonai his God and wave his hand over the diseased place and thus heal the person with tzara'at. ", "12": "Aren't Amanah and Parpar, the rivers of Dammesek, better than all the water in Isra'el? Why can't I bathe in them and be clean?\u201d So he turned and went off in a rage. ", "13": "But his servants approached him and said, \u201cMy father! If the prophet had asked you to do something really difficult, wouldn't you have done it? So, doesn't it make even more sense to do what he says, when it's only, 'Bathe, and be clean'?\u201d ", "14": "So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Yarden, as the man of God had said to do; and his skin was restored and became like the skin of a child; and he became clean.", "15": "Then, with his whole retinue, he returned to the man of God, went and stood before him, and said, \u201cWell, I've learned that there is no God in all the earth except in Isra'el; therefore, please accept a present from your servant.\u201d ", "16": "But Elisha answered, \u201cAs Adonai lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.\u201d And despite his urging him to take it, he refused. ", "17": "So Na'aman said, \u201cIf you won't take it, then please let your servant be given as much earth as two mules can carry; because from now on, your servant will offer neither burnt offerings nor sacrifices to other gods, but only to Adonai. ", "18": "Except this, and may Adonai forgive your servant for it: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon \u2014 when I bow down, may Adonai forgive your servant for this.\u201d ", "19": "Elisha said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d Na'aman had gone only a short distance from him, ", "20": "when Geichazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, \u201cHere, my master has made it easy on this Arami Na'aman by not accepting from him what he brought. As Adonai lives, I'll run after him and get at least something from him.\u201d ", "21": "So Geichazi hurried off after Na'aman. When Na'aman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d ", "22": "\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy master sent me with this message: 'Two young men have just now come to me, guild prophets from the hills of Efrayim. Would you be kind enough to give them a talent of silver [sixty-six pounds] and two changes of clothes?\u201d ", "23": "\u201cBy all means, take two talents!\u201d said Na'aman, pressing him. He tied up the two talents of silver in two bags and gave them, with the two changes of clothes, to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Geichazi. ", "24": "On reaching the hill, he took the bags from them and put them away in the house. Then he let the men go, and they left. ", "25": "He went in and stood before his master. Elisha asked, \u201cWhere have you been, Geichazi?\u201d \u201cYour servant hasn't gone anywhere,\u201d he said. ", "26": "Elisha said to him, \u201cWasn't my heart there with you when the man left his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to receive silver and clothing \u2014 and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female slaves? ", "27": "Therefore Na'aman's tzara'at will cling to you and your descendants forever.\u201d He left Elisha's presence with tzara'at as white as snow."}

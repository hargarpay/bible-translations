{"1": "\u201cThen we turned and began traveling into the desert along the road to the Sea of Suf, as Adonai had said to me; and we skirted Mount Se'ir for a long time. ", "2": "(v) 2\u00a0Finally Adonai said to me, ", "3": "'You have been going around this mountain long enough! Head north, ", "4": "and give this order to the people: \u201cYou are to pass through the territory of your kinsmen the descendants of 'Esav who live in Se'ir. They will be afraid of you, so be very cautious, ", "5": "and don't get into disputes with them; for I am not going to give you any of their land, no, not even enough for one foot to stand on; inasmuch as I have given Mount Se'ir to 'Esav as his possession. ", "6": "Pay them money for the food you eat, and pay them money for the water you drink. ", "7": "For Adonai your God has blessed you in everything your hands have produced. He knows that you have been traveling through this vast desert; these forty years Adonai your God has been with you; and you have lacked nothing.'", "8": "\u201cSo we went on past our kinsmen the descendants of 'Esav living in Se'ir, left the road through the 'Aravah from Eilat and 'Etzyon-Gever, and turned to pass along the road through the desert of Mo'av. ", "9": "Adonai said to me, 'Don't be hostile toward Mo'av or fight with them, because I will not give you any of their land to possess, since I have already given 'Ar to the descendants of Lot as their territory.'\u201d ", "10": "(The Emim used to live there, a great and numerous people as tall as the 'Anakim.

", "12": "In Se'ir the Horim used to live, but the descendants of 'Esav dispossessed and destroyed them, settling in their place. Isra'el did similarly in the land it came to possess, which Adonai gave to them.) ", "13": "\u201c'Now get going, and cross Vadi Zered!' \u201cSo we crossed Vadi Zered. ", "14": "The time between our leaving Kadesh-Barnea and our crossing Vadi Zered was thirty-eight years \u2014 until the whole generation of men capable of bearing arms had been eliminated from the camp, as Adonai had sworn they would be. ", "15": "Moreover, Adonai's hand was against them to root them out of the camp until the last of them was gone. ", "16": "When all the men who were able to bear arms had died and were no longer part of the people, ", "17": "Adonai said to me, ", "18": "'Today you are to cross the border of Mo'av at 'Ar.

Here, I have put in your hands Sichon the Emori, king of Heshbon, and his land; commence the conquest, begin the battle! ", "25": "Today I will start putting the fear and dread of you into all the peoples under heaven, so that the mere mention of your name will make them quake and tremble before you.'", "26": "\u201cI sent envoys from the K'demot Desert to Sichon king of Heshbon with a peaceable message, ", "27": "'Let me pass through your land. I will keep to the road, turning neither right nor left. ", "28": "You will sell me food to eat for money and give me water to drink for money. I only want to pass through. ", "29": "Do as the people of 'Esav living in Se'ir and the Mo'avim living in 'Ar did with me, until I cross the Yarden into the land Adonai our God is giving us.'", "30": "\u201cBut Sichon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through his territory, because Adonai your God had hardened his spirit and made him stubborn, so that he could hand him over to you, as is the case today.

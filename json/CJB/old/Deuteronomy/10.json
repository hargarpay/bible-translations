", "2": "I will inscribe on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you are to put them in the ark.' ", "3": "So I made an ark of acacia-wood and cut two stone tablets like the first, then climbed the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. ", "4": "He inscribed the tablets with the same inscription as before, the Ten Words which Adonai proclaimed to you from the fire on the mountain the day of the assembly; and Adonai gave them to me.

", "7": "From there they traveled to Gudgod, and from Gudgod to Yotvatah, a region with running streams. ", "8": "At that time Adonai set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark for the covenant of Adonai and to stand before Adonai to serve him and to bless in his name, as they still do today.

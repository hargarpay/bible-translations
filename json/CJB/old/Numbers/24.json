Then the Spirit of God came upon him, ", "3": "and he made his pronouncement: \u201cThis is the speech of Bil'am, son of B'or; the speech of the man whose eyes have been opened;", "4": "the speech of him who hears God's words; who sees what Shaddai sees, who has fallen, yet has open eyes:", "5": "\u201cHow lovely are your tents, Ya'akov; your encampments, Isra'el!", "6": "They spread out like valleys, like gardens by the riverside, like succulent aloes planted by Adonai, like cedar trees next to the water.", "7": "\u201cWater will flow from their branches, their seed will have water aplenty.

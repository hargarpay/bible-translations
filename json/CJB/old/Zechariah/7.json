{"1": "In the fourth year of King Daryavesh, on the fourth day of the ninth month, Kislev, a message from Adonai came to Z'kharyah. ", "2": "He sent Sar'etzer and Regem-Melekh with his men to Beit-El in order to ask Adonai's favor, ", "3": "as they inquired of the cohanim of the house of Adonai-Tzva'ot and the prophets, \u201cShould we go into mourning and abstain from pleasure during the fifth month, as we have been doing for all these years?\u201d ", "4": "It was then that this message came to me from Adonai-Tzva'ot: ", "5": "\u201cSpeak to all the people of the land and to the cohanim. Tell them, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months throughout these seventy years, were you really fasting for me? Was it for me? ", "6": "Rather, when you eat and drink, it's just to please yourselves, isn't it? ", "7": "Isn't this just what Adonai proclaimed through the earlier prophets, when Yerushalayim was inhabited and prosperous, as were the cities around her; and the Negev and the Sh'felah were inhabited?'\u201d", "8": "Then this message from Adonai came to Z'kharyah: ", "9": "\u201cIn the past Adonai-Tzva'ot said, 'Administer true justice.

Thus the land was left desolate after them, so that no one came or went. They had turned a pleasant land into a desert.\u201d"}

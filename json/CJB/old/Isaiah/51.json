For Torah will go out from me; I will calm them with my justice as a light for the peoples.", "5": "My righteousness is at hand, my salvation goes out, my arms will judge the peoples. The coastlands are putting their hope in me, trusting in my arm.", "6": "\u201cRaise your eyes toward the skies, look at the earth below.

Why are you afraid of a man, who must die; of a human being, who will wither like grass?", "13": "You have forgotten Adonai, your maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. Instead, you are in constant fear all day because of the oppressor's rage, as he prepares to destroy!

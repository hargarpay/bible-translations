He comes like a hailstorm, a destructive tempest, like a flood of water, rushing, overwhelming; with his hand he hurls them to the ground.", "3": "The haughty crown of Efrayim's drunks is trampled underfoot;", "4": "and the fading flower of its proud splendor, located at the head of the rich valley, is like the first ripe fig of summer \u2014 whoever sees it picks and eats it.", "5": "On that day, Adonai-Tzva'ot will be a glorious crown, a brilliant diadem for the remnant of his people.", "6": "He will also be a spirit of justice for whoever sits as a judge, and a source of strength for those repelling enemy attacks at the gate.", "7": "But there are others reeling from wine, staggering about because of strong liquor; cohen and prophet reel from strong liquor, they are confused by wine. Led astray by strong liquor, they err in their visions and stumble when judging.", "8": "All tables are covered with vomit and feces, not a single place is clean.", "9": "Can no one be taught anything? Can no one understand the message?

Listen, earth! For Adonai is speaking. \u201cI raised and brought up children, but they rebelled against me.", "3": "An ox knows its owner and a donkey its master's stall, but Isra'el does not know, my people do not reflect.", "4": "\u201cOh, sinful nation, a people weighed down by iniquity, descendants of evildoers, immoral children!

I get no pleasure from the blood of bulls, lambs and goats!", "12": "Yes, you come to appear in my presence; but who asked you to do this, to trample through my courtyards?", "13": "Stop bringing worthless grain offerings! They are like disgusting incense to me! Rosh-Hodesh, Shabbat, calling convocations \u2014 I can't stand evil together with your assemblies!", "14": "Everything in me hates your Rosh-Hodesh and your festivals; they are a burden to me \u2014 I'm tired of putting up with them!", "15": "\u201cWhen you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; no matter how much you pray, I won't be listening; because your hands are covered with blood.", "16": "\u201cWash yourselves clean!

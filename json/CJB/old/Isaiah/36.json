", "5": "I say: do mere words constitute strategy and strength for battle? In whom, then, are you trusting when you rebel against me like this? ", "6": "Look! Relying on Egypt is like using a broken stick as a staff \u2014 when you lean on it, it punctures your hand. That's what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like for anyone who puts his trust in him.

{"1": "Woe to those going down to Egypt expecting help \u2014 relying on horses; trusting in chariots, because they have many, and in the strength of their cavalrymen \u2014 but not looking to the Holy One of Isra'el, not consulting Adonai.", "2": "But he too is wise and can bring disaster, and he does not take back his words; he will rise against the house of evildoers and against the help of those who do wrong.", "3": "Now the Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit. So when Adonai stretches out his hand, both he who helps will stumble, and he who is helped will fall; both will perish together.", "4": "For here is what Adonai says to me: \u201cAs a lion or lion cub growls at its prey and isn't frightened away by the shouts of hordes of shepherds called out against him \u2014 their voices do not upset him \u2014 so likewise Adonai-Tzva'ot will descend to fight on Mount Tziyon, on its hill.", "5": "Like hovering birds, Adonai-Tzva'ot will protect Yerushalayim. In protecting it, he will rescue it; in sparing it, he will save it.", "6": "People of Isra'el! Return to him to whom you have been so deeply disloyal!", "7": "For on that day everyone will discard his idols of silver and idols of gold, which you made for yourselves with your own sinful hands.", "8": "Then Ashur will fall by a sword not of mortals, a sword, not of humans, will devour him; he will flee before the sword, and his young men will be put to forced labor.", "9": "His rock, out of terror, will pass away, and his panicked officers will desert the standard.\u201d So says Adonai, whose fire is in Tziyon, whose furnace is in Yerushalayim."}

{"1": "In the year of King 'Uziyahu's death I saw Adonai sitting on a high, lofty throne! The hem of his robe filled the temple. ", "2": "S'rafim stood over him, each with six wings \u2014 two for covering his face, two for covering his feet and two for flying. ", "3": "They were crying out to each other, \u201cMore holy than the holiest holiness is Adonai-Tzva'ot! The whole earth is filled with his glory!\u201d", "4": "The doorposts shook at the sound of their shouting, and the house was filled with smoke. ", "5": "Then I said, \u201cWoe to me! I [too] am doomed! \u2014 because I, a man with unclean lips, living among a people with unclean lips, have seen with my own eyes the King, Adonai-Tzva'ot!\u201d", "6": "One of the s'rafim flew to me with a glowing coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. ", "7": "He touched my mouth with it and said, \u201cHere! This has touched your lips. Your iniquity is gone, your sin is atoned for.\u201d", "8": "Then I heard the voice of Adonai saying, \u201cWhom should I send? Who will go for us?\u201d I answered, \u201cI'm here, send me!\u201d ", "9": "He said, \u201cGo and tell this people: 'Yes, you hear, but you don't understand. You certainly see, but you don't get the point!'", "10": "\u201cMake the heart of this people [sluggish with] fat, stop up their ears, and shut their eyes. Otherwise, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, then understanding with their hearts, they might repent and be healed!\u201d", "11": "I asked, \u201cAdonai, how long?\u201d and he answered, \u201cUntil cities become uninhabited ruins, houses without human presence, the land utterly wasted;", "12": "until Adonai drives the people far away, and the land is one vast desolation.", "13": "If even a tenth [of the people] remain, it will again be devoured. \u201cBut like a pistachio tree or an oak, whose trunk remains alive after its leaves fall off, the holy seed will be its trunk.\u201d"}

Here I am!' to a nation not called by my name.", "2": "I spread out my hands all day long to a rebellious people who live in a way that is not good, who follow their own inclinations;", "3": "a people who provoke me to my face all the time, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense on bricks.", "4": "They sit among the graves and spend the night in caverns; they eat pig meat and their pots hold soup made from disgusting things.", "5": "They say, 'Keep your distance, don't come near me, because I am holier than you.' These are smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all day!", "6": "See, it is written before me; I will not be silent until I repay them; I will repay them to the full,", "7": "your own crimes and those of your ancestors together,\u201d says Adonai. \u201cThey offered incense on the mountains and insulted me on the hills.

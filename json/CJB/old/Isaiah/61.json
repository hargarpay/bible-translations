{"1": "The Spirit of Adonai Elohim is upon me, because Adonai has anointed me to announce good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted; to proclaim freedom to the captives, to let out into light those bound in the dark;", "2": "to proclaim the year of the favor of Adonai and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn,", "3": "yes, provide for those in Tziyon who mourn, giving them garlands instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, a cloak of praise instead of a heavy spirit, so that they will be called oaks of righteousness planted by Adonai, in which he takes pride.", "4": "They will rebuild the ancient ruins, restore sites long destroyed; they will renew the ruined cities, destroyed many generations ago.", "5": "Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, foreigners plow your land and tend your vines;", "6": "but you will be called cohanim of Adonai, spoken of as ministers to our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and revel in their riches.", "7": "Because of your shame, which was doubled, and because they cried, \u201cThey deserve disgrace,\u201d therefore in their land what they own will be doubled, and joy forever will be theirs.", "8": "\u201cFor I, Adonai, love justice; I hate robbery for burnt offerings. So I will be faithful to reward them and make an eternal covenant with them.\u201d", "9": "Their descendants will be known among the nations, their offspring among the peoples; all who see them will acknowledge that they are the seed Adonai has blessed.", "10": "I am so joyful in Adonai! My soul rejoices in my God, for he has clothed me in salvation, dressed me with a robe of triumph, like a bridegroom wearing a festive turban, like a bride adorned with her jewels.", "11": "For just as the earth brings forth its plants, or a garden makes its plants spring up, so Adonai, God, will cause victory and glory to spring up before all nations."}

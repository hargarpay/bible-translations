{"1": "This is a prophecy about Bavel, which Yesha'yahu the son of Amotz saw:", "2": "Hoist a banner on a high mountain, shout to [the invaders]; beckon them to enter the Nobles' Gate.", "3": "\u201cI have ordered my holy ones, summoned my heroes, eager and bold, to execute my anger.\u201d", "4": "Listen! A tumult on the mountains \u2014 it sounds like a vast multitude! Listen! The uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathering together! Adonai-Tzva'ot is mustering an army for war.", "5": "They come from a distant land, from beyond the horizon. It's Adonai, with the weapons of his rage, to lay waste to all the earth.", "6": "Howl! for the Day of Adonai is at hand, destruction coming from Shaddai.", "7": "This is why every arm will hang limp and everyone's courage melt away.", "8": "They will be gripped by panic, seized with pain and agony, writhing like a woman in labor, looking aghast at each other, faces aflame.", "9": "Here comes the Day of Adonai, full of cruelty, rage and hot fury, to desolate the earth and destroy the sinners in it.", "10": "For the stars, the constellations in the sky, will no longer give their light; the sun will be dark when it rises; and the moon will no longer shine.", "11": "\u201cI will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity.

Arabs will not pitch tents there nor shepherds bring their flocks.", "21": "But wildcats will lie there, their houses will be full of owls, ostriches will live there, and wild goats will dance there.", "22": "Jackals will howl in their palaces and wild dogs in their temples of delight. Its time is close at hand, its days will not last long."}

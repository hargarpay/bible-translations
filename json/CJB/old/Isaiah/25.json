This is our God! We waited for him to save us. This is Adonai ; we put our hope in him. We are full of joy, so glad he saved us!\u201d", "10": "For on this mountain the hand of Adonai will rest. But Mo'av will be trampled down where they are, like straw trampled into a pile of manure.", "11": "They will spread out their hands in Mo'av, like a swimmer using his hands to tread water; but their pride will be humbled and sunk, no matter how clever the strokes of their hands.", "12": "Your high, fortified walls he will level, strike to the ground, lay in the dust."}

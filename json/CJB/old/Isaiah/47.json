For you will no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms.", "6": "I was angry with my people, I desecrated my own possession and gave them over to you. But you showed them no mercy; you made your yoke very heavy, even upon the aged.", "7": "You said, 'I will be mistress forever.' so you didn't consider these things or think about the consequences.", "8": "Now hear this, you lover of luxuries, lolling at ease and saying to yourself, 'I am important, and no one else!

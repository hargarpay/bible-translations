{"1": "Adonai says: \u201cWhere is your mother's divorce document which I gave her when I divorced her? Or: to which of my creditors did I sell you? You were sold because of your sins; because of your crimes was your mother divorced.", "2": "Why was no one here when I came? Why, when I called, did nobody answer? Is my arm too short to redeem? Have I too little power to save? With my rebuke I dry up the sea; I turn rivers into desert, their fish rot for lack of water and they die of thirst;", "3": "I dress the heavens in black to mourn and make their covering sackcloth.\u201d", "4": "Adonai Elohim has given me the ability to speak as a man well taught, so that I, with my words, know how to sustain the weary. Each morning he awakens my ear to hear like those who are taught.", "5": "Adonai Elohim has opened my ear, and I neither rebelled nor turned away.", "6": "I offered my back to those who struck me, my cheeks to those who plucked out my beard; I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.", "7": "For Adonai Elohim will help. This is why no insult can wound me. This is why I have set my face like flint, knowing I will not be put to shame.", "8": "My vindicator is close by; let whoever dares to accuse me appear with me in court! Let whoever has a case against me step forward!", "9": "Look, if Adonai Elohim helps me, who will dare to condemn me? Here, they are all falling apart like old, moth-eaten clothes.", "10": "Who among you fears Adonai? Who obeys what his servant says? Even when he walks in the dark, without any light, he will trust in Adonai's reputation and rely on his God.", "11": "But all of you who are lighting fires and arming yourselves with firebrands: go, walk in the flame of your own fire, among the firebrands you lit! From my hands this [fate] awaits you: you will lie down in torment."}

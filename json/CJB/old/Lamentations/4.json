Their skin has shriveled over their bones and become as dry as a stick.", "9": "Those slain by the sword are better off than those who are dying from hunger; since these waste away as if pierced through, for lack of food from the fields.", "10": "With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children; their children became their food when the daughter of my people was destroyed.", "11": "Adonai has finished with his fury, he has poured out his blazing wrath; he kindled a fire in Tziyon that consumed its very foundations.", "12": "The kings of the earth could not believe, neither could anyone living in the world, that enemy or foe would ever enter the gates of Yerushalayim.", "13": "It happened because of the sins of her prophets and the offenses of her cohanim, who, within her walls, shed the blood of the righteous.", "14": "They wander in the streets like the blind; they are so polluted with blood that nobody is able even to touch their clothing.", "15": "\u201cKeep away!

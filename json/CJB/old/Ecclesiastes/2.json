", "2": "Of laughter I said, \u201cThis is stupid,\u201d and of pleasure, \u201cWhat's the use of it?\u201d", "3": "I searched my mind for how to gratify my body with wine and, with my mind still guiding me with wisdom, how to pursue foolishness; my object was to find out what was the best thing for people to do during the short time they have under heaven to live. ", "4": "I worked on a grand scale \u2014 I built myself palaces, planted myself vineyards, ", "5": "and made myself gardens and parks; in them I planted all kinds of fruit trees. ", "6": "I made myself pools from which to water the trees springing up in the forest. ", "7": "I bought male and female slaves, and I had my home-born slaves as well. I also had growing herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, more than anyone before me in Yerushalayim. ", "8": "I amassed silver and gold, the wealth of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, things that provide sensual delight, and a good many concubines. ", "9": "So I grew great, surpassing all who preceded me in Yerushalayim; my wisdom, too, stayed with me. ", "10": "I denied my eyes nothing they wanted. I withheld no pleasure from myself; for I took pleasure in all my work, and this was my reward for all my work.

", "13": "I saw that wisdom is more useful than foolishness, just as light is more useful than darkness.", "14": "The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet the same fate awaits them all.", "15": "So I said to myself, \u201cIf the same thing happens to the fool as to me, then what did I gain by being wise?\u201d and I thought to myself, \u201cThis too is pointless. ", "16": "For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered, inasmuch as in the times to come, everything will long ago have been forgotten.

", "21": "Here is a man whose work is done with wisdom, knowledge and skill; yet he has to leave it to someone who has put no work into it. This is not only pointless, but a great evil.

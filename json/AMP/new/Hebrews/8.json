", "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is essential for this One also to have something to offer. ", "4": "Now if He were [still living] on earth, He would not be a priest at all, for there are priests who offer the gifts [to God] in accordance with the Law. ", "5": "They serve as a pattern and foreshadowing of [what has its true existence and reality in] the heavenly things (sanctuary). For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was warned by God, saying, \u201cSee that you make it all [exactly] according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.\u201d ", "6": "But as it is, Christ has acquired a [priestly] ministry which is more excellent [than the old Levitical priestly ministry], for He is the Mediator (Arbiter) of a better covenant [uniting God and man], which has been enacted and rests on better promises.", "7": "For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one or an attempt to institute another one [the new covenant].

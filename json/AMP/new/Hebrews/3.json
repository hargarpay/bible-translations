{"1": "Therefore, [a]holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, [thoughtfully and attentively] consider the Apostle and High Priest whom we confessed [as ours when we accepted Him as Savior], namely, [b]Jesus; ", "2": "He was faithful to Him who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. ", "3": "Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater glory and honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house. ", "4": "For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. ", "5": "Now Moses was faithful in [the administration of] all God's house, [but only] as a ministering servant, [his ministry serving] as a testimony of the things which were to be spoken afterward [the revelation to come in Christ]; ", "6": "but Christ is faithful as a Son over His [Father's] house. And we are His house if we hold fast our confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ].", "7": "Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, \u201cToday if you hear His voice,", "8": "\u00a0 Do not harden your hearts as [your fathers did] in the rebellion [of Israel at [c]Meribah], On the day of testing in the wilderness,", "9": "\u00a0 Where your fathers tried Me by testing [My forbearance and tolerance], And saw My works for forty years [And found I stood their test].", "10": "\u00a0 \u201cTherefore I was angered with this generation, And I said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they did not know My ways [nor become progressively better and more intimately acquainted with them]';", "11": "\u00a0 So I swore [an oath] in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest [the promised land].'\u201d", "12": "Take care, brothers and sisters, that there not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving [d]heart [which refuses to trust and rely on the Lord, a heart] that turns away from the living God. ", "13": "But continually encourage one another every day, as long as it is called \u201cToday\u201d [and there is an opportunity], so that none of you will be hardened [into settled rebellion] by the deceitfulness of sin [its cleverness, delusive glamour, and sophistication]. ", "14": "For we [believers] have become partakers of Christ [sharing in all that the Messiah has for us], if only we hold firm our newborn confidence [which originally led us to Him] until the end, ", "15": "while it is said, \u201cToday [while there is still opportunity] if you hear His voice, Do not harden your heart, as when they provoked Me [in the rebellion in the desert at Meribah].\u201d", "16": "For who were they who heard and yet provoked Him [with rebellious acts]? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? ", "17": "And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies were scattered in the desert? ", "18": "And to whom did He swear [an oath] that they would not enter His rest, but to those who disobeyed [those who would not listen to His word]? ", "19": "So we see that they were not able to enter [into His rest\u2014the promised land] because of unbelief and an unwillingness to trust in God."}

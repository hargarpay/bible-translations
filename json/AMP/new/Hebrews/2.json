{"1": "[a]For this reason [that is, because of God's final revelation in His Son Jesus and because of Jesus' superiority to the angels] we must pay much closer attention than ever to the things that we have heard, so that we do not [in any way] drift away from truth. ", "2": "For if the message given [b]through angels [the Law given to Moses] was authentic and unalterable, and every violation and disobedient act received an appropriate penalty, ", "3": "how will we escape [the penalty] if we ignore such a great salvation [the gospel, the new covenant]? For it was spoken at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us and proved authentic by those who personally heard [Him speak], ", "4": "[and besides this evidence] God also testifying with them [confirming the message of salvation], both by signs and wonders and by various miracles [carried out by Jesus and the apostles] and by [granting to believers the] gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.", "5": "It was not to angels that God subjected the [inhabited] world of the future [when Christ reigns], about which we are speaking.

But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him.", "9": "But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while [by taking on the limitations of humanity], crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering of death, so that by the grace of God [extended to sinners] He might experience death for [the sins of] everyone.", "10": "For it was fitting for God [that is, an act worthy of His divine nature] that He, for whose sake are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the [d]author and founder of their salvation perfect through suffering [bringing to maturity the human experience necessary for Him to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest]. ", "11": "Both Jesus who sanctifies and those who are sanctified [that is, spiritually transformed, made holy, and set apart for God's purpose] are all from one Father; for this reason He is not ashamed to call them [e]brothers and sisters, ", "12": "saying, \u201cI will declare Your (the Father's) name to My brethren (believers), In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your praise.\u201d", "13": "And again [[f]He says], \u201cMy trust and confident hope will be placed in Him.\u201d And again, \u201cHere I am, I and the children whom God has given Me.\u201d", "14": "Therefore, since [these His] children share in flesh and blood [the physical nature of mankind], He Himself in a similar manner also shared in the same [physical nature, but without sin], so that through [experiencing] death He might make powerless (ineffective, impotent) him who had the power of death\u2014that is, the devil\u2014 ", "15": "and [that He] might free all those who through [the haunting] fear of death were held in slavery throughout their lives.

[These are all important matters in which you should have been proficient long ago.] ", "3": "And we will do this [that is, proceed to maturity], if God permits. ", "4": "For [it is impossible to restore to repentance] those who have once been enlightened [spiritually] and who have [a]tasted and consciously experienced the heavenly gift and have shared in the Holy Spirit, ", "5": "and have tasted and consciously experienced the good word of God and the powers of the age (world) to come, ", "6": "[b]and then have fallen away\u2014it is impossible to bring them back again to repentance, since they again nail the Son of God on the cross [for as far as they are concerned, they are treating the death of Christ as if they were not saved by it], and are holding Him up again to public disgrace.

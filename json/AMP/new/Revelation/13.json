Then I saw a [vicious] beast coming up out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten royal [b]crowns (diadems), and on his heads were blasphemous names. ", "2": "And the beast that I saw resembled a [c]leopard, but his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth was like that of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. ", "3": "I saw one of his heads which seemed to have a fatal wound, but his fatal wound was healed; and the entire earth followed after the beast in amazement. ", "4": "They fell down and worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; they also worshiped the beast, saying, \u201cWho is like (as great as) the beast, and who is able to wage war against him?\u201d ", "5": "And the beast was given a mouth (the power of speech), uttering great things and arrogant and blasphemous words, and he was given freedom and authority to act and to do as he pleased for [d]forty-two months (three and a half years). ", "6": "And he opened his mouth to speak blasphemies (abusive speech, slander) against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those who live in heaven.", "7": "He was also [e]permitted to wage war against the saints (God's people) and to overcome them, and authority and power over every tribe and people and language and nation.

Here is [the call for] the patient endurance and the faithfulness of the saints [which is seen in the response of God's people to difficult times].", "11": "Then I saw [f]another beast rising up out of the earth; he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.

{"1": "Now [a]Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord [and relentless in his search for believers], went to the [b]high priest, ", "2": "and he asked for letters [of authority] from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any men or women there belonging to [c]the Way [believers, followers of Jesus the Messiah], men and women alike, he could arrest them and bring them bound [with chains] to Jerusalem. ", "3": "As he traveled he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him [displaying the glory and majesty of Christ]; ", "4": "and he fell to the ground and heard a voice [from heaven] saying to him, \u201cSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting and oppressing Me?\u201d ", "5": "And Saul said, \u201cWho are You, Lord?\u201d And He answered, \u201cI am Jesus whom you are persecuting, ", "6": "now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.\u201d ", "7": "The men who were traveling with him [were terrified and] stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. ", "8": "Saul got up from the ground, but though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. ", "9": "And he was unable to see for three days, and he neither ate nor drank.", "10": "Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, \u201cAnanias.\u201d And he answered, \u201cHere I am, Lord.\u201d ", "11": "And the Lord said to him, \u201cGet up and go to the street called [d]Straight, and ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul; for he is praying [there], ", "12": "and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him, so that he may regain his sight.\u201d ", "13": "But Ananias answered, \u201cLord, I have heard from many people about this man, especially how much suffering and evil he has brought on Your saints (God's people) at Jerusalem; ", "14": "and here [in Damascus] he has authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on Your name [confessing You as Savior].\u201d ", "15": "But the Lord said to him, \u201cGo, for this man is a [deliberately] chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; ", "16": "for I will make clear to him how much he must suffer and endure for My name's sake.\u201d ", "17": "So Ananias left and entered the house, and he laid his hands on Saul and said, \u201cBrother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came [to Damascus], has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit [in order to proclaim Christ to both Jews and Gentiles].\u201d ", "18": "Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized; ", "19": "and he took some food and was strengthened. For several days [afterward] Saul remained with the disciples who were at Damascus. ", "20": "And immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues, saying, \u201cThis Man is the Son of God [the promised Messiah]!\u201d ", "21": "All those who heard him continued to be amazed and said, \u201cIs this not the man who in Jerusalem attacked those who called on this name [of Jesus], and had come here [to Damascus] for the express purpose of bringing them bound [with chains] before the chief priests?\u201d ", "22": "But Saul increased in strength more and more, and continued to perplex the Jews who lived in Damascus by examining [theological evidence] and proving [with Scripture] that this Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).", "23": "After considerable time had passed [about three years or so], the Jews plotted together to kill him, ", "24": "but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the city's gates day and night so they could kill him; ", "25": "but his disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket.", "26": "When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. ", "27": "However, [e]Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and described to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road [to Damascus], and how He had spoken to him, and how at Damascus Saul had preached openly and spoken confidently in the name of Jesus. ", "28": "So he was with them, moving around freely [as one among them] in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. ", "29": "He was talking and arguing with the [f]Hellenists (Greek-speaking Jews); but they were attempting to kill him. ", "30": "When the brothers found out [about the plot], they brought him down to [g]Caesarea [Maritima] and sent him off to Tarsus [his home town].", "31": "So the church throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace [without persecution], being built up [in wisdom, virtue, and faith]; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort and encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it continued to grow [in numbers].", "32": "Now as Peter was traveling throughout the land, he went down to [visit] the [h]saints (God's people) who lived at Lydda. ", "33": "There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. ", "34": "Peter said to him, \u201cAeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed.\u201d Immediately Aeneas got up. ", "35": "Then all who lived at Lydda and the plain of Sharon saw [what had happened to] him, and they turned to the Lord.", "36": "Now in [i]Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, (which translated into Greek means Dorcas). She was rich in acts of kindness and charity which she continually did. ", "37": "During that time it happened that she became sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upstairs room. ", "38": "Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, \u201cCome to us without delay.\u201d ", "39": "So Peter got up [at once] and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upstairs room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing [him] all the [j]tunics and robes that Dorcas used to make while she was with them. ", "40": "But Peter sent them all out [of the room] and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, \u201cTabitha, arise!\u201d And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. ", "41": "And he gave her his hand and helped her up; and then he called in the [k]saints (God's people) and the widows, and he presented her [to them] alive. ", "42": "This became known all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord [that is, to adhere to and trust in and rely on Jesus as Christ and Savior]. ", "43": "And so it was that Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with Simon, [l]a tanner."}

", "2": "So the [c]Twelve called the disciples together and said, \u201cIt is not appropriate for us to neglect [teaching] the word of God in order to serve tables and manage the distribution of food. ", "3": "Therefore, brothers, choose from among you seven men with good reputations [men of godly character and moral integrity], full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task.

{"1": "Now after Paul and Silas had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. ", "2": "And Paul entered the synagogue, as was his [a]custom, and for three Sabbaths he engaged in discussion and friendly debate with them from the Scriptures, ", "3": "explaining and pointing out [scriptural evidence] that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, \u201cThis Jesus, whom I am proclaiming to you, is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).\u201d ", "4": "And some of them were persuaded to believe and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and many of the leading women. ", "5": "But the [unbelieving] Jews became jealous, and taking along some thugs from [the lowlifes in] the market place, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and then attacking Jason's house tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people. ", "6": "But when they failed to find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city authorities, shouting, \u201cThese men who have turned the world upside down have come here too; ", "7": "and Jason has welcomed them [into his house and protected them]! And they all are saying things contrary to the decrees of Caesar, [actually] claiming that there is another king, Jesus.\u201d ", "8": "They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things. ", "9": "And when they had taken security (bail) from Jason and the others, they let them go.", "10": "The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea; and when they arrived, they entered the Jewish synagogue. ", "11": "Now these people were more noble and open-minded than those in Thessalonica, so they received the message [of salvation through faith in the Christ] with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. ", "12": "As a result many of them became believers, together with a number of prominent Greek women and men. ", "13": "But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God [concerning eternal salvation through faith in Christ] had also been preached by Paul at Berea, they came there too, agitating and disturbing the crowds. ", "14": "So at that time the brothers immediately sent Paul away to go as far as the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there [at Berea]. ", "15": "Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens; and [after] receiving instructions [from Paul] for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible, they left.", "16": "Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was greatly angered when he saw that the city was full of idols. ", "17": "So he had discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place day after day with any who happened to be there. ", "18": "And some of the [b]Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to engage in conversation with him. And some said, \u201cWhat could this idle babbler [with his eclectic, scrap-heap learning] have in mind to say?\u201d Others said, \u201cHe seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities\u201d\u2014because he was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. ", "19": "They took him and brought him to the [c]Areopagus (Hill of Ares, the Greek god of war), saying, \u201cMay we know what this [strange] new teaching is which you are proclaiming? ", "20": "For you are bringing some startling and strange things to our ears; so we want to know what they mean.\u201d ", "21": "(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners visiting there used to spend their [leisure] time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)", "22": "So Paul, standing in the center of the Areopagus, said: \u201cMen of Athens, I observe [with every turn I make throughout the city] that you are very religious and devout in all respects. ", "23": "Now as I was going along and carefully looking at your objects of worship, I came to an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN [d]UNKNOWN GOD.' Therefore what you already worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. ", "24": "The God who created the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; ", "25": "nor is He [e]served by human hands, as though He needed anything, because it is He who gives to all [people] life and breath and all things. ", "26": "And He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands and territories. ", "27": "This was so that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grasp for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us. ", "28": "For in Him we live and move and exist [that is, in Him we actually have our being], as even some of [f]your own poets have said, 'For we also are His children.' ", "29": "So then, being God's children, we should not think that the Divine Nature (deity) is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination or skill of man. ", "30": "Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to repent [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God's purpose for their lives], ", "31": "because He has set a day when He will judge the inhabited world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed and destined for that task, and He has provided credible proof to everyone by raising Him from the dead.\u201d", "32": "Now when they heard [the term] resurrection from the dead, [g]some mocked and sneered; but others said, \u201cWe will hear from you again about this matter.\u201d ", "33": "So Paul left them. ", "34": "But some men joined him and believed; among them were Dionysius, [a judge] of the Council of Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."}

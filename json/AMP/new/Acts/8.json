{"1": "Saul wholeheartedly approved of Stephen's death. And on that day a great and relentless persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem; and the believers were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles. ", "2": "Some devout men buried Stephen, and [a]mourned greatly over him [expressing a personal sense of loss]. ", "3": "But Saul began ravaging the church [and assaulting believers]; entering house after house and dragging off men and women, putting them in prison.", "4": "Now those [believers] who had been scattered went from place to place preaching the word [the good news of salvation through Christ]. ", "5": "[b]Philip [the evangelist] went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) to them. ", "6": "The crowds gathered and were paying close attention to everything Philip said, as they heard [the message] and saw the [miraculous] signs which he was doing [validating his message]. ", "7": "For unclean spirits (demons), shouting loudly, were coming out of many who were possessed; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. ", "8": "So there was great rejoicing in that city.", "9": "Now there was a man named Simon, who previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. ", "10": "They all paid [a great deal of] attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, \u201cThis man is what is called the Great Power of God!\u201d ", "11": "They were paying attention to him because for a long time he had mystified and dazzled them with his magic. ", "12": "But when they believed Philip as he preached the [c]good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, both men and women. ", "13": "Even Simon believed [Philip's message of salvation]; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he watched the attesting signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.", "14": "When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that [the people of] Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. ", "15": "They came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; ", "16": "for He had not yet fallen on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus [as His possession]. ", "17": "Then Peter and John laid their hands on them [one by one], and they received the Holy Spirit. ", "18": "Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, ", "19": "saying, \u201cGive me this authority and power too, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\u201d ", "20": "But Peter said to him, \u201cMay your money be destroyed along with you, because you thought you could buy the [free] gift of God with money! ", "21": "You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart (motive, purpose) is not right before God. ", "22": "So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, this thought of your heart may be forgiven you. ", "23": "For I see that you are [d]provoked by bitterness and bound by sin.\u201d ", "24": "But Simon answered, \u201cPray to the Lord for me both of you, so that nothing of what you have said will come upon me.\u201d", "25": "So, when Peter and John had given their testimony and preached the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, preaching the good news [about salvation] in many Samaritan villages [along the way].", "26": "But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \u201cGet up and go south to the road that runs from Jerusalem down to Gaza.\u201d (This is a desert road). ", "27": "So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch [a man of great authority], a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship, ", "28": "and he was returning, and sitting in his chariot he was reading [the scroll of] the prophet Isaiah. ", "29": "Then the [Holy] Spirit said to Philip, \u201cGo up and join this chariot.\u201d ", "30": "Philip ran up and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah, and asked, \u201cDo you understand what you are reading?\u201d ", "31": "And he said, \u201cWell, how could I [understand] unless someone guides me [correctly]?\u201d And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. ", "32": "Now this was the passage of Scripture which he was reading: \u201cLike a sheep He was led to the slaughter; And as a lamb before its shearer is silent, So He does not open His mouth.", "33": "\u00a0 \u201cIn humiliation His judgment was taken away [justice was denied Him].

About himself or about someone else?\u201d ", "35": "Then Philip spoke and beginning with this Scripture he preached Jesus to him [explaining that He is the promised Messiah and the source of salvation]. ", "36": "As they continued along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch exclaimed, \u201cLook! Water! What forbids me from being baptized?\u201d ", "37": "[e][Philip said to him, \u201cIf you believe with all your heart, you may.\u201d And he replied, \u201cI do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\u201d] ", "38": "And he ordered that the chariot be stopped; and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. ", "39": "When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord [suddenly] took Philip [and carried him] away [to a different place]; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but he went on his way rejoicing. ", "40": "But Philip found himself at [f]Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the good news [of salvation] to all the cities, until he came to [g]Caesarea [Maritima]."}

{"1": "It is necessary to boast, though nothing is gained by it; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. ", "2": "I know a [a]man in Christ who fourteen years ago\u2014whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, [only] God knows\u2014such a man was caught up to the [b]third heaven. ", "3": "And I know that such a man\u2014whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, [only] God knows\u2014 ", "4": "was caught up into [c]Paradise and heard inexpressible words which man is not permitted to speak [words too sacred to tell]. ", "5": "On behalf of such a man [and his experiences] I will boast; but in my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses. ", "6": "If I wish to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be speaking the truth. But I abstain [from it], so that no one will credit me with more than [is justified by what] he sees in me or hears from me.", "7": "Because of the surpassing greatness and extraordinary nature of the revelations [which I received from God], for this reason, to keep me from thinking of myself as important, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, to torment and harass me\u2014to keep me from exalting myself! ", "8": "Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might leave me; ", "9": "but He has said to me, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you [My lovingkindness and My mercy are more than enough\u2014always available\u2014regardless of the situation]; for [My] power is being perfected [and is completed and shows itself most effectively] in [your] weakness.\u201d Therefore, I will all the more gladly boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ [may completely enfold me and] may dwell in me. ", "10": "So I am well pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, and with difficulties, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak [in human strength], then I am strong [truly able, truly powerful, truly drawing from God's strength].", "11": "Now I have become foolish; you have forced me [by questioning my apostleship]. Actually I should have been commended by you [instead of being treated disdainfully], for I was not inferior to those [d]super-apostles, even if I am nobody. ", "12": "The signs that indicate a genuine apostle were performed among you fully and most patiently\u2014signs and wonders and miracles. ", "13": "For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except [for the fact] that I did not burden you [with my financial support]? Forgive me [for doing you] this injustice!", "14": "Now for the third time I am ready to visit you. I will not burden you [financially], because I do not want what is yours [not your money or your possessions], but you. For children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. ", "15": "But I will very gladly spend [my own resources] and be utterly spent for your souls. If I love you greatly, am I to be loved less [by you]? ", "16": "But be that as it may, I did not burden you [with my support]. But [some say that] I was sly and took you by trickery. ", "17": "Did I take advantage of you or make any money off you through any of the messengers I sent you? [Certainly not!] ", "18": "I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? [No!] Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps? [Of course!]", "19": "All this time you have been thinking that we are [merely] defending ourselves to you. It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking [as one] in Christ; and everything, dearly beloved, is to strengthen you [spiritually]. ", "20": "For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you not to be as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish\u2014that perhaps there may be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder; ", "21": "I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality and decadence which they formerly practiced."}

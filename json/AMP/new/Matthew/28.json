", "2": "And a great earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone [from the opening of the tomb], and sat on it. ", "3": "The angel's appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow. ", "4": "The guards shook, paralyzed with fear [at the sight] of him and became like dead men [pale and immobile].

", "6": "He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said [He would]. Come! See the place where He was lying.

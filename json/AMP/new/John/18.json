{"1": "Having said these things, Jesus left with His disciples and went across the [a]ravine of the Kidron. There was a garden there, which He and His disciples entered. ", "2": "Now Judas, who was betraying Him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. ", "3": "So Judas, having obtained the Roman [b]cohort and some officers from the high priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. ", "4": "Then Jesus, knowing all that was about to happen to Him, went to them and asked, \u201cWhom do you want?\u201d ", "5": "They answered Him, \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cI am He.\u201d And Judas, who was betraying Him, was also standing with them. ", "6": "When Jesus said, \u201cI am He,\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground. ", "7": "Again He asked them, \u201cWhom do you want?\u201d And they said, \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d ", "8": "Jesus answered, \u201cI told you that I am He; so if you want Me, let these men go on their way.\u201d ", "9": "This was to fulfill and verify the words He had spoken, \u201cOf those whom You have given Me, I have not lost even one.\u201d ", "10": "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. ", "11": "So Jesus said to Peter, \u201cPut the sword [back] in its sheath! Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?\u201d", "12": "So the cohort and their commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him, ", "13": "and led Him to [c]Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. ", "14": "It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.", "15": "Simon Peter and [d]another disciple were following Jesus. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, so he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the [residence of the] high priest; ", "16": "but Peter was standing outside at the door. So the other disciple (John), who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter inside. ", "17": "Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, \u201cYou are not one of this Man's disciples, are you?\u201d He said, \u201cI am not.\u201d ", "18": "Now the servants and the officers had made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. And Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.", "19": "Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching. ", "20": "Jesus answered him, \u201cI have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [area], where all the Jews habitually congregate; and I said nothing in secret. ", "21": "Why question Me? Question those who have heard what I said to them. They know what I said.\u201d ", "22": "But when He said this, one of the officers who was standing nearby [e]struck Jesus [in the face], saying, \u201cIs that how You answer the high priest?\u201d ", "23": "Jesus replied, \u201cIf I have said anything wrong, make a formal statement about the wrong; but if [I spoke] properly, why did you strike Me?\u201d ", "24": "So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Now Simon Peter was [still] standing and warming himself. So they said to him, \u201cYou are not one of His disciples, are you?\u201d He denied it and said, \u201cI am not.\u201d ", "26": "One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, said, \u201cDid I not see you with Him in the garden?\u201d ", "27": "So Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.", "28": "Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium (governor's palace). Now it was early and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium so that they would not be [ceremonially] unclean, but might [be able to] eat [and participate in the Feast of Unleavened Bread which began after] the [f]Passover [supper]. ", "29": "So Pilate came out to them and asked, \u201cWhat accusation do you bring against this Man?\u201d ", "30": "They answered, \u201cIf He were not a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to you [for judgment].\u201d ", "31": "Then Pilate said to them, \u201cTake Him yourselves and judge Him according to your own law.\u201d The Jews said, \u201cWe are not permitted to put anyone to death.\u201d ", "32": "This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to indicate by what manner of death He was going to die.", "33": "So Pilate went into the Praetorium again, and called Jesus and asked Him, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d ", "34": "Jesus replied, \u201cAre you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?\u201d ", "35": "Pilate answered, \u201cI am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and their chief priests have handed You over to me. What have You done [that is worthy of death]?\u201d ", "36": "Jesus replied, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world [nor does it have its origin in this world]. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would be fighting [hard] to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this world.\u201d ", "37": "So Pilate said to Him, \u201cThen You are a King?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou say [correctly] that I am a King. This is why I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth [who is a friend of the truth and belongs to the truth] hears and listens carefully to My voice.\u201d ", "38": "Pilate said to Him [scornfully], \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d And when he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, \u201cI find no guilt in Him [no crime, no cause for an accusation]. ", "39": "But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. So shall I release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d ", "40": "Then they all shouted back again, \u201cNot this Man, but Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas was a [g]robber."}

{"1": "While He was passing by, He noticed a man [who had been] blind from birth. ", "2": "His disciples asked Him, \u201cRabbi (Teacher), who [a]sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?\u201d ", "3": "Jesus answered, \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned, but it was so that the works of God might be displayed and illustrated in him. ", "4": "We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. ", "5": "As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world [giving guidance through My word and works].\u201d ", "6": "When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made mud with His saliva, and He spread the mud [like an ointment] on the man's eyes. ", "7": "And He said to him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of [b]Siloam\u201d (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing. ", "8": "So the neighbors, and those who used to know him as a beggar, said, \u201cIs not this the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d ", "9": "Some said, \u201cIt is he.\u201d Still others said, \u201cNo, but he looks like him.\u201d But he kept saying, \u201cI am the man.\u201d ", "10": "So they said to him, \u201cHow were your eyes opened?\u201d ", "11": "He replied, \u201cThe Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed, and I received my sight!\u201d ", "12": "They asked him, \u201cWhere is He?\u201d He said, \u201cI do not know.\u201d", "13": "Then they brought the man who was formerly blind to the Pharisees. ", "14": "Now it was on a Sabbath day that Jesus made the mud and opened the man's eyes. ", "15": "So the Pharisees asked him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, \u201cHe smeared mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.\u201d ", "16": "Then some of the Pharisees said, \u201cThis Man [Jesus] is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.\u201d But others said, \u201cHow can a man who is a sinner (a non-observant Jew) do such signs and miracles?\u201d So there was a difference of opinion among them. ", "17": "Accordingly they said to the blind man again, \u201cWhat do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?\u201d And he said, \u201c[It must be that] He is a [c]prophet!\u201d", "18": "However, the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the man's parents. ", "19": "They asked them, \u201cIs this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?\u201d ", "20": "His parents answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; ", "21": "but as to how he now sees, we do not know; or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him [and stop asking us]; [d]he is of age, he will speak for himself and give his own account of it.\u201d ", "22": "His parents said this because they were afraid of [the leaders of] the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged Jesus to be the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue (excommunicated). ", "23": "Because of this his parents said, \u201cHe is of age; ask him.\u201d", "24": "So a second time they called the man who had been [born] blind, and said to him, \u201cGive God glory and praise [for your sight]! We know this Man [Jesus] is a sinner [separated from God].\u201d ", "25": "Then he answered, \u201cI do not know whether He is a sinner [separated from God]; but one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.\u201d ", "26": "So they said to him, \u201cWhat did He [actually] do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d ", "27": "He answered, \u201cI already told you and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again and again? Do you want to become His disciples, too?\u201d ", "28": "And [at that remark] they stormed at him and jeered, \u201cYou are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses! ", "29": "We know [for certain] that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this Man, we do not know where He is from.\u201d ", "30": "The man replied, \u201cWell, this is astonishing! You do not know where He comes from, and yet He opened my eyes! ", "31": "We know [according to your tradition] that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone fears God and does His will, He hears him. ", "32": "Since the [e]beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. ", "33": "If this Man were not from God, He would not be able to do anything [like this because God would not hear His prayer].\u201d ", "34": "They answered him, \u201cYou were [f]born entirely in sins [from head to foot], and you [presume to] teach us?\u201d Then they threw him out [of the synagogue].", "35": "Jesus heard that they had [g]put him out [of the synagogue], and finding him, He asked, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d ", "36": "He answered, \u201cWho is He, Sir? Tell me so that I may believe in Him.\u201d ", "37": "Jesus said to him, \u201cYou have both seen Him, and [in fact] He is the one who is talking with you.\u201d ", "38": "And he said, \u201cLord, I believe [in You and Your word]!\u201d And he worshiped Him [with reverence and awe]. ", "39": "Then Jesus said, \u201cI came into this world for judgment [to separate those who believe in Me from those who reject Me\u2014to declare judgment on those who choose to be separated from God], so that the sightless would see, and those who see would become blind.\u201d ", "40": "Some Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, \u201cAre we also blind?\u201d ", "41": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf you were blind [to spiritual things], you would have no sin [and would not be blamed for your unbelief]; but since you claim to have [spiritual] sight, [you have no excuse so] your sin and guilt remain."}

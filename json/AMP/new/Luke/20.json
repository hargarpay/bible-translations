{"1": "On one of the days, as Jesus was instructing the people in the temple [area] and preaching the good news (gospel), [a]the chief priests and the scribes along with the elders confronted Him, ", "2": "and said to Him, \u201cTell us by what kind of authority You are doing these things? Or who is the one who gave You this authority?\u201d ", "3": "Jesus replied, \u201cI will also ask you a question. You tell Me: ", "4": "The baptism of John [the Baptist]\u2014was it from heaven [that is, ordained by God] or from men?\u201d ", "5": "They discussed and debated it among themselves, saying, \u201cIf we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why did you not believe him?' ", "6": "But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are firmly convinced that John was a prophet.\u201d ", "7": "So they replied that they did not know from where it came. ", "8": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cNor am I telling you by what [kind of] authority I do these things.\u201d", "9": "Then He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time [to another country].

I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will have respect for him.' ", "14": "But when the tenants saw him, they discussed it among themselves, saying, 'This [man] is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.' ", "15": "So they threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them? ", "16": "He will come and put these tenants to death and will give the vineyard to others.\u201d When the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders heard this, they said, \u201cMay it never be!\u201d ", "17": "But Jesus looked at them and said, \u201cWhat then is [the meaning of] this that is written: 'The [very] Stone which the builders rejected, this became the chief Cornerstone'?", "18": "Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken and shattered in pieces; and on whomever it falls, it will crush him.\u201d", "19": "The scribes and the chief priests tried to [find a way to] arrest Him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the people; because they understood that He spoke this parable against them.

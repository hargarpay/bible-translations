", "3": "He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little distance from the shore. And He sat down and began teaching the crowds from the boat. ", "4": "When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon [Peter], \u201cPut out into the deep water and lower your nets for a catch [of fish].\u201d ", "5": "Simon replied, \u201cMaster, we worked hard all night [to the point of exhaustion] and caught nothing [in our nets], but at Your word I will [do as you say and] lower the nets [again].\u201d ", "6": "When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were [at the point of] breaking; ", "7": "so they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats [with fish], so that they began to sink. ", "8": "But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, \u201cGo away from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!\u201d ", "9": "For he and all his companions were completely astounded at the catch of fish which they had taken; ", "10": "and so were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon [Peter]. Jesus said to Simon, \u201cHave no fear; from now on you will be catching men!\u201d ", "11": "After they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and [a]followed Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example].", "12": "While Jesus was in one of the cities, there came a man covered with [an advanced case of] leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, \u201cLord, if You are willing, You can make me clean and well.\u201d ", "13": "And Jesus reached out His hand and touched him, saying, \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d And immediately the leprosy left him. ", "14": "Jesus ordered him to tell no one [that he might happen to meet], \u201cBut go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your purification, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony (witness) to them [that this is a work of Messiah].\u201d ", "15": "But the news about Him was spreading farther, and large crowds kept gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their illnesses. ", "16": "But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray [in seclusion].", "17": "One day as He was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem.

", "20": "When Jesus saw their [active] faith [springing from confidence in Him], He said, \u201cMan, your sins are forgiven.\u201d ", "21": "The scribes and the Pharisees began to consider and question [the implications of what He had said], saying, \u201cWho is this man who speaks blasphemies [by claiming the rights and prerogatives of God]? Who can forgive sins [that is, remove guilt, nullify sin's penalty, and assign righteousness] except God alone?\u201d ", "22": "But Jesus, knowing their [hostile] thoughts, answered them, \u201cWhy are you questioning [these things] in your hearts?

", "26": "They were all astonished, and they began glorifying God; and they were filled with [reverential] fear and kept saying, \u201cWe have seen wonderful and incredible things today!\u201d", "27": "After this Jesus went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi (Matthew) sitting at the tax booth; and He said to him, \u201cFollow Me [as My disciple, accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d ", "28": "And he left everything behind and got up and began to follow Jesus [as His disciple].", "29": "Levi (Matthew) gave a great banquet for Him at his house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining at the table with them.

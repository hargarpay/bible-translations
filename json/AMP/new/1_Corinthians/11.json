{"1": "Imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.", "2": "I praise and appreciate you because you remember me in everything and you firmly hold to the [a]traditions [the substance of my instructions], just as I have passed them on to you. ", "3": "But I want you to understand that Christ is the head (authority over) of every man, and man is the head of woman, and God is the head of Christ. ", "4": "Every man who prays or [b]prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head [and the One who is his head]. ", "5": "And every woman who prays or prophesies when she has her [c]head uncovered disgraces her head; for she is one and the same as the [d]woman whose head is shaved [in disgrace]. ", "6": "If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and [e]if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head. ", "7": "A man ought not have his head covered [during worship], since he is the image and [reflected] glory of God; but the woman is [the expression of] man's glory. ", "8": "For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; ", "9": "for indeed man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man. ", "10": "Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, [f]for the sake of the angels [so as not to offend them]. ", "11": "Nevertheless, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. ", "12": "For as the woman originates from the man, so also man is born through the woman; and all things [whether male or female] originate from God [as their Creator]. ", "13": "[g]Judge for yourselves; is it proper for a woman to offer prayer to God [publicly] with her head uncovered? ", "14": "Does not common sense itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, ", "15": "but if a woman has long hair, it is her ornament and glory? For her long hair is given to her as a covering. ", "16": "Now if anyone is inclined to be contentious [about this], we have no other practice [in worship than this], nor do the churches of God [in general].", "17": "But in giving this next instruction, I do not praise you, because when you meet together it is not for the better but for the worse. ", "18": "For, in the first place, when you meet together in church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and in part I believe it, ", "19": "for [doubtless] there have to be factions among you, so that those who are of approved character may be clearly recognized among you. ", "20": "So when you meet together, it is not to eat the [h]Lord's Supper, ", "21": "for when you eat, each one hurries to get his own supper first [not waiting for others or the poor]. So one goes hungry while another gets drunk. ", "22": "What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those [impoverished believers] who have nothing? What will I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? In this I will not praise you!", "23": "[i]For I received from the Lord Himself that [instruction] which I passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which He was betrayed took bread; ", "24": "and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, \u201cThis is (represents) My body, which is [offered as a sacrifice] for you. Do this in [affectionate] remembrance of Me.\u201d ", "25": "In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant [ratified and established] in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in [affectionate] remembrance of Me.\u201d ", "26": "For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are [symbolically] proclaiming [the fact of] the Lord's death until He comes [again].", "27": "So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [of Him] will be guilty of [profaning and sinning against] the body and blood of the Lord. ", "28": "But a person must [prayerfully] examine himself [and his relationship to Christ], and only when he has done so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup. ", "29": "For anyone who eats and drinks [without solemn reverence and heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifice of Christ], eats and drinks a judgment on himself if he does not [j]recognize the body [of Christ]. ", "30": "That [careless and unworthy participation] is the reason why many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep [in death]. ", "31": "But if we evaluated and judged ourselves honestly [recognizing our shortcomings and correcting our behavior], we would not be judged. ", "32": "But when we [fall short and] are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined [by undergoing His correction] so that we will not be condemned [to eternal punishment] along with the world.", "33": "So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat [the Lord's Supper], wait for one another [and see to it that no one is left out]. ", "34": "If anyone is too hungry [to wait], let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment [on yourselves]. About the remaining matters [of which I was informed], I will take care of them when I come."}

", "4": "Let there be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse [obscene or vulgar] joking, because such things are not appropriate [for believers]; but instead speak of your thankfulness [to God]. ", "5": "For be sure of this: no immoral, impure, or greedy person\u2014for that one is [in effect] an idolater\u2014has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God [for such a person places a higher value on something other than God].", "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty arguments [that encourage you to sin], for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience [those who habitually sin].

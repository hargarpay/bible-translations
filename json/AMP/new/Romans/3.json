{"1": "Then what is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? ", "2": "Great in every respect. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [His very [a]words]. ", "3": "What then? If some did not believe or were unfaithful [to God], their lack of belief will not nullify and make invalid the faithfulness of God and His word, will it? ", "4": "Certainly not! Let God be found true [as He will be], though every person be found a liar, just as it is written [in Scripture], \u201cThat You may be justified in Your words, And prevail when You are judged [by sinful men].\u201d", "5": "But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God is not wrong to inflict His wrath [on us], is He? (I am speaking in purely human terms.) ", "6": "Certainly not! For otherwise, how will God judge the world? ", "7": "But [as you might say] if through my lie God's truth was magnified and abounded to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner? ", "8": "And why not say, (as some slanderously report and claim that we teach) \u201cLet us do evil so that good may come of it\u201d? Their condemnation [by God] is just.", "9": "Well then, are we [Jews] better off than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) are under the control of sin and subject to its power. ", "10": "As it is written and forever remains written, \u201cThere is none righteous [none that meets God's standard], not even one.", "11": "\u00a0 \u201cThere is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God.", "12": "\u00a0 \u201cAll have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, no, not one.\u201d", "13": "\u00a0 \u201cTheir throat is an open grave; They [habitually] deceive with their tongues.\u201d \u201cThe venom of asps is beneath their lips.\u201d", "14": "\u00a0 \u201cTheir mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.\u201d", "15": "\u00a0 \u201cTheir feet are swift to shed blood,", "16": "\u00a0 Destruction and misery are in their paths,", "17": "\u00a0 And they have not known the path of peace.\u201d", "18": "\u00a0 \u201cThere is no fear of God [and His awesome power] before their eyes.\u201d", "19": "Now we know that whatever the Law [of Moses] says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that [the excuses of] every mouth may be silenced [from protesting] and that all the world may be held accountable to God [and subject to His judgment]. ", "20": "For no [b]person will be justified [freed of guilt and declared righteous] in His sight by [trying to do] the works of the Law. For through the Law we become conscious of sin [and the recognition of sin directs us toward repentance, but provides no remedy for sin].", "21": "But now the righteousness of God has been clearly revealed [independently and completely] apart from the Law, though it is [actually] confirmed by the Law and the [words and writings of the] Prophets. ", "22": "This righteousness of God comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all those [Jew or Gentile] who believe [and trust in Him and acknowledge Him as God's Son]. There is no distinction, ", "23": "since all have sinned and continually fall short of the glory of God, ", "24": "and are being justified [declared free of the guilt of sin, made acceptable to God, and granted eternal life] as a gift by His [precious, undeserved] [c]grace, through the redemption [the payment for our sin] which is [provided] in Christ Jesus, ", "25": "whom God displayed publicly [before the eyes of the world] as a [life-giving] [d]sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation (propitiation) by His blood [to be received] through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness [which demands punishment for sin], because in His forbearance [His deliberate restraint] He passed over the sins previously committed [before Jesus' crucifixion]. ", "26": "It was to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the One who justifies those who have faith in Jesus [and rely confidently on Him as Savior].", "27": "Then what becomes of [our] boasting? It is excluded [entirely ruled out, banished]. On what principle? On [the principle of good] works? No, but on the principle of faith. ", "28": "For we maintain that an individual is justified by faith distinctly apart from works of the Law [the observance of which has nothing to do with justification, that is, being declared free of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God]. ", "29": "Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not also the God of Gentiles [who were not given the Law]? Yes, of Gentiles also, ", "30": "since indeed it is one [and the same] God who will justify the circumcised by faith [which began with Abraham] and the uncircumcised through [their newly acquired] faith.", "31": "Do we then nullify the Law by this faith [making the Law of no effect, overthrowing it]? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm and establish and uphold the Law [since it convicts us all of sin, pointing to the need for salvation]."}

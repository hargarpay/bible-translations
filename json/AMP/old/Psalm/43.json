{"1": "Judge and vindicate me, O God; plead my case against an ungodly nation. O rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man!", "2": "\u00a0 For You are the God of my strength [my stronghold\u2014in whom I take refuge]; why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?", "3": "\u00a0 O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.", "4": "\u00a0 Then I will go to the altar of God, To God, my exceeding joy; With the lyre I will praise You, O God, my God!", "5": "\u00a0 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you restless and disturbed within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall again praise Him, The [a]help of my [sad] countenance and my God."}

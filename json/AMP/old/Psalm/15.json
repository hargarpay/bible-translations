{"1": "O Lord, who may lodge [as a guest] in Your tent? Who may dwell [continually] on Your holy hill?", "2": "\u00a0 He who walks with integrity and strength of character, and works righteousness, And speaks and holds truth in his heart.", "3": "\u00a0 He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;", "4": "\u00a0 In his eyes an evil person is despised, But he honors those who fear the Lord [and obediently worship Him with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder]. He keeps his word even to his own disadvantage and does not change it [for his own benefit];", "5": "\u00a0 He does not put out his money at interest [to a fellow Israelite], And does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken."}

And their own shepherds have no pity on them nor protect them [from the wolves]. ", "6": "For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u201d declares the Lord; \u201cbut behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into the hand of another and into the hands of his [foreign] king. And the enemy will strike the land, and I will not rescue the people from their hand.\u201d", "7": "So I [Zechariah] pastured the flock doomed for slaughter, truly [as the name implies] the most miserable of sheep. And I took two [shepherd's] staffs, the one I called Favor (Grace) and the other I called Union (Bonds); so I pastured the flock. ", "8": "Then I eliminated the three [incompetent, unfit] shepherds [the civil rulers, the priests, and the prophets] in one month, for I was impatient with them, and they also were tired of me and despised me.

", "14": "Then I broke my second staff, Union, into pieces to break the brotherhood between Judah (the Southern Kingdom) and Israel (the Northern Kingdom).", "15": "The Lord said to me, \u201cTake again for yourself the equipment [of a shepherd, but this time] of a foolish shepherd. ", "16": "For behold, I am going to raise up a [false] shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or feed the healthy; but will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs [to consume everything].", "17": "\u00a0 \u201cWoe (judgment is coming) to the worthless and foolish shepherd Who deserts the flock!

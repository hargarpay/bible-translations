Now hear me, I will pray to the Lord your God in accordance with your words; and I will declare to you whatever message the Lord answers; I will keep nothing back from you.\u201d ", "5": "Then they said to Jeremiah, \u201cMay the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we fail to act in accordance with all the things that the Lord your God sends you to tell us.

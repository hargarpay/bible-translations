{"1": "Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word (command) of the Lord, while Jeroboam was standing by the altar [which he had built] to burn incense. ", "2": "The man cried out against the [idolatrous] altar by the word of the Lord, \u201cO altar, altar, thus says the Lord: 'Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, [a]Josiah by name; and on you shall he sacrifice [the bodies of] the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.'\u201d ", "3": "And he gave a sign the same day, saying, \u201cThis is the sign which the Lord has spoken: 'Behold, the altar shall be split apart and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.'\u201d ", "4": "When the king heard the words which the man of God cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, \u201cSeize him!\u201d And his hand which he had put out against him withered, so that he was unable to pull it back to himself.

", "7": "And the king said to the man of God, \u201cCome home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.\u201d ", "8": "But the man of God said to the king, \u201cEven if you were to give me half your house (wealth), I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.

So they came and told about it in the city [of Bethel] where the old prophet lived.", "26": "When the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard about it, he said, \u201cIt is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the Lord; therefore the Lord has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, in accordance with the word of the Lord which He spoke to him.\u201d ", "27": "And he said to his sons, \u201cSaddle the donkey for me.\u201d And they saddled it.

He ordained anyone who was willing, so that there would be priests for the high places.

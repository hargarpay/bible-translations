{"1": "In the second year (604 b.c.) of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams which troubled and disturbed his spirit and [interfered with] his ability to sleep. ", "2": "Then the king gave a command to call the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the [a]Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. ", "3": "The king said to them, \u201cI had a dream, and my spirit is troubled and anxious to know the [content and meaning of the] dream.\u201d", "4": "Then the Chaldeans said to the king in [b]Aramaic, \u201cO king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.\u201d ", "5": "The king replied to the Chaldeans, \u201cMy command is firm and unchangeable: if you do not reveal to me the [content of the] dream along with its interpretation, you shall be cut into pieces and your houses shall be made a heap of rubbish. ", "6": "But if you tell [me] the [content of the] dream along with its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.\u201d ", "7": "They answered again, \u201cLet the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will explain its interpretation [to you].\u201d ", "8": "The king replied, \u201cI know for certain that you are bargaining for time, because you have seen that my command [to you] is firm and irrevocable. ", "9": "If you will not reveal to me the [content of the] dream, there is but one sentence for you; for you have [already] prepared lying and corrupt words [and you have agreed together] to speak [them] before me [hoping to delay your execution] until the situation is changed. Therefore, tell me the dream [first], and then I will know [with confidence] that you can give me its interpretation.\u201d ", "10": "The Chaldeans answered the king and said, \u201cThere is not a man on earth who can tell the king this matter, for no king, lord or ruler has ever asked such a thing as this of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. ", "11": "Furthermore, what the king demands is an unusual and difficult thing indeed! No one except the gods can reveal it to the king, and their dwelling is not with [mortal] flesh.\u201d", "12": "Because of this the king was indignant and extremely furious and gave a command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

", "16": "So Daniel went in and asked the king to appoint a date and give him time, so that he might reveal to the king the interpretation of the dream.", "17": "Then Daniel returned to his house and discussed the matter with Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, ", "18": "in order that they might seek compassion from the God of heaven regarding this secret, so that Daniel and his companions would not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.", "19": "Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

Bring me before the king, and I will reveal to the king the interpretation [of his dream].\u201d", "25": "Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel before the king and said this to him: \u201cI have found a man among the exiles of Judah who can explain to the king the interpretation [of the dream].\u201d ", "26": "The king said to Daniel, whose [Babylonian] name was Belteshazzar, \u201cAre you able to reveal to me the [content of the] dream which I have seen and its interpretation?\u201d ", "27": "Daniel answered the king and said, \u201cRegarding the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither the wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers are able to answer the king, ", "28": "but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days (end of days). This was your dream and the vision [that appeared] in your mind while on your bed.

", "30": "But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because my wisdom is greater than that of any other living man, but in order to make the interpretation known to the king, and so that you may understand [fully] the thoughts of your mind.", "31": "\u201cYou, O king, were looking, and behold, [there was] a single great statue; this image, which was large and of unsurpassed splendor, stood before you, and its appearance was awesome and terrifying. ", "32": "As for this [d]statue, its head was made of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, ", "33": "its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay [pottery]. ", "34": "As you were looking, a [e]stone was cut out without [human] hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. ", "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found. And the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.", "36": "\u201cThis was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.

You [king of Babylon] are the head of gold.", "39": "After you will arise another kingdom (Medo-Persia) inferior to you, and then a third kingdom of bronze (Greece under Alexander the Great), which will rule over all the earth.", "40": "Then a fourth kingdom (Rome) will be strong as iron, for iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things; and like iron which crushes things in pieces, it will break and crush all these [others]. ", "41": "And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it some of the durability and strength of iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with common clay. ", "42": "As the [ten] toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so some of the kingdom will be strong, and another part of it will be brittle. ", "43": "And as you saw the iron mixed with common clay, so they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not merge [for such diverse things or ideologies cannot unite], even as iron does not mix with clay.", "44": "In the days of those [final ten] kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left for another people; but it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.

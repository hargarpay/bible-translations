{"1": "Nebuchadnezzar the king made a [a]gold [-plated] image, whose height [including the pedestal] was sixty cubits (ninety feet) and its width six cubits (nine feet). He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. ", "2": "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the [b]satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and lawyers and all the chief officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. ", "3": "Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and lawyers, and all the chief officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before it. ", "4": "Then the herald loudly proclaimed, \u201cYou are commanded, O peoples, nations, and speakers of every language, ", "5": "that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon (four-stringed harp), dulcimer, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. ", "6": "Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.\u201d ", "7": "So when the people heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, dulcimer, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and speakers of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.", "8": "At that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought [malicious] accusations against the Jews. ", "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, \u201cO king, live forever! ", "10": "You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer, bagpipe, and all kinds of music is to fall down and worship the golden image. ", "11": "Whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. ", "12": "There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.\u201d", "13": "Then Nebuchadnezzar in a furious rage gave a command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; and these men were brought before the king. ", "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \u201cIs it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up? ", "15": "Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, very good. But if you do not worship, you shall be thrown at once into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can rescue you out of my hands?\u201d", "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered the king, \u201cO Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to answer you on this point. ", "17": "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and He will rescue us from your hand, O king. ", "18": "But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up!\u201d", "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and his facial expression changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then he gave a command that the furnace was to be heated seven [c]times hotter than usual. ", "20": "He commanded certain strong men in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. ", "21": "Then these [three] men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their turbans, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. ", "22": "Because the king's command was urgent and the furnace was extremely hot, the flame of the fire killed the men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. ", "23": "But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up.", "24": "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king [looked and] was astounded, and he jumped up and said to his counselors, \u201cDid we not throw three men who were tied up into the midst of the fire?\u201d They replied to the king, \u201cCertainly, O king.\u201d ", "25": "He answered, \u201cLook! I see four men untied, walking around in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt! And the appearance of the fourth is like [d]a son of the gods!\u201d ", "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing furnace and said, \u201cShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, servants of the Most High God, come out [of there]! Come here!\u201d Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire. ", "27": "The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king's counselors gathered around them and saw that in regard to these men the fire had no effect on their bodies\u2014their hair was not singed, their clothes were not scorched or damaged, even the smell of smoke was not on them.", "28": "Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, \u201cBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and rescued His servants who believed in, trusted in, and relied on Him! They violated the king's command and surrendered their bodies rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. ", "29": "Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego shall be cut into pieces and their houses be made a heap of rubbish, for there is no other god who is able to save in this way!\u201d ", "30": "Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon."}

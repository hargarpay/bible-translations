He also ordered Ashpenaz to teach them the literature and language of the [e]Chaldeans. ", "5": "The king assigned a daily ration for them from his finest food and from the wine which he drank. They were to be educated and nourished this way for three years so that at the end of that time they were [prepared] to enter the king's service.

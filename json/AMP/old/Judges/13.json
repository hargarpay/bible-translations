{"1": "Now Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.", "2": "And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was infertile and had no children. ", "3": "And the [a]Angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, \u201cBehold, you are infertile and have no children, but you shall conceive and give birth to a son. ", "4": "Therefore, be careful not to drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, and do not eat anything [ceremonially] unclean. ", "5": "For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a [b]Nazirite [dedicated] to God from birth; and he shall begin to rescue Israel from the hands of the Philistines.\u201d ", "6": "Then the woman went and told her husband, saying, \u201cA Man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the Angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask Him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name. ", "7": "But He said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, nor eat anything [ceremonially] unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.'\u201d", "8": "Then Manoah pleaded with the Lord and said, \u201cO Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do for the boy who is to be born.\u201d ", "9": "And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. ", "10": "So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, \u201cBehold, the Man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.\u201d ", "11": "Then Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the Man and said to him, \u201cAre you the Man who spoke to this woman?\u201d He said, \u201cI am.\u201d ", "12": "And Manoah said, \u201cNow when your words come true, what shall be the boy's manner of life, and his vocation?\u201d ", "13": "The Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, \u201cThe woman must pay attention to everything that I said to her. ", "14": "She may not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, nor eat anything [ceremonially] unclean. She shall observe everything that I commanded her.\u201d", "15": "Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, \u201cPlease let us detain you and let us prepare a young goat for you [to eat].\u201d ", "16": "The Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, \u201cThough you detain me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord.\u201d For Manoah did not know that he was the Angel of the Lord.

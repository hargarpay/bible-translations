{"1": "But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat [as a gift of reconciliation]; and he said, \u201cI will go in to my wife in her room.\u201d But her father would not allow him to go in. ", "2": "Her father said, \u201cI really thought you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Is her younger sister not more beautiful than she? Please take her [as your wife] instead.\u201d ", "3": "Samson said to them, \u201cThis time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.\u201d ", "4": "So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches and turning the foxes tail to tail, he put a torch between each pair of tails. ", "5": "When he had set the torches ablaze, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and he burned up the heap of sheaves and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and olive groves. ", "6": "Then the Philistines said, \u201cWho did this?\u201d And they were told, \u201cSamson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took Samson's wife and gave her to his [chief] companion [at the wedding feast].\u201d So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. ", "7": "Samson said to them, \u201cIf this is the way you act, be certain that I will take revenge on you, and [only] after that I will stop.\u201d ", "8": "Then he struck them [a]without mercy, a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.", "9": "Then the [army of the] Philistines came up and camped in [the tribal territory of] Judah, and overran Lehi (Jawbone). ", "10": "The men of Judah said, \u201cWhy have you come up against us?\u201d And they answered, \u201cWe have come up to bind Samson, in order to do to him as he has done to us.\u201d ", "11": "Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, \u201cHave you not known that the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that you have done to us?\u201d He said to them, \u201cAs they did to me, so I have done to them.\u201d ", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWe have come down to bind you, so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.\u201d And Samson said to them, \u201cSwear to me that you will not [b]kill me.\u201d ", "13": "So they said to him, \u201cNo, we will [only] bind you securely and place you into their hands; but we certainly will not kill you.\u201d So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock [of Etam].", "14": "When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him mightily, and the ropes on his arms were like flax (linen) that had been burned, and his bonds [c]dropped off his hands. ", "15": "He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out his hand and took it and killed a thousand men with it. ", "16": "Then Samson said, \u201cWith the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck down a thousand men.\u201d", "17": "When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi (hill of the jawbone). ", "18": "Then Samson was very thirsty, and he called out to the Lord and said, \u201cYou have given this great victory through the hand of Your servant, and now am I to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised (pagans)?\u201d ", "19": "So God split open the hollow place that was at Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his spirit (strength) returned and he was revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore (spring which is calling), which is at Lehi to this day. ", "20": "And Samson judged Israel in the days of [occupation by] the Philistines for twenty years."}

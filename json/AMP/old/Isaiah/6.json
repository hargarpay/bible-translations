", "2": "Above Him seraphim (heavenly beings) stood; each one had six wings: with two wings he covered his face, with two wings he covered his feet, and with two wings he flew. ", "3": "And one called out to another, saying, \u201cHoly, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts; The whole earth is filled with His glory.\u201d", "4": "And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, and the temple was filling with smoke. ", "5": "Then I said, \u201cWoe is me! For I am ruined, Because I am a man of [ceremonially] unclean lips, And I live among a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\u201d", "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. ", "7": "He touched my mouth with it and said, \u201cListen carefully, this has touched your lips; your wickedness [your sin, your injustice, your wrongdoing] is taken away and your sin atoned for and forgiven.\u201d", "8": "Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\u201d Then I said, \u201cHere am I.

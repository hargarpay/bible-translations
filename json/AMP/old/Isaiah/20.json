", "3": "And the Lord said, \u201cEven as My servant Isaiah has walked [c]stripped and barefoot for three years as a sign and forewarning concerning Egypt and Cush (Ethiopia), ", "4": "in the same way the king of Assyria will lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, young and old, stripped and barefoot, even with buttocks uncovered\u2014to the [d]shame of Egypt. ", "5": "Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast. ", "6": "So the inhabitants of this coastland [the Israelites and their neighbors] will say in that day, 'Look what has happened to those in whom we hoped and trusted and to whom we fled for help to be spared from the king of Assyria! But we, how will we escape [captivity and exile]?'\u201d"}

So they will be called the trees of righteousness [strong and magnificent, distinguished for integrity, justice, and right standing with God], The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.", "4": "\u00a0 Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins, They will raise up and restore the former desolations; And they will renew the ruined cities, The desolations (deserted settlements) of many generations.", "5": "\u00a0 Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.", "6": "\u00a0 But you shall be called the priests of the Lord; People will speak of you as the ministers of our God.

Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba; Everyone's head is shaved, and every beard is cut off [in mourning].", "3": "\u00a0 In their streets they have wrapped themselves with sackcloth; On their [flat] housetops and in their open squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.", "4": "\u00a0 Heshbon and Elealeh [cities claimed by Moab] cry out; Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out; Moab's soul trembles within him.", "5": "\u00a0 My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are [fleeing] as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah.

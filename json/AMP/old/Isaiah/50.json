In fact, You were sold for your wickedness [your sin, your injustice, your wrongdoing], And for your transgressions your mother was sent away.", "2": "\u00a0 \u201cWhy, when I came, was there no man [to greet Me]? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Is My hand really so short that it cannot redeem [My servants]? Or have I no power to rescue? Listen carefully, with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers into a desert; Their fish stink because there is no water And die of thirst.", "3": "\u00a0 \u201cI clothe the heavens with the blackness [of storm clouds] And make sackcloth [of mourning] their clothing.\u201d", "4": "\u00a0 The Lord God has given Me [His [b]Servant] the tongue of disciples [as One who is taught], That I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.

Indeed, they will all wear out like a garment; The moth will eat them.", "10": "\u00a0 Who is among you who fears the Lord, Who obeys the voice of His Servant, Yet who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust and be confident in the name of the Lord and let him rely on his God.", "11": "\u00a0 Listen carefully, all you who kindle your own fire [devising your own man-made plan of salvation], Who surround yourselves with torches, Walk by the light of your [self-made] fire And among the torches that you have set ablaze. But this you will have from My hand: You will lie down in [a place of] torment."}

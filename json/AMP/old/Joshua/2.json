", "2": "Now the king of Jericho was told, \u201cBehold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to spy and search out the land.\u201d ", "3": "So the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, \u201cBring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, because they have come [as spies] to search out all the land.\u201d ", "4": "But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; so she said, \u201cYes, two men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. ", "5": "When it was time to close the [city] gate at dark, the men left; I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly, for [if you do] you will overtake them.\u201d ", "6": "But [in fact] she had brought the scouts up to the roof and had hidden them under the [b]stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof [to dry].

{"1": "Then Samuel said to all Israel, \u201cBehold, I have listened to your voice in everything that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you. ", "2": "And now, here is the king walking before you. As for me, I am old and gray, and here are my sons with you. I have walked before you from my childhood to this day. ", "3": "Here I am; testify against me before the Lord and [Saul] His anointed [if I have done someone wrong]. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes [to the truth]? [Tell me and] I will restore it to you.\u201d ", "4": "They said, \u201cYou have not exploited us or oppressed us or taken anything at all from a man's hand.\u201d ", "5": "Samuel said to them, \u201cThe Lord is a witness against you, and [Saul] His anointed is a witness this day that you have not found anything in my hand.\u201d And they answered, \u201cHe is a witness.\u201d", "6": "Then Samuel said to the people, \u201cIt is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers (ancestors) up from the land of Egypt. ", "7": "Now then, take your stand, so that I may plead and contend with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord which He did for you and for your fathers. ", "8": "When Jacob [and his sons] had come into Egypt [and later when the Egyptians oppressed them] and your [a]fathers cried out to the Lord, then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place. ", "9": "But when they forgot the Lord their God, He sold them into the hand of [b]Sisera, commander of Hazor's army, and into the hand of the Philistines and of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. ", "10": "They cried out to the Lord, saying, 'We have sinned because we have abandoned (rejected) the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now rescue us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.' ", "11": "Then the Lord sent Jerubbaal (Gideon) and [c]Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and He rescued you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in security.", "12": "But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites had come against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us'\u2014although the Lord your God was your King. ", "13": "Now therefore, here is [Saul] the king whom you have chosen, and for whom you asked; behold, the Lord has set a king over you. ", "14": "If you will fear the Lord [with awe and profound reverence] and serve Him and listen to His voice and not rebel against His commandment, then both you and your king will follow the Lord your God [and it will be well]. ", "15": "But if you do not listen to the Lord's voice, but rebel against His [d]command, then the hand of the Lord will be against you [to punish you], as it was against your fathers. ", "16": "So now, take your stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes. ", "17": "Is it not [the beginning of the] wheat harvest today? I will call to the Lord and He will send thunder and rain; then you will know [without any doubt], and see that your evil which you have done is great in the sight of the Lord by asking for yourselves a king.\u201d ", "18": "So Samuel called to the Lord [in prayer], and He sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.", "19": "Then all the people said to Samuel, \u201cPray to the Lord your God for your servants, [e]so that we will not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil\u2014to ask for a king for ourselves.\u201d ", "20": "Samuel said to the people, \u201cDo not be afraid. You have [indeed] done all this evil; yet do not turn away from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart. ", "21": "You must not turn away, for then you would go after futile things which cannot profit or rescue, because they are futile. ", "22": "The Lord will not abandon His people for His great name's sake, because the Lord has been pleased to make you a people for Himself. ", "23": "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way. ", "24": "Only fear the Lord [with awe and profound reverence] and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you. ", "25": "But if you still do evil, both you and your king will be swept away [to destruction].\u201d"}

", "3": "As for me, I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you, and if I learn anything, then I will tell you.\u201d ", "4": "Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, \u201cMay the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you. ", "5": "For he took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the Lord brought about a great victory for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced.

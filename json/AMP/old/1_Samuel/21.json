{"1": "Then David went to [a]Nob to [b]Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling [in fear] to meet David and said to him, \u201cWhy are you alone, and no one with you?\u201d ", "2": "David said to Ahimelech the priest, \u201cThe king has commissioned me with a matter and has told me, 'Let no one know anything about the matter for which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you. I have directed the young men to a certain place.' ", "3": "Now what [food] do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.\u201d ", "4": "The priest answered David, \u201cThere is no ordinary (unconsecrated) bread on hand, but there is [c]consecrated bread; [you may have it] if only the young men have kept themselves from women.\u201d ", "5": "David answered the priest, \u201cBe assured that [d]women have been kept from us in these three days since I set out, and the [e]bodies of the young men were consecrated (ceremonially clean), although it was an ordinary (unconsecrated) journey; so how much more will their vessels be holy today?\u201d ", "6": "So the priest gave him the consecrated bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the [f]Presence which was removed from before the Lord in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away.", "7": "Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.", "8": "David said to Ahimelech, \u201cDo you not have a sword or spear here on hand?

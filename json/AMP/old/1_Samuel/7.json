", "2": "And from that day the ark remained in Kiriath-jearim for a very long time, for it was twenty years [until the reign of King David]; and all the house of Israel lamented (wailed) and grieved after the Lord.", "3": "Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, \u201cIf you are returning to the Lord with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth (pagan goddesses) from among you and direct your hearts to the Lord and serve Him only; and He will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines.\u201d ", "4": "So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the Lord alone.", "5": "Samuel said, \u201cGather all Israel together at Mizpah and I will pray to the Lord for you.\u201d ", "6": "So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day and said there, \u201cWe have sinned against the Lord.\u201d And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah.", "7": "Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the lords (governors) of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

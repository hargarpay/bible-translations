{"1": "There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the [a]hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an [b]Ephraimite. ", "2": "He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.", "3": "This man went up from his city [c]each year to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh. Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests to the Lord there. ", "4": "When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions [of the sacrificial meat] to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and daughters. ", "5": "But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the Lord had [d]given her no children. ", "6": "Hannah's rival provoked her bitterly, to irritate and embarrass her, because the Lord had [e]left her childless. ", "7": "So it happened year after year, whenever she went up to the house of the Lord, Peninnah provoked her; so she wept and would not eat. ", "8": "Then Elkanah her husband said to her, \u201cHannah, why do you cry and why do you not eat? Why are you so sad and discontent? Am I not better to you than ten sons?\u201d", "9": "So Hannah got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside the doorpost of the temple (tabernacle) of the Lord. ", "10": "Hannah was [f]greatly distressed, and she prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish. ", "11": "She made a vow, saying, \u201cO Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction (suffering) of Your maidservant and remember, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life; a [g]razor shall never touch his head.\u201d", "12": "Now it happened as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli was watching her mouth. ", "13": "Hannah was speaking in her heart (mind); only her lips were moving, and her voice was not heard, so Eli [h]thought she was drunk. ", "14": "Eli said to her, \u201cHow long will you make yourself drunk? Get rid of your wine.\u201d ", "15": "But Hannah answered, \u201cNo, my lord, I am a woman with a despairing spirit. I have not been drinking wine or any intoxicating drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord. ", "16": "Do not regard your maidservant as a wicked and worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and [bitter] provocation.\u201d ", "17": "Then Eli answered and said, \u201cGo in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.\u201d ", "18": "Hannah said, \u201cLet your maidservant find grace and favor in your sight.\u201d So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.", "19": "The family got up early the next morning, worshiped before the Lord, and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her [prayer]. ", "20": "It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; she named him [i]Samuel, saying, \u201cBecause I have asked for him from the Lord.\u201d", "21": "Then the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the Lord the [j]yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. ", "22": "But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, \u201cI will not go up until the child is [k]weaned; and then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the Lord and remain there as long as he lives.\u201d ", "23": "Elkanah her husband said to her, \u201cDo what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish and confirm His word.\u201d So the woman remained [behind] and nursed her son until she weaned him. ", "24": "Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a [l]leather bottle of wine [to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet fragrance], and she brought Samuel to the Lord's house in Shiloh, although the child was young. ", "25": "Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the child to Eli. ", "26": "Hannah said, \u201cOh, my lord! As [surely as] your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you here, praying to the Lord. ", "27": "For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my request which I asked of Him. ", "28": "Therefore I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.\u201d And they worshiped the Lord there."}

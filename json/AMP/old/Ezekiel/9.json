They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.", "3": "Then the [[b]Shekinah] glory and brilliance of the God of Israel (the cloud) [c]went up from the cherubim on which it had rested, to [stand above] the threshold of the [Lord's] temple. And the Lord called to the man clothed with linen, who had the scribe's writing case at his side. ", "4": "The Lord said to him, \u201cGo through the midst of the city, throughout all of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh [in distress] and grieve over all the repulsive acts which are being committed in it.\u201d ", "5": "But to the others I heard Him say, \u201cFollow him [the man with the scribe's writing case] throughout the city and strike; do not let your eyes have pity and do not spare [anyone].

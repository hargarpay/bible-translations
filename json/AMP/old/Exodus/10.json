{"1": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants [making them determined and unresponsive], so that I may exhibit My signs [of divine power] [a]among them, ", "2": "and that you may recount and explain in the hearing of your son, and your grandson, what I have done [repeatedly] to make a mockery of the Egyptians\u2014My signs [of divine power] which I have done among them\u2014so that you may know [without any doubt] and recognize [clearly] that I am the Lord.\u201d", "3": "So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, \u201cThus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. ", "4": "For if you refuse to let My people go, then hear this: tomorrow I will bring [migratory] locusts into your country. ", "5": "They shall cover the [visible] surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the ground, and they will eat the rest of what has remained\u2014that is, the vegetation left after the hail\u2014and they will eat every one of your trees that grows in the field; ", "6": "your houses and those of all your servants and of all the Egyptians shall be filled with locusts, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from their birth until this day.'\u201d Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. ", "7": "Pharaoh's servants said to him, \u201cHow long shall this man be a trap to us? Let the men go, so that they may serve the Lord their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?\u201d ", "8": "So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, \u201cGo, serve the Lord your God! Who specifically are the ones that are going?\u201d ", "9": "Moses said, \u201cWe will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds [all of us and all that we have], for we must hold a feast to the Lord.\u201d ", "10": "Pharaoh said to them, \u201cThe Lord be with you [to help you], if I ever let you go with your children [because you will never return]! Look [be forewarned], [b]you have an [c]evil plan in mind. ", "11": "No! Go now, you who are men, [without your families] and serve the Lord, if that is what you want.\u201d So Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh's presence.", "12": "Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cStretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat all the plants of the land, all that the hail has left.\u201d ", "13": "So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; when it was morning, the east wind had brought the [swarms of] locusts. ", "14": "The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down in the whole territory, a very dreadful mass of them; never before were there such locusts as these, nor will there ever be again.

There remained not a green thing on the trees or the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt. ", "16": "Then Pharaoh hurried to call for Moses and Aaron, and he said, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord your God and against you.

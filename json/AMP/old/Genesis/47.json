{"1": "Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, \u201cMy father and my brothers, with their flocks and their herds and all that they own, have come from the land of Canaan, and they are in the land of Goshen.\u201d ", "2": "He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. ", "3": "And Pharaoh said to his brothers [as Joseph expected], \u201cWhat is your occupation?\u201d And they said to Pharaoh, \u201cYour servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers [before us].\u201d ", "4": "Moreover, they said to Pharaoh, \u201cWe have come to live temporarily (sojourn) in the land [of Egypt], for there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants [in our land], for the famine is very severe in Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.\u201d ", "5": "Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, \u201cYour father and your brothers have come to you. ", "6": "The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know of any men of ability among them, [a]put them in charge of my livestock.\u201d", "7": "Then Joseph brought Jacob (Israel) his father and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. ", "8": "And Pharaoh asked Jacob, [b]\u201cHow old are you?\u201d ", "9": "Jacob said to Pharaoh, \u201cThe [c]years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. Few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, and they have [d]not reached the years that my fathers lived during the days of their pilgrimage.\u201d ", "10": "And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and departed from his presence. ", "11": "So Joseph settled his father and brothers and gave them a possession in Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses (Goshen), as Pharaoh commanded. ", "12": "Joseph provided and supplied his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to [the needs of] their children.", "13": "Now [in the course of time] there was no food in all the land, for the famine was distressingly severe, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan languished [in destitution and starvation] because of the famine. ", "14": "Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan [in payment] for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. ", "15": "And when the money was exhausted in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, \u201cGive us food! Why should we die before your very eyes? For our money is gone.\u201d ", "16": "Joseph said, \u201cGive up your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, since the money is gone.\u201d ", "17": "So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. ", "18": "When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, \u201cWe will not hide from my lord [the fact] that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of livestock; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. ", "19": "Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed [to plant], that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.\u201d", "20": "So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh's. ", "21": "And as for the people, he relocated them [temporarily] to cities from one end of Egypt's border to the other. ", "22": "Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived on the amount which Pharaoh gave them, so they did not sell their land. ", "23": "Then Joseph said to the people, \u201cLook, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, and you shall plant the land. ", "24": "At harvest time [when you reap the increase] you shall give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be your own to use for seed for the field and as food for you and those of your households and for your little ones.\u201d ", "25": "And they said, \u201cYou have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\u201d ", "26": "And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt\u2014valid to this [e]day\u2014that Pharaoh should have the fifth part [of the crops]; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's.", "27": "Now [the people of] Israel lived in the country of Egypt, in [the land of] Goshen, and they gained possessions and acquired property there and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. ", "28": "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the [f]length of Jacob's life was a hundred and forty-seven years.", "29": "And when the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, \u201cIf now I have found favor in your sight, [g]please put your hand under my thigh and [promise to] deal loyally and faithfully with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt, ", "30": "but when I lie down with my fathers [in death], you will carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place [at Hebron in the cave of Machpelah].\u201d And Joseph said, \u201cI will do as you have directed.\u201d ", "31": "Then he said, \u201cSwear to me [that you will do it].\u201d So he swore to him. Then Israel (Jacob) bowed in worship at the head of the bed."}

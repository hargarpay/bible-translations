{"1": "Now some time later, the cupbearer (butler) and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, Egypt's king. ", "2": "Pharaoh ([a]Sesostris II) was extremely angry with his two officials, the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers. ", "3": "He put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. ", "4": "The captain of the guard put Joseph in charge of them, and he served them; and they continued to be in custody for some time. ", "5": "Then the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both dreamed a dream in the same night, each man with his [own significant] dream and each dream with its [personal] interpretation. ", "6": "When Joseph came to them in the morning and looked at them, [he saw that] they were sad and depressed. ", "7": "So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in confinement with him in his master's house, \u201cWhy do you look so down-hearted today?\u201d ", "8": "And they said to him, \u201cWe have [each] dreamed [distinct] dreams and there is no one to interpret them.\u201d So Joseph said to them, \u201cDo not interpretations belong to God? Please tell me [your dreams].\u201d", "9": "So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, \u201cIn my dream there was a grapevine in front of me; ", "10": "and on the vine were three branches. Then as soon as it budded, its blossoms burst open, and its clusters produced ripe grapes [in rapid succession]. ", "11": "Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup; then I placed the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\u201d ", "12": "Then Joseph said to him, \u201cThis is the interpretation of it: the three branches represent three days; ", "13": "within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head (present you in public) and restore you to your position; and you will [again] put Pharaoh's cup into his hand just as [you did] when you were his cupbearer.

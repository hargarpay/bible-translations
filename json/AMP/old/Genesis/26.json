", "3": "Live temporarily [as a resident] in this land and I will be with you and will bless and favor you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish and carry out the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. ", "4": "I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of the heavens, and will give to your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, ", "5": "because Abraham listened to and obeyed My voice and [consistently] kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.\u201d", "6": "So Isaac stayed in Gerar. ", "7": "The men of the place asked him about his wife, and he said, \u201cShe is my [b]sister,\u201d for he was afraid to say, \u201cmy wife\u201d\u2014thinking, \u201cthe men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, since she is very beautiful.\u201d ", "8": "It happened when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac [c]caressing Rebekah his wife.

How did you [dare to] say to me, 'She is my sister'?\u201d And Isaac said to him, \u201cBecause I thought I might be killed because of her [desirability].\u201d ", "10": "Abimelech said, \u201cWhat is this that you have done to us? One of the men [among our people] might easily have been intimate with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us [before God].\u201d ", "11": "Then Abimelech commanded all his people, \u201cWhoever touches this man [Isaac] or his wife [Rebekah] shall without exception be put to death.\u201d", "12": "Then Isaac planted [seed] in that land [as a farmer] and reaped in the same year a hundred times [as much as he had planted], and the Lord blessed and favored him.

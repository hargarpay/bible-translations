Now Abel kept the flocks [of sheep and goats], but Cain cultivated the ground. ", "3": "And in the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground. ", "4": "But Abel brought [an offering of] the [finest] firstborn of his flock and the [b]fat portions. And the Lord had respect (regard) for Abel and for his offering; ", "5": "but for Cain and his offering He had no respect. So Cain became extremely angry (indignant), and [c]he looked annoyed and hostile. ", "6": "And the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you so angry? And why do you look annoyed? ", "7": "If you do well [believing Me and doing what is acceptable and pleasing to Me], will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well [but ignore My instruction], sin crouches at your door; its desire is for you [to overpower you], but you must master it.\u201d ", "8": "Cain talked with Abel his brother [about what God had said].

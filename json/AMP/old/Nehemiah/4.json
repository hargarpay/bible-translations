", "2": "He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, \u201cWhat are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of dust and rubbish, even the ones that have been burned?\u201d ", "3": "Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, \u201cEven what they are building\u2014if a fox should get up on it, he would break down their stone wall.\u201d", "4": "[And Nehemiah prayed] Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their taunts on their own heads. Give them up as prey in a land of captivity. ", "5": "Do not forgive their wrongdoing and do not let their sin be wiped out before You, for they have offended the builders [and provoked You].", "6": "So we built the wall and the entire wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a heart to work.", "7": "[b]But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches were being closed, they were very angry. ", "8": "They all conspired together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to cause a disturbance in it.", "9": "But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.", "10": "Then [the leaders of] Judah said, \u201cThe strength of the burden bearers is failing, And there is much rubble; We ourselves are unable To rebuild the wall.\u201d", "11": "Our enemies said, \u201cThey will not know or see us until we are among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.\u201d ", "12": "When the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times (repeatedly), \u201cFrom every place you turn, they will come up against us.\u201d ", "13": "So I stationed armed men behind the wall in the lowest places, at the open positions [where it was least protected]; and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows. ", "14": "When I saw their fear, I stood and said to the nobles and officials and the rest of the people: \u201cDo not be afraid of them; [confidently] remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and [with courage from Him] fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and for your homes.\u201d", "15": "Now when our enemies heard that we knew about their plot against us, and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each one to his work.

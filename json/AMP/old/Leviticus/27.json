{"1": "Again, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ", "2": "\u201cSpeak to the children of Israel and say to them, 'When a man makes a [a]special vow [consecrating himself or a member of his family], he shall be valued according to your [established system of] valuation of people belonging to the Lord [that is, the priest accepts from the man making the vow a specified amount of money for the temple treasury in place of the actual person]. ", "3": "If your valuation is of a male between twenty and sixty years of age, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. ", "4": "Or if the person is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. ", "5": "If the person is between five years and twenty years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels. ", "6": "But if the child is between one month and five years of age, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male and three shekels for the female. ", "7": "If the person is sixty years old and above, your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for the male, and ten shekels for the female. ", "8": "But if the person is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.", "9": "'Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the Lord, any such that one gives to the Lord shall be holy. ", "10": "He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; but if he does exchange an animal for an animal, then both the original offering and its substitute shall be holy. ", "11": "If it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the Lord, then he shall bring the animal before the priest, ", "12": "and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; it shall be as you, the priest, value it. ", "13": "But if he ever wishes to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation.", "14": "'If a man consecrates his house as sacred to the Lord, the priest shall appraise it as either good or bad; as the priest appraises it, so shall it stand. ", "15": "If the one who consecrates his house should wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his.", "16": "'And if a man consecrates to the Lord part of a field of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it; a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. ", "17": "If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, it shall stand according to your valuation. ", "18": "But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the price for him in proportion to the years that remain until the Year of Jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation. ", "19": "If the one who consecrates the field should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of the appraisal price to it, so that it may return to him. ", "20": "If he does not redeem the field, but has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed. ", "21": "When the field reverts in the Jubilee, the field shall be holy to the Lord, like a field set apart (devoted); the priest shall possess it as his property.

It is [already] the Lord's.

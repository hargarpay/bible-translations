", "2": "Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, as his father (ancestor) David had done. ", "3": "Instead he walked in the way of the [idolatrous] kings of Israel, and even made his son pass through the fire [as a human sacrifice], in accordance with the repulsive [and idolatrous] practices of the [pagan] nations whom the Lord drove out before the Israelites. ", "4": "He also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.", "5": "Then Rezin the king of Aram (Syria) and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome and conquer him. ", "6": "At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered [a]Elath [in Edom] for Aram, and drove the Jews away from it. The Arameans came to Elath, and live there to this day.", "7": "So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, \u201cI am your servant and son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the kings of Aram and of Israel, who are rising up against me.\u201d ", "8": "And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king's house, and sent a gift to the king of Assyria. ", "9": "So the king of Assyria listened to him; and he went up against Damascus and captured it, and carried its people away into exile to Kir, and put Rezin [king of Aram] to death.", "10": "Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser the king of Assyria, and saw the pagan altar which was at Damascus. Then King Ahaz sent a model of the altar to Urijah the priest along with a [detailed] pattern for all its construction. ", "11": "So Urijah the priest built an altar; in accordance with everything that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, that is how Urijah the priest made it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus. ", "12": "When the king came from Damascus, he saw the altar; then the king approached the altar and offered [sacrifices] on it, ", "13": "and burned his burnt offering and his grain offering, and poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. ", "14": "He brought the bronze altar, which was before the Lord, from the front of the house (temple), from between the [new] altar and the house of the Lord, and put it on the north side of the [new] altar.

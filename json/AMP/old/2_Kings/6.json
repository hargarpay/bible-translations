{"1": "Now the [a]sons of the prophets said to Elisha, \u201cLook now, the place where we [b]live near you is too small for us. ", "2": "Please let us go to the Jordan [River] and let each man take from there a beam [for the building]; and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live.\u201d And he answered, \u201cGo.\u201d ", "3": "Then one said, \u201cPlease be willing to go with your servants.\u201d So he answered, \u201cI shall go.\u201d ", "4": "So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down [some of] the trees. ", "5": "But it happened that as one was cutting down a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, \u201cOh no, my master! It was borrowed!\u201d ", "6": "The man of God said, \u201cWhere did it fall?\u201d When he showed him the place, Elisha cut off a stick and threw it in there, and made the iron [axe head] float. ", "7": "He said, \u201cPick it up for yourself.\u201d So he reached out with his hand and took it.", "8": "Now the king of Aram (Syria) was making war against Israel, and he consulted with his servants, saying, \u201cMy camp shall be in such and such a place.\u201d ", "9": "The man of God sent word to the king of Israel saying, \u201cBe careful not to pass by this place, because the Arameans are pulling back to there.\u201d ", "10": "Then the king of Israel sent word to the place about which Elisha had warned him; so he guarded himself there repeatedly.", "11": "Now the heart of the king of Aram (Syria) was enraged over this thing. He called his servants and said to them, \u201cWill you not tell me which of us is helping the king of Israel?\u201d ", "12": "One of his servants said, \u201cNone [of us is helping him], my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.\u201d ", "13": "So he said, \u201cGo and see where he is, so that I may send [men] and seize him.\u201d And he was told, \u201cHe is in Dothan.\u201d ", "14": "So he sent horses and chariots and a powerful army there. They came by night and surrounded the city.", "15": "The servant of the man of God got up early and went out, and behold, there was an army with horses and chariots encircling the city. Elisha's servant said to him, \u201cOh no, my master! What are we to do?\u201d ", "16": "Elisha answered, \u201cDo not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\u201d ", "17": "Then Elisha prayed and said, \u201cLord, please, open his eyes that he may see.\u201d And the Lord opened the servants eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire surrounding Elisha. ", "18": "When the Arameans came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, \u201cPlease strike this people (nation) with [c]blindness.\u201d And God struck them with blindness, in accordance with Elisha's request. ", "19": "Then Elisha said to the Arameans, \u201cThis is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me and I will lead you to the man whom you are seeking.\u201d And he led them to Samaria.", "20": "When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, \u201cLord, open the eyes of these men, so that they may see.\u201d And the Lord opened their eyes and they saw. Behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. ", "21": "When the king of Israel (Jehoram) saw them, he said to Elisha, \u201cMy father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?\u201d ", "22": "Elisha answered, \u201cYou shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and bow? Serve them bread and water, so that they may eat and drink, and go back to their master [King Ben-hadad].\u201d ", "23": "So the king prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Aram did not come into the land of Israel again.", "24": "But it came about after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram (Syria) gathered his whole army together and went up and besieged Samaria. ", "25": "Now there was a great famine in Samaria; and they [d]besieged it until a [e]donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a [f]kab of [g]dove's dung for five shekels of silver. ", "26": "As the king of Israel (Jehoram) was passing by on the [city] wall a woman cried out to him, \u201cHelp, my lord, O king!\u201d ", "27": "He said, \u201cIf the Lord does not help you, from where shall I get you help? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?\u201d ", "28": "And the king said to her, \u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d She answered, \u201cThis woman said to me, 'Give your son so we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.' ", "29": "So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give your son so that we may eat him'; but she had hidden her son.\u201d ", "30": "When the king heard the woman's words, he [h]tore his clothes\u2014now he was still walking along on the wall\u2014and the people looked [at him], and he had on [i]sackcloth underneath [his royal robe] next to his skin. ", "31": "Then he said, \u201c[j]May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!\u201d", "32": "Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man ahead of him [to behead Elisha]; but before the messenger arrived, Elisha told the elders, \u201cDo you see how this son of [Jezebel] a murderer has sent [a man] to remove my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it securely against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet [just] behind him?\u201d ", "33": "While Elisha was still talking with them, the messenger came down to him [followed by the king] and the king said, \u201cThis evil [situation] is from the Lord! Why should I wait for [help from] the Lord any longer?\u201d"}

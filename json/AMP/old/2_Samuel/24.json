So they went from the king's presence to take a census of the people of Israel. ", "5": "They crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the south side of the city which is in the middle of the river valley [of the Arnon] toward Gad, and on toward Jazer. ", "6": "Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon, ", "7": "and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba.

", "9": "And Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.", "10": "But David's heart (conscience) troubled him after he had counted the people. David said to the Lord, \u201cI have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O Lord, please take away the sin of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.\u201d ", "11": "When David got up in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, ", "12": "\u201cGo and say to David, 'Thus says the Lord, \u201cI am giving you three choices; select one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.\u201d'\u201d ", "13": "So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, \u201cShall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your enemies as they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence (plague) in your land? Now consider this and decide what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.\u201d ", "14": "Then David said to Gad, \u201cI am in great distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for His mercies are great, but do not let me fall into the hands of man.\u201d", "15": "So the Lord sent a pestilence (plague) [lasting three days] upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. ", "16": "When the [avenging] angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord relented from the disaster and said to the angel who destroyed the people, \u201cIt is enough! Now relax your hand.\u201d And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ", "17": "When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he spoke to the Lord and said, \u201cBehold, I [alone] am the one who has sinned and done wrong; but these sheep (people of Israel), what have they done [to deserve this]? Please let Your hand be [only] against me and my father's house (family).\u201d", "18": "Then Gad [the prophet] came to David that day and said to him, \u201cGo up, set up an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite [where you saw the angel].\u201d ", "19": "So David went up according to Gad's word, as the Lord commanded. ", "20": "Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and he went out and bowed before the king with his face toward the ground. ", "21": "Araunah said, \u201cWhy has my lord the king come to his servant?\u201d And David said, \u201cTo buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the Lord, so that the plague may be held back from the people.\u201d ", "22": "Araunah said to David, \u201cLet my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him. Look, here are oxen for the burnt offering, and threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. ", "23": "All of this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.\u201d And Araunah said to the king, \u201cMay the Lord your God be favorable to you.\u201d ", "24": "But the king said to Araunah, \u201cNo, but I will certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God which cost me nothing.\u201d So David purchased the [d]threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

So the Lord was moved [to compassion] by [David's] prayer for the land, and the plague was held back from Israel."}

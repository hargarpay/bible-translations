[c]Today I show loyalty and kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and his friends, by not having you handed over to David; and yet you charge me today with guilt concerning this woman.

Make your covenant (treaty) with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.\u201d ", "13": "David said, \u201cGood! I will make a covenant (treaty) with you, but I require one thing of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see [d]me.\u201d ", "14": "So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, \u201c[e]Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was [f]betrothed for [the price of] a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.\u201d ", "15": "So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish [to whom Saul had given her].

Then Abner told him, \u201cGo, return.\u201d And he did so.", "17": "Abner talked with the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel, saying, \u201cIn times past you were seeking for David to be king over you.

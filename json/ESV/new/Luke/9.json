And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.", "46": "An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.", "47": "But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side", "48": "and said to them, \u201cWhoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.\u201d", "49": "John answered, \u201cMaster, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.\u201d", "50": "But Jesus said to him, \u201cDo not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.\u201d", "51": "When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.", "52": "And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him.", "53": "But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem.", "54": "And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \u201cLord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\u201d[e]", "55": "But he turned and rebuked them.[f]", "56": "And they went on to another village.", "57": "As they were going along the road, someone said to him, \u201cI will follow you wherever you go.\u201d", "58": "And Jesus said to him, \u201cFoxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u201d", "59": "To another he said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d But he said, \u201cLord, let me first go and bury my father.\u201d", "60": "And Jesus[g] said to him, \u201cLeave the dead to bury their own dead.

You follow me!\u201d", "23": "So the saying spread abroad among the brothers[b] that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?\u201d", "24": "This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.", "25": "Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."}

Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud", "7": "and said to him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.", "8": "The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, \u201cIs this not the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d", "9": "Some said, \u201cIt is he.\u201d Others said, \u201cNo, but he is like him.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cI am the man.\u201d", "10": "So they said to him, \u201cThen how were your eyes opened?\u201d", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said, \u201cI do not know.\u201d", "13": "They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.", "14": "Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.", "15": "So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.\u201d", "16": "Some of the Pharisees said, \u201cThis man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\u201d But others said, \u201cHow can a man who is a sinner do such signs?\u201d And there was a division among them.", "17": "So they said again to the blind man, \u201cWhat do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?\u201d He said, \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d", "18": "The Jews[a] did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight", "19": "and asked them, \u201cIs this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\u201d", "20": "His parents answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son and that he was born blind.", "21": "But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.\u201d", "22": "(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus[b] to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.)", "23": "Therefore his parents said, \u201cHe is of age; ask him.\u201d", "24": "So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, \u201cGive glory to God.

One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.\u201d", "26": "They said to him, \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d", "27": "He answered them, \u201cI have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u201d", "28": "And they reviled him, saying, \u201cYou are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.", "29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.\u201d", "30": "The man answered, \u201cWhy, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.", "31": "We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.", "32": "Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.", "33": "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\u201d", "34": "They answered him, \u201cYou were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?\u201d And they cast him out.", "35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d[c]", "36": "He answered, \u201cAnd who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?\u201d", "37": "Jesus said to him, \u201cYou have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.\u201d", "38": "He said, \u201cLord, I believe,\u201d and he worshiped him.", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cFor judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.\u201d", "40": "Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, \u201cAre we also blind?\u201d", "41": "Jesus said to them, \u201cIf you were blind, you would have no guilt;[d] but now that you say, 'We see,' your guilt remains."}

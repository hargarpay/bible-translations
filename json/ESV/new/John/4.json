What you have said is true.\u201d", "19": "The woman said to him, \u201cSir, I perceive that you are a prophet.", "20": "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.\u201d", "21": "Jesus said to her, \u201cWoman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.", "22": "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.", "23": "But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.", "24": "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d", "25": "The woman said to him, \u201cI know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ).

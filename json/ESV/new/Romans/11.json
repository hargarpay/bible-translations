{"1": "I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,[a] a member of the tribe of Benjamin.", "2": "God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?", "3": "\u201cLord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.\u201d", "4": "But what is God's reply to him? \u201cI have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\u201d", "5": "So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.", "6": "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.", "7": "What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,", "8": "as it is written, \u201cGod gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.\u201d", "9": "And David says, \u201cLet their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;", "10": "let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever.\u201d", "11": "So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.", "12": "Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion[b] mean!", "13": "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry", "14": "in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.", "15": "For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?", "16": "If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.", "17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root[c] of the olive tree,", "18": "do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.", "19": "Then you will say, \u201cBranches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u201d", "20": "That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.", "21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.", "22": "Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.", "23": "And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.", "24": "For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.", "25": "Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers:[d] a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.", "26": "And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, \u201cThe Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob\u201d;", "27": "\u201cand this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\u201d", "28": "As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.", "29": "For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.", "30": "For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,", "31": "so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now[e] receive mercy.", "32": "For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.", "33": "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!", "34": "\u201cFor who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?\u201d", "35": "\u201cOr who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?\u201d", "36": "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen."}

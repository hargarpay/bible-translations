{"1": "After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he said, \u201cI will go in to my wife in the chamber.\u201d But her father would not allow him to go in.", "2": "And her father said, \u201cI really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.\u201d", "3": "And Samson said to them, \u201cThis time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm.\u201d", "4": "So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails.", "5": "And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards.", "6": "Then the Philistines said, \u201cWho has done this?\u201d And they said, \u201cSamson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.\u201d And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.", "7": "And Samson said to them, \u201cIf this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit.\u201d", "8": "And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.", "9": "Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi.", "10": "And the men of Judah said, \u201cWhy have you come up against us?\u201d They said, \u201cWe have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.\u201d", "11": "Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, \u201cDo you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?\u201d And he said to them, \u201cAs they did to me, so have I done to them.\u201d", "12": "And they said to him, \u201cWe have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.\u201d And Samson said to them, \u201cSwear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.\u201d", "13": "They said to him, \u201cNo; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you.\u201d So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.", "14": "When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.", "15": "And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men.", "16": "And Samson said, \u201cWith the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men.\u201d", "17": "As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.[a]", "18": "And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the Lord and said, \u201cYou have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?\u201d", "19": "And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore;[b] it is at Lehi to this day.", "20": "And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."}

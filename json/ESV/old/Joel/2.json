Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming; it is near,", "2": "a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations.", "3": "Fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns.

{"1": "The Sabbath day was past. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome came to the grave. They brought spices that smelled very nice to put on the body of Jesus.", "2": "They came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was very early in the morning. The sun was beginning to shine.", "3": "One woman said to the other, `Who will roll away the big stone from the grave for us?'", "4": "The stone was very big. When they looked up they saw that the stone was rolled away.", "5": "So they went in the grave. They saw a young man dressed in a white gown. He sat at the right side. They were very much surprised.", "6": "He said, `Do not be surprised. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was nailed to a cross. He is risen. He is not here. Look, here is where they laid him.", "7": "Go and tell his disciples and Peter. Tell them he is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there as he said to you.'", "8": "Then they left the grave quickly. They were trembling and afraid. They did not talk to anyone about it because they were afraid.", "9": "Jesus rose early on the first day of the week. He showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. Jesus had driven seven bad spirits out of her.", "10": "She went and told the disciples that she had seen him. They were still crying because Jesus was dead.", "11": "Mary told them that he was living. She had seen him. But they would not believe it.", "12": "After this, Jesus came to two disciples. He looked like a different person. They were walking out in the country.", "13": "They went back and told the rest of the disciples, but they would not believe them either.", "14": "Then after that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He said it was very bad for them not to believe and for their minds to be slow. He said they should have believed those who saw him after he rose from death.", "15": "Then Jesus said to them, `Go into every part of the world. Tell the good news to everyone.", "16": "The one who believes the good news and is baptised will be saved. But he who does not believe will be judged and punished.", "17": "These signs will be with those who believe. They will drive bad spirits out of people by using my name. They will speak new languages.", "18": "They will take up snakes. If they drink poison, it will not make them sick. They will put their hands on sick people and sick people will get well again.'", "19": "So after the Lord Jesus had talked to them, he went up into heaven and sat down beside God.", "20": "Then the disciples went and told the good news everywhere. The Lord worked with them. He made their words come true by the signs that happened after they talked."}

He taught them as he always did.", "2": "The Pharisees came to him and asked, `Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him?' They asked this to test Jesus.", "3": "Jesus answered, `What law did Moses give you?'", "4": "They said, `Moses allowed a man to write a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.'", "5": "Jesus said to them, `Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard.", "6": "From the time God first made people, he made them man and woman.", "7": "That is why a man must leave his father and mother and stay with his wife.", "8": "The two of them will be like one person. So they are not two people any more, but they are one person.", "9": "Man must not separate what God has joined together.'", "10": "When they were in the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.", "11": "So Jesus said, `If any man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery against her. [He takes another woman who is not his wife.]", "12": "If a woman sends away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.'", "13": "They brought children to Jesus.

He said, `Teacher, I have kept all those laws since I was a boy.'", "21": "Jesus looked at him. He loved him. He said, `You need one thing more. Go home. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor people. You will be rich in heaven. So be ready to carry your own cross and come with me.'", "22": "When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.", "23": "Then Jesus looked around at his disciples and said to them, `It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God.'", "24": "The disciples were surprised at his words.

He took the twelve disciples and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.", "33": "He said, `We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will judge him and say he must die.

After three days, he will rise again.'", "35": "James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, `Master, we want you to do for us anything we ask you.'", "36": "Jesus said, `What do you want me to do for you?'", "37": "They said, `Let one of us sit at your right side and one at your left side when you rule.'", "38": "But Jesus said, `You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from? Can you go through the big trouble that I will go through?'", "39": "`Yes,' they said. `We can.' Then Jesus said to them, `You will drink what I drink and you will have trouble the way I will have.", "40": "But I cannot choose who will sit at my right hand or at my left. It has been planned who will sit there.'", "41": "When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with James and John.", "42": "Jesus called them and said, `You know the people who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great will tell the others what to do.", "43": "But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great must help the others.", "44": "Anyone among you who wants to be first shall be a servant to the others.", "45": "The Son of Man did not come to have others help him.

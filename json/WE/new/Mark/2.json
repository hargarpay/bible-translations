So he said to the sick man, `Son, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.'", "6": "Some of the scribes were sitting there.", "7": "They were thinking, `Why does this man say such wrong things against God? He is not giving God respect! Who can forgive the wrong things people do? No one but God can do that.'", "8": "Jesus understood in his spirit what the scribes were thinking. He said right away, `Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?", "9": "Which is easier, to say to the sick man, \"The wrong things you have done are forgiven,\" or to say, \"Get up.

There were many who went with him.", "16": "The scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus ate with these people. They said to the disciples, `Why does he eat and drink with bad people?'", "17": "Jesus heard it. He said to them, `People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him. I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.'", "18": "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples were fasting [not eating food for a time].

{"1": "This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, God's Son.", "2": "The men of God, called prophets, long ago wrote about it this way: God said, `See, I send my man ahead of you to tell about you. He will make the way ready for you.", "3": "A man is calling out in the desert, \"Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him.\" '", "4": "John baptised people in the desert. He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised, and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did.", "5": "People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John. He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did.", "6": "John wore clothes made of camel's hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.", "7": "He told the people, `Another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings.", "8": "I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.'", "9": "At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee.

Because he did this, Jesus could not go into any large town freely. He stayed in places where only a few people were. There people came to him from everywhere."}

And yet you should listen to what he says.", "7": "When the people whom God has chosen call to him day and night, he will save them from their enemies. He may let them wait a time.", "8": "But I tell you, he will save them from their enemies soon. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find any people who believe in him?'", "9": "There were some people who thought they were very good. And they thought that other people were not good.

People told the rich man that the manager was wasting his things.", "2": "he called the manager and asked him, \"What is this I hear about you? Tell me what you have done. You cannot be my manager any more.\"", "3": "`Then the manager thought to himself, \"What will I do? My master is taking my work away from me. I am not strong enough to go out and dig. I am ashamed to beg.", "4": "I know what I will do. Then, when I lose my job, these people will take me into their own homes.\"", "5": "`So he called to him everyone who owed his master something. He asked the first man, \"How much do you owe my master?\"", "6": "He answered, \"A hundred tins of oil.\" The manager said, \"Take your paper. Sit down right now and write on it fifty.\"", "7": "Then he asked the next man, \"How much do you owe?\" He said, \"A hundred bags of grain.\" The manager said, \"Take your paper and write on it eighty.\"", "8": "`Then the master praised the manager who did wrong. He praised him because he did what was wise. The people of this world are wiser than the people who have the Light. They know how to get along with people like themselves.", "9": "`I tell you this. Money may be a wrong thing, but use it to make friends for yourselves. Then when your money is spent, they will be glad to see you come into that place where people live for ever.", "10": "`Anyone who can be trusted in a little matter can also be trusted in a big matter.

They made fun of him.", "15": "He said to them, `You try to make men think you are all right. But God knows your hearts. What men think is fine, God hates.", "16": "`The Law and the Prophets gave God's word until John came. Since then, the good news of God's kingdom has been told. And now everyone tries hard to get into the kingdom.", "17": "It would be easier to take away the sky and the earth than for the smallest part of the law to fall.'", "18": "`If a man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if the man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.'", "19": "`There was a rich man who dressed and lived like a king every day.", "20": "A poor man named Lazarus was put at his door.

They will say wrong things about people. They will not obey their parents. They will not be thankful. They will not keep anything holy.", "3": "They will have no love. They will not agree with anybody. They will tell lies about people. They will have no self-control. They will beat people. They will not love anything that is good.", "4": "They cannot be trusted. They will act quickly, without thinking. They are proud of themselves. They love to have fun more than they love God.", "5": "They act as if they worshipped God, yet they do not let God's power work in their lives. Keep away from people like that.", "6": "They are the kind who go quietly into people's houses. There they get foolish women to believe them. These women know that they have done many wrong things. And they want to do many kinds of wrong things.", "7": "They are always trying to learn, but never able to find out what is really true.", "8": "Jannes and Jambres were two men who were very much against Moses.

Everyone will see that they are wrong, just as people saw that Jannes and Jambres were wrong.", "10": "Timothy, you know my teaching and the way I lived. You know what I want to do and what I believe. You know my patience, my love, and my strength to bear trouble.", "11": "You know about my troubles.

You know who taught them to you.", "15": "From the time you were a child you knew the holy writings. They showed you how to be saved by believing in Christ Jesus.", "16": "All that is written in the holy writings comes from the Spirit of God. The holy writings are good for these things: to teach people, to show them when they are wrong, to make them see what is right, to teach them to do what is right.", "17": "In this way a person who belongs to God has all he needs. He is ready for every kind of good work."}

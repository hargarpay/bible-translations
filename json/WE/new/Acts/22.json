I had men and women tied and put into prison.", "5": "The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me.

Get up and be baptised. Wash away your wrong ways by calling on the name of the Lord!\" '", "17": "`After I went back to Jerusalem, I was talking to God in the temple one day. Something like a dream came over me.", "18": "I heard the Lord say to me, \"Leave Jerusalem quickly, right away. The people will not listen to the things you say about me.\"", "19": "And I said, \"Lord, they know that I put in prison those who believed in you. I beat them in all the meeting houses.", "20": "And I stood by and let people kill Stephen. He was one who talked for you.

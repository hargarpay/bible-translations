{"1": "When Jesus had finished saying this, he and his disciples went through the valley called Kidron. There was a garden with trees. He and his disciples went into the garden.", "2": "Jesus had gone to this place often with his disciples, so Judas knew where the place was. He was the one who gave Jesus over to the people who hated him.", "3": "The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers and guards with Judas. They had lamps, and torches, and things to fight with.", "4": "Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him. So he went out and said to them, `Who are you looking for?'", "5": "They answered, `Jesus from Nazareth.' Jesus said to them, `I am he.' Judas, who had given Jesus over to them, was standing with them.", "6": "When Jesus said to them, `I am he,' they all drew back suddenly and fell down.", "7": "So Jesus asked them again, `Who are you looking for?' And they said, `Jesus from Nazareth.'", "8": "Then Jesus answered, `I have already told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.'", "9": "So his words came true. He had said, `I did not lose one of those you gave me.'", "10": "Simon Peter had a long knife or sword. He took it out and hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.", "11": "Jesus said to Peter, `Put your sword back in its place. Must I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?'", "12": "Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the guards caught Jesus and tied him up.", "13": "First they took him to Annas. He was the father of Caiaphas' wife. Caiaphas was the high priest that year.", "14": "This was the same Caiaphas that had talked to the leaders of the Jews. He had said, `It is better for one man to die for the people.'", "15": "Simon Peter and one other disciple went after Jesus. The other disciple knew the high priest, so he went right in with Jesus through the gate of the high priest's large house.", "16": "But Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple who knew the high priest talked to the servant at the door and brought in Peter.", "17": "The servant at the door said to Peter, `Are you one of this man's disciples too?' Peter said, `No, I am not!'", "18": "It was cold there. The servants and the officers had made a small fire. They stood by it and warmed themselves. Peter stood by the fire also and warmed himself.", "19": "The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.", "20": "Jesus answered him, `I have talked so that anyone who wanted to could hear me. I have always taught in the meeting houses and in the temple. That is where the Jews always go. I have not said anything in a secret way.", "21": "Why do you ask me? The people heard me talk. Ask them what I told them. They know what I said.'", "22": "When he had said this, one of the officers who stood there hit Jesus. He said, `Is that the way you answer the high priest?'", "23": "Jesus answered him, `If I have said anything bad, tell me plainly what wrong thing I have said. If I have told the truth, why do you hit me?'", "24": "Jesus was still tied up. Annas sent him over to Caiaphas the high priest.", "25": "Simon Peter stayed by the fire and stood warming himself. So the people said to him, `Are you not one of his disciples also?' He said, `No, I am not!'", "26": "A servant was there. He was of the same family as the one whose ear Peter had cut off. He said, `Did I not see you in the garden with him? `", "27": "Again Peter said, `No!' And just then a cock called out.", "28": "Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the court house. It was early in the day. They themselves did not go into the court house. They did not want to become unclean. They wanted to eat the Passover Feast.", "29": "Pilate went out to the Jewish leaders and said, `What complaint do you bring against this man?'", "30": "They said to him, `If he were not a very bad man, then we would not have brought him to you.'", "31": "Pilate said, `Take him and judge him by your own law.' The leaders of the Jews said, `But we are not allowed to kill anyone.'", "32": "So this is the way the words of Jesus came true. He had said how he was going to die.", "33": "Then Pilate went back into the court house again. He called for Jesus and asked him, `Are you the King of the Jews?'", "34": "Jesus answered, `Do you ask me because you yourself think I am, or do you ask me because others said I am?'", "35": "Pilate answered, `Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have brought you here to me. Tell me, what have you done?'", "36": "Jesus answered him, `I am not a king in this world. If I were, my people would fight so that I would not be given to the Jews. But I am not a king in this world.'", "37": "So Pilate said, `So you really are a king then? ` Jesus answered, `You say that I am a king. The reason that I was born was that I should tell what is true. That is why I came into the world. Everyone who likes what is true listens to what I say.'", "38": "Pilate said, `What is truth?' When he had said this, he went out to the Jews again. He told them, `I find nothing wrong in this man.", "39": "But at the Passover Feast you always want me to let one prisoner go free for you. Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?'", "40": "Then they all shouted again, `Not this man, but Barabbas!' Barabbas was a man who had stolen things."}

And he cleans every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit.", "3": "What I said to you has made you clean already.", "4": "But you must be in me and I will be in you. The branch cannot bear fruit by itself. It must be joined to the tree. And you cannot do any good thing if you are not joined to me.", "5": "I am the fruit tree and you are the branches. I will be in the person who is in me. That person will have a fruitful life. But you can do nothing without me.", "6": "If any person is not in me, he is cut off like a branch and dies. People gather the dry branches and throw them into the fire to be burned.", "7": "If you are in me and obey me, you may ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.", "8": "If you do much good and become my disciples, you will make my Father's name great.", "9": "`I have loved you just as my Father has loved you.

But I have called you friends because you know everything that my Father has told me.", "16": "You did not choose me, but I chose you. I gave you a big work to do. That work is to go out and do good things and to make the good things that you do remain strong. If you do that, my Father will do anything you ask in my name.", "17": "`Here is the law I gave you.

If they had, then what they did would not be a wrong thing. But now they have seen me and hated me and my Father also.", "25": "This has happened in order to make the words of their law book come true.

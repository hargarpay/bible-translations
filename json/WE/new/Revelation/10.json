His face was like the sun and his legs were like posts of fire.", "2": "In his hand he had a small book that was open. He put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land.", "3": "He called in a very loud voice like a lion roaring. When he called, it was like the voices of seven thunders.", "4": "When the seven thunders had spoken, I was going to write down what they said. But I heard a voice from the sky that said, `Do not tell what the seven thunders said. Do not write it down.'", "5": "The angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward the sky.", "6": "He made a promise in the name of the one who lives for ever and ever. He made it in the name of the one who made the sky and everything in it, who made the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, `There is no more time.", "7": "But when the seventh angel calls by blowing his trumpet, then the secret plan of God will be finished. It will happen just as God told his servants, the prophets.'", "8": "The voice I heard in the sky talked to me again. It said, `Go to the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. Take the open book from his hand.'", "9": "So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. He said to me, `Take it and eat it. It will be bitter inside you, but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth.'", "10": "So I took the little book from the angel's hand and ate it. It was sweet like honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.", "11": "Then he said to me, `You must tell again what God is saying to many nations, countries, languages, and kings.'"}

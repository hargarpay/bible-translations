{"1": "When the Lamb opened the seventh lock, all was quiet in heaven for about a half hour.", "2": "Then I saw the seven angels stand in front of God. Seven horns or trumpets were given to them.", "3": "Another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a gold bowl. Plenty of incense was given to him. He was to put it with all the words of all God's people when they talk to him. He was to put it on the gold altar in front of God's throne.", "4": "The sweet smelling smoke of the burning incense went up at the same time as the prayer words of God's people. They went up from the hand of the angel that was standing in front of God.", "5": "Then the angel took the bowl and filled it with fire from the altar. He threw it on the earth. There was thunder, loud noises, and lightning. And the earth shook.", "6": "The seven angels who had the seven horns or trumpets got ready to blow them.", "7": "The first angel blew his trumpet. Rain like stones, and fire mixed with blood, fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burned. A third of the trees was burned. And one third of all the green grass was burned.", "8": "The second angel blew his trumpet. Then something like a big hill, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea.", "9": "Then a third of the sea became blood. A third of all things that lived in the sea died. A third of all the boats was broken.", "10": "The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star fell from the sky. It burned and gave a bright light. It fell on a third of the rivers and places where there is water.", "11": "The name of the star is Bitter. A third part of the water became bitter. Many men died because the water was made bad to drink.", "12": "The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was made dark. And a third of the moon and a third of the stars were made dark. A third part of them became dark. A third part of the day had no light, and also a third part of the night.", "13": "Then I looked and heard an angel who was flying across the sky. He called in a loud voice and said, `Trouble! Trouble! Trouble to the people who live on earth! Big trouble will come when the sound of the other trumpets is heard. The three angels are now ready to blow their trumpets!'"}

{"1": "I heard a loud voice coming from the temple. It said to the seven angels, `Go and pour the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth.'", "2": "So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. Then a bad, dirty sore came on the people who had the mark of the animal on them, and who worshipped its idol.", "3": "The second angel poured his bowl on the sea. It turned into blood like that of a person who has been killed. Everything in the sea that had life died.", "4": "The third angel poured his bowl on the rivers and the places where there was water. They turned into blood.", "5": "And I heard the angel of the water say, `Holy One, you who live now and who always have lived, and will live for ever; you are right because you have punished them this way.", "6": "They killed God's people and the prophets. Now you have given them blood to drink. This is what they should get!'", "7": "I heard the people under the altar say, `Yes, Lord God, you have all power! The way you punish is true and right!'", "8": "The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. Then the sun was given the power to burn people with fire.", "9": "People were burned because the sun was so hot. And they spoke wrongly about the name of God, cursing him because he had the power to send these troubles. But they would not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not respect and honour God.", "10": "The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. The place where he ruled became dark. People bit their tongues because of the pain they had.", "11": "They cursed God in heaven because of their pain and sores. But they did not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not turn back to God.", "12": "The sixth angel poured his bowl on the big river Euphrates. Its water dried up so that a road was made ready for the kings to come from the east.", "13": "I saw three bad spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the prophet who is not true.", "14": "They are the spirits of gods who are not true, and they do wonderful things. They go to the kings of the whole world and gather them to fight on the great day of God who has all power. (", "15": "`Look! I will come like a thief. The person who stays awake and dressed will be glad he did! He will not be without clothes and he will not be ashamed.')", "16": "They gathered at the place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.", "17": "Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the temple and the chair. It said, `It is finished!'", "18": "There were lightning's, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook very much. It shook more than it had ever shaken since people have been on earth.", "19": "The big city was broken into three parts. And the cities of the nations fell down. God remembered Babylon, the big city. He made it feel all of his great anger.", "20": "The islands all went away, and the mountains could not be seen.", "21": "Rain like big stones fell from the sky on men. Each stone weighed about a hundred pounds. Men cursed God because the big rain of stones fell on them. The trouble was very bad."}

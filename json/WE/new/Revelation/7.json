They did this so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.", "2": "Then I saw another angel coming up from the place where the sun rises. He had something to put the mark of the living God on people. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels. They had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea.", "3": "The angel said, `Do not hurt the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have put a mark on the foreheads of God's servants.'", "4": "And I heard that one hundred and forty-four thousand people were marked. They were from every tribe of Israel.", "5": "welve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin .", "9": "After this, I looked and saw many people. There were so many that no person could count them all. They were from every country, tribe, nation, and language. I saw them standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They wore white clothes and they had palm branches in their hands.", "10": "They called in a loud voice and said, `Our God who sits on the throne, and the Lamb: they are the Ones who save people.

And God will wipe every tear from their eyes.'"}

In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time.'", "13": "`You are like salt in the world. If salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? Salt that has no taste is good for nothing. The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road.", "14": "`You are like light in the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.", "15": "So also with a lamp. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. But they put it on the place for a lamp.

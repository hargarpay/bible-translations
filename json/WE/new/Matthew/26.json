His name was Caiaphas.", "4": "They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed.", "5": "But they said, `Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.'", "6": "When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.", "7": "While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus' head.", "8": "When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, `Why was the oil wasted like that?", "9": "The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people.'", "10": "When Jesus heard it, he said to them, `Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me.", "11": "You will always have poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.", "12": "She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.", "13": "I tell you the truth.

Say to him, \"The Teacher says, `My time is near. I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast.' \" '", "19": "The disciples did what Jesus told them. They made the Passover food ready.", "20": "When evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.", "21": "As they were eating, Jesus said, `I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me.'", "22": "They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, `Lord, is it I?'", "23": "Jesus answered them, `The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over.", "24": "The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him.

May what you want be done.'", "40": "Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, `What? Could you not watch with me for one hour?", "41": "Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A person's heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.'", "42": "Jesus went away again.

He said, `The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him.'", "49": "Right then he went to Jesus and said, `Greetings, Master!' And he kissed him.", "50": "Jesus said to him, `Friend, why have you come?' Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him.", "51": "One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.", "52": "Then Jesus said to him, `Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword.", "53": "Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels?", "54": "But then, how would God's word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be.'", "55": "At that same time Jesus said to the people, `Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught. But you did not try to catch me then.", "56": "All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.'

He said to Jesus, `Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.'", "63": "But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, `I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?'", "64": "Jesus answered him, `Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!'", "65": "Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, `What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said.", "66": "What do you think?' They said, `He should be killed.'", "67": "Then they spat on Jesus' face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands.", "68": "They said, `Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!'", "69": "Peter sat out in the yard.

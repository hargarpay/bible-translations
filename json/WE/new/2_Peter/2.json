And because of them, men will say wrong things about the true way.", "3": "Because they are greedy for money, they will trick you with lies. For a long time God has planned to punish them. They will be punished at the right time.", "4": "God punished the angels who did wrong. He put them into the darkest part of hell. They must be kept there until the time when they will be judged.", "5": "In the days long ago, God punished the world. But he saved Noah who told people what was right. And God saved seven other people. But he made water cover the world full of bad people.", "6": "God burned up the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He punished them so that no cities were left.

And he knows how to keep bad people until the day when he will judge them. And they are being punished even now.", "10": "Most of all, he will punish people who do the wrong things they want to do and who will not obey the men who rule over them.

They will die like the animals.", "13": "Bad things will happen to them because they have done wrong things. They think it is fun to have a good time during the day. They are like spots and sores.

They follow the same road that Balaam walked. He was the son of Beor. He loved the pay he would get for doing a wrong thing.", "16": "But he was told to stop doing wrong.

But they themselves are slaves of death. A man is a slave of anything that rules over him.", "20": "They left the wrong ways of the world because they knew our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

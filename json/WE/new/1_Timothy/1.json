I wanted you to tell some of the teachers not to teach wrong things.", "4": "Tell them not to use stories that are not true, and long histories of names. These things often make people quarrel.

And they do not know what they are trying to prove.", "8": "We know that the law is good when anyone uses it in the right way.", "9": "He must understand that the law was not made for the man who lives right. It was made for those who do not want any laws over them, and for those who will not obey. It was made for those who do not respect God, and those who are bad people.

It was made for those who beat their fathers or mothers, and for those who kill people.", "10": "It was made for those who use sex in the wrong way and for men who have sex with other men.

I thank him because he believed he could trust me, and he chose me for this work.", "13": "There was a time when I did not respect him. I troubled his people. I said wrong things about him.

He must have only one wife. He must be able to control himself. He must use good sense. He must behave himself well. He must be kind to strangers in his house. He must be a good teacher.", "3": "He must not get drunk. He must not fight. But he must be kind. He must not quarrel. He must not love money.", "4": "He must be a good leader for his own family. His children must obey him and respect him.", "5": "If a man does not know how to lead his own family, how can he take care of the church of God?", "6": "A church leader must not be a new believer.

This family is the church of the living God. The church people hold what is true and keeps it strong.", "16": "God's plan is very great as we all know. Here it is: we saw God as a man; God's Spirit proved he was right; angels saw him; the nations were told about him; people of the world believed in him; God took him up into heaven."}

For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.", "2": "Take the millstones and grind flour, put off your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.", "3": "Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your disgrace shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one.", "4": "Our Redeemer\u2014the Lord of hosts is his name\u2014 is the Holy One of Israel.", "5": "Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.", "6": "I was angry with my people; I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand; you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.", "7": "You said, \u201cI shall be mistress for ever\u201d, so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.", "8": "Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, \u201cI am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children\u201d:", "9": "These two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day; the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.", "10": "You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, \u201cNo one sees me\u201d; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, \u201cI am, and there is no one besides me.\u201d", "11": "But evil shall come upon you, which you will not know how to charm away; disaster shall fall upon you, for which you will not be able to atone; and ruin shall come upon you suddenly, of which you know nothing.", "12": "Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have laboured from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed; perhaps you may inspire terror.", "13": "You are wearied with your many counsels; let them stand forth and save you, those who divide the heavens, who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons make known what shall come upon you.", "14": "Behold, they are like stubble; the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!", "15": "Such to you are those with whom you have laboured, who have done business with you from your youth; they wander about, each in his own direction; there is no one to save you."}

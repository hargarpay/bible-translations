{"1": "In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train[a] of his robe filled the temple.", "2": "Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.", "3": "And one called to another and said: \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!\u201d[b]", "4": "And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.", "5": "And I said: \u201cWoe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!\u201d", "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.", "7": "And he touched my mouth and said: \u201cBehold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.\u201d", "8": "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?\u201d Then I said, \u201cHere am I! Send me.\u201d", "9": "And he said, \u201cGo, and say to this people: \u201c'Keep on hearing,[c] but do not understand; keep on seeing,[d] but do not perceive.'", "10": "Make the heart of this people dull,[e] and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.\u201d", "11": "Then I said, \u201cHow long, O Lord?\u201d And he said: \u201cUntil cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste,", "12": "and the Lord removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.", "13": "And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned[f] again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled.\u201d The holy seed[g] is its stump."}

{"1": "In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.", "2": "And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh[a] from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.", "3": "And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.", "4": "And the Rabshakeh said to them, \u201cSay to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours?", "5": "Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me?", "6": "Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.", "7": "But if you say to me, \u201cWe trust in the Lord our God\u201d, is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, \u201cYou shall worship before this altar\u201d?", "8": "Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.", "9": "How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?", "10": "Moreover, is it without the Lord that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.'\u201d", "11": "Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, \u201cPlease speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.\u201d", "12": "But the Rabshakeh said, \u201cHas my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?\u201d", "13": "Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: \u201cHear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!", "14": "Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.", "15": "Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord by saying, \u201cThe Lord will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\u201d", "16": "Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me[b] and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern,", "17": "until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.", "18": "Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, \u201cThe Lord will deliver us.\u201d Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?", "19": "Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?

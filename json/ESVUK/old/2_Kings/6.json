And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.", "5": "But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, \u201cAlas, my master! It was borrowed.\u201d", "6": "Then the man of God said, \u201cWhere did it fall?\u201d When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.", "7": "And he said, \u201cTake it up.\u201d So he reached out his hand and took it.", "8": "Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, \u201cAt such and such a place shall be my camp.\u201d", "9": "But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, \u201cBeware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.\u201d", "10": "And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.", "11": "And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, \u201cWill you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?\u201d", "12": "And one of his servants said, \u201cNone, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.\u201d", "13": "And he said, \u201cGo and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.\u201d It was told him, \u201cBehold, he is in Dothan.\u201d", "14": "So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.", "15": "When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all round the city. And the servant said, \u201cAlas, my master! What shall we do?\u201d", "16": "He said, \u201cDo not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\u201d", "17": "Then Elisha prayed and said, \u201cO Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.\u201d So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all round Elisha.", "18": "And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, \u201cPlease strike this people with blindness.\u201d So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha.", "19": "And Elisha said to them, \u201cThis is not the way, and this is not the city.

Shall I strike them down?\u201d", "22": "He answered, \u201cYou shall not strike them down. Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.\u201d", "23": "So he prepared for them a great feast, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master.

From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?\u201d", "28": "And the king asked her, \u201cWhat is your trouble?\u201d She answered, \u201cThis woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'", "29": "So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, 'Give your son, that we may eat him.' But she has hidden her son.\u201d", "30": "When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes\u2014now he was passing by on the wall\u2014and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body\u2014", "31": "and he said, \u201cMay God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today.\u201d", "32": "Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence, but before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, \u201cDo you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him.

And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.", "2": "And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, \u201cPut your hand under my thigh,", "3": "that I may make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,", "4": "but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.\u201d", "5": "The servant said to him, \u201cPerhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?\u201d", "6": "Abraham said to him, \u201cSee to it that you do not take my son back there.", "7": "The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land', he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.", "8": "But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.\u201d", "9": "So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.", "10": "Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia[a] to the city of Nahor.", "11": "And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.", "12": "And he said, \u201cO Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.", "13": "Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.", "14": "Let the young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your jar that I may drink', and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'\u2014let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this[b] I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.\u201d", "15": "Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.", "16": "The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden[c] whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.", "17": "Then the servant ran to meet her and said, \u201cPlease give me a little water to drink from your jar.\u201d", "18": "She said, \u201cDrink, my lord.\u201d And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.", "19": "When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, \u201cI will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.\u201d", "20": "So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.", "21": "The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the Lord had prospered his journey or not.", "22": "When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel,[d] and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,", "23": "and said, \u201cPlease tell me whose daughter you are.

For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.\u201d", "32": "So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.", "33": "Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, \u201cI will not eat until I have said what I have to say.\u201d He said, \u201cSpeak on.\u201d", "34": "So he said, \u201cI am Abraham's servant.", "35": "The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great.

You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house.", "41": "Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'", "42": "\u201cI came today to the spring and said, 'O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go,", "43": "behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, \u201cPlease give me a little water from your jar to drink\u201d,", "44": "and who will say to me, \u201cDrink, and I will draw for your camels also\u201d, let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master's son.'", "45": "\u201cBefore I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'", "46": "She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.' So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.", "47": "Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.", "48": "Then I bowed my head and worshipped the Lord and blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way[e] to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.", "49": "Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.\u201d", "50": "Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, \u201cThe thing has come from the Lord; we cannot speak to you bad or good.", "51": "Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the Lord has spoken.\u201d", "52": "When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the Lord.", "53": "And the servant brought out jewellery of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.", "54": "And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, \u201cSend me away to my master.\u201d", "55": "Her brother and her mother said, \u201cLet the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.\u201d", "56": "But he said to them, \u201cDo not delay me, since the Lord has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.\u201d", "57": "They said, \u201cLet us call the young woman and ask her.\u201d", "58": "And they called Rebekah and said to her, \u201cWill you go with this man?\u201d She said, \u201cI will go.\u201d", "59": "So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men.", "60": "And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, \u201cOur sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate him!\u201d[f]", "61": "Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.", "62": "Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.", "63": "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field towards evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming.", "64": "And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel", "65": "and said to the servant, \u201cWho is that man, walking in the field to meet us?\u201d The servant said, \u201cIt is my master.\u201d So she took her veil and covered herself.", "66": "And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.", "67": "Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."}

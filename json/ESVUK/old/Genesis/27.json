So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,", "6": "Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \u201cI heard your father speak to your brother Esau,", "7": "'Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the Lord before I die.'", "8": "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.", "9": "Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.", "10": "And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.\u201d", "11": "But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, \u201cBehold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.", "12": "Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.\u201d", "13": "His mother said to him, \u201cLet your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.\u201d", "14": "So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.", "15": "Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.", "16": "And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.", "17": "And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.", "18": "So he went in to his father and said, \u201cMy father.\u201d And he said, \u201cHere I am. Who are you, my son?\u201d", "19": "Jacob said to his father, \u201cI am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.\u201d", "20": "But Isaac said to his son, \u201cHow is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?\u201d He answered, \u201cBecause the Lord your God granted me success.\u201d", "21": "Then Isaac said to Jacob, \u201cPlease come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.\u201d", "22": "So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, \u201cThe voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\u201d", "23": "And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands.

Yes, and he shall be blessed.\u201d", "34": "As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, \u201cBless me, even me also, O my father!\u201d", "35": "But he said, \u201cYour brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.\u201d", "36": "Esau said, \u201cIs he not rightly named Jacob?[a] For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.\u201d Then he said, \u201cHave you not reserved a blessing for me?\u201d", "37": "Isaac answered and said to Esau, \u201cBehold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?\u201d", "38": "Esau said to his father, \u201cHave you but one blessing, my father?

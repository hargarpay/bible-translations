{"1": "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.", "2": "And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.", "3": "For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them.", "4": "They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.", "5": "For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number\u2014both they and their camels could not be counted\u2014so that they laid waste the land as they came in.", "6": "And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord.", "7": "When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on account of the Midianites,", "8": "the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, \u201cThus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage.", "9": "And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.", "10": "And I said to you, 'I am the Lord your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice.\u201d", "11": "Now the angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to hide it from the Midianites.", "12": "And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, \u201cThe Lord is with you, O mighty man of valour.\u201d", "13": "And Gideon said to him, \u201cPlease, sir,[a] if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?' But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.\u201d", "14": "And the Lord[b] turned to him and said, \u201cGo in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?\u201d", "15": "And he said to him, \u201cPlease, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.\u201d", "16": "And the Lord said to him, \u201cBut I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.\u201d", "17": "And he said to him, \u201cIf now I have found favour in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.", "18": "Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.\u201d And he said, \u201cI will stay till you return.\u201d", "19": "So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah[c] of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them.", "20": "And the angel of God said to him, \u201cTake the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.\u201d And he did so.", "21": "Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.", "22": "Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord. And Gideon said, \u201cAlas, O Lord God! For now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.\u201d", "23": "But the Lord said to him, \u201cPeace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.\u201d", "24": "Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, The Lord Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.", "25": "That night the Lord said to him, \u201cTake your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it", "26": "and build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.\u201d", "27": "So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.", "28": "When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.", "29": "And they said to one another, \u201cWho has done this thing?\u201d And after they had searched and enquired, they said, \u201cGideon the son of Joash has done this thing.\u201d", "30": "Then the men of the town said to Joash, \u201cBring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.\u201d", "31": "But Joash said to all who stood against him, \u201cWill you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.\u201d", "32": "Therefore on that day Gideon[d] was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, \u201cLet Baal contend against him,\u201d because he broke down his altar.", "33": "Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.", "34": "But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.", "35": "And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.", "36": "Then Gideon said to God, \u201cIf you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,", "37": "behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.\u201d", "38": "And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.", "39": "Then Gideon said to God, \u201cLet not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew.\u201d", "40": "And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew."}

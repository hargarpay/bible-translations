And the word of the Lord was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.", "2": "At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.", "3": "The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.", "4": "Then the Lord called Samuel, and he said, \u201cHere I am!\u201d", "5": "and ran to Eli and said, \u201cHere I am, for you called me.\u201d But he said, \u201cI did not call; lie down again.\u201d So he went and lay down.", "6": "And the Lord called again, \u201cSamuel!\u201d and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, \u201cHere I am, for you called me.\u201d But he said, \u201cI did not call, my son; lie down again.\u201d", "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.", "8": "And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, \u201cHere I am, for you called me.\u201d Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the young man.", "9": "Therefore Eli said to Samuel, \u201cGo, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant hears.'\u201d So Samuel went and lay down in his place.", "10": "And the Lord came and stood, calling as at other times, \u201cSamuel! Samuel!\u201d And Samuel said, \u201cSpeak, for your servant hears.\u201d", "11": "Then the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cBehold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.", "12": "On that day I will fulfil against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.", "13": "And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house for ever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God,[a] and he did not restrain them.", "14": "Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering for ever.\u201d", "15": "Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord.

And he said, \u201cIt is the Lord.

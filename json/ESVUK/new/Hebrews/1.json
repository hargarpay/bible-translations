After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,", "4": "having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.", "5": "For to which of the angels did God ever say, \u201cYou are my Son, today I have begotten you\u201d? Or again, \u201cI will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son\u201d?", "6": "And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, \u201cLet all God's angels worship him.\u201d", "7": "Of the angels he says, \u201cHe makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire.\u201d", "8": "But of the Son he says, \u201cYour throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of your kingdom.", "9": "You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.\u201d", "10": "And, \u201cYou, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands;", "11": "they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment,", "12": "like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed.[a] But you are the same, and your years will have no end.\u201d", "13": "And to which of the angels has he ever said, \u201cSit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet\u201d?", "14": "Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?"}

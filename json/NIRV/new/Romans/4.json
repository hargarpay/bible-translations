{"1": "What should we say about these things? What did Abraham, the father of our people, discover about being right with God? ", "2": "Did he become right with God because of something he did? If so, he could brag about it. But he couldn't brag to God. ", "3": "What do we find in Scripture? It says, \u201cAbraham believed God. God accepted Abraham's faith, and so his faith made him right with God.\u201d (Genesis 15:6)", "4": "When a person works, their pay is not considered a gift. It is owed to them. ", "5": "But things are different with God. He makes ungodly people right with himself. If people trust in him, their faith is accepted even though they do not work. Their faith makes them right with God. ", "6": "King David says the same thing. He tells us how blessed people are when God makes them right with himself. They are blessed because they don't have to do anything in return. David says,", "7": "\u201cBlessed are those whose lawless acts are forgiven. Blessed are those whose sins are taken away.", "8": "Blessed is the person whose sin the Lord never counts against them.\u201d (Psalm 32:1,2)", "9": "Is that blessing only for those who are circumcised? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised? We have been saying that God accepted Abraham's faith. So his faith made him right with God. ", "10": "When did it happen? Was it after Abraham was circumcised, or before? It was before he was circumcised, not after! ", "11": "He was circumcised as a sign of the covenant God had made with him. It showed that his faith had made him right with God before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the father of all believers who have not been circumcised. God accepts their faith. So their faith makes them right with him. ", "12": "And Abraham is also the father of those who are circumcised and believe. So just being circumcised is not enough. Those who are circumcised must also follow the steps of our father Abraham. He had faith before he was circumcised.", "13": "Abraham and his family received a promise. God promised that Abraham would receive the world. It would not come to him because he obeyed the law. It would come because of his faith, which made him right with God. ", "14": "Do those who depend on the law receive the promise? If they do, faith would mean nothing. God's promise would be worthless. ", "15": "The law brings God's anger. Where there is no law, the law can't be broken.", "16": "The promise is based on God's grace. The promise comes by faith. All of Abraham's children will certainly receive the promise. And it is not only for those who are ruled by the law. Those who have the same faith that Abraham had are also included. He is the father of us all. ", "17": "It is written, \u201cI have made you a father of many nations.\u201d (Genesis 17:5) God considers Abraham to be our father. The God that Abraham believed in gives life to the dead. Abraham's God also creates things that did not exist before.", "18": "When there was no reason for hope, Abraham believed because he had hope. He became the father of many nations, exactly as God had promised. God said, \u201cThat is how many children you will have.\u201d (Genesis 15:5) ", "19": "Abraham did not become weak in his faith. He accepted the fact that he was past the time when he could have children. At that time Abraham was about 100 years old. He also realized that Sarah was too old to have children. ", "20": "But Abraham kept believing in God's promise. He became strong in his faith. He gave glory to God. ", "21": "He was absolutely sure that God had the power to do what he had promised. ", "22": "That's why \u201cGod accepted Abraham because he believed. So his faith made him right with God.\u201d (Genesis 15:6) ", "23": "The words \u201cGod accepted Abraham's faith\u201d were written not only for Abraham. ", "24": "They were written also for us. We believe in the God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. So God will accept our faith and make us right with himself. ", "25": "Jesus was handed over to die for our sins. He was raised to life in order to make us right with God."}

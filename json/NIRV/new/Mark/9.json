They were all alone. There in front of them his appearance was changed. ", "3": "His clothes became so white they shone. They were whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. ", "4": "Elijah and Moses appeared in front of Jesus and his disciples. The two of them were talking with Jesus.", "5": "Peter said to Jesus, \u201cRabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\u201d ", "6": "Peter didn't really know what to say, because they were so afraid.", "7": "Then a cloud appeared and covered them. A voice came from the cloud. It said, \u201cThis is my Son, and I love him. Listen to him!\u201d", "8": "They looked around. Suddenly they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.", "9": "They came down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen.

But they asked each other what \u201crising from the dead\u201d meant.", "11": "Then they asked Jesus, \u201cWhy do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?\u201d", "12": "Jesus replied, \u201cThat's right. Elijah does come first. He makes all things new again. So why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and not be accepted? ", "13": "I tell you, Elijah has come. They have done to him everything they wanted to do. They did it just as it is written about him.\u201d", "14": "When Jesus and those who were with him came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them.

He is controlled by an evil spirit. Because of this, my son can't speak anymore. ", "18": "When the spirit takes hold of him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth. He grinds his teeth. And his body becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit. But they couldn't do it.\u201d", "19": "\u201cYou unbelieving people!\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cHow long do I have to stay with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\u201d", "20": "So they brought him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into a fit. He fell to the ground. He rolled around and foamed at the mouth.", "21": "Jesus asked the boy's father, \u201cHow long has he been like this?\u201d \u201cSince he was a child,\u201d he answered.

Never enter him again.\u201d", "26": "The spirit screamed. It shook the boy wildly. Then it came out of him. The boy looked so lifeless that many people said, \u201cHe's dead.\u201d ", "27": "But Jesus took him by the hand. He lifted the boy to his feet, and the boy stood up.", "28": "Jesus went indoors. Then his disciples asked him in private, \u201cWhy couldn't we drive out the evil spirit?\u201d", "29": "He replied, \u201cThis kind can come out only by prayer.\u201d", "30": "They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were. ", "31": "That was because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be handed over to men. They will kill him. After three days he will rise from the dead.\u201d ", "32": "But they didn't understand what he meant. And they were afraid to ask him about it.", "33": "Jesus and his disciples came to a house in Capernaum. There he asked them, \u201cWhat were you arguing about on the road?\u201d ", "34": "But they kept quiet. On the way, they had argued about which one of them was the most important person.", "35": "Jesus sat down and called for the 12 disciples to come to him. Then he said, \u201cAnyone who wants to be first must be the very last. They must be the servant of everyone.\u201d", "36": "Jesus took a little child and had the child stand among them.

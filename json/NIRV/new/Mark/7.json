He prophesied about you people who pretend to be good. He said, \u201c\u2009'These people honor me by what they say. But their hearts are far away from me.", "7": "Their worship doesn't mean anything to me. They teach nothing but human rules.' (Isaiah 29:13)", "8": "You have let go of God's commands.

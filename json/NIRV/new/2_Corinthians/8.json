", "21": "We are trying hard to do what both the Lord and people think is right.", "22": "We are also sending another one of our brothers with them. He has often proved to us in many ways that he is very committed. He is now even more committed because he has great faith in you. ", "23": "Titus is my helper. He and I work together among you. Our brothers are messengers from the churches. They honor Christ. ", "24": "So show them that you really love them. Show them why we are proud of you. Then the churches can see it."}

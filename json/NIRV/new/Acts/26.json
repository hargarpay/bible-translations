So I beg you to be patient as you listen to me.", "4": "\u201cThe Jewish people all know how I have lived ever since I was a child. They know all about me from the beginning of my life. They know how I lived in my own country and in Jerusalem. ", "5": "They have known me for a long time. So if they wanted to, they could tell you how I have lived. I have lived by the rules of the Pharisees. Those rules are harder to obey than those of any other Jewish group. ", "6": "Today I am on trial because of the hope I have. I believe in what God promised our people of long ago. ", "7": "It is the promise that our 12 tribes are hoping to see come true. Because of this hope they serve God with faithful and honest hearts day and night. King Agrippa, it is also because of this hope that these Jews are bringing charges against me.

So I did everything I could to oppose his name. ", "10": "That's just what I was doing in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests, I put many of the Lord's people in prison. I agreed that they should die. ", "11": "I often went from one synagogue to another to have them punished. I tried to force them to speak evil things against Jesus. All I wanted to do was hurt them.

It is hard for you to go against what you know is right.'", "15": "\u201cThen I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' \u201c\u2009'I am Jesus,' the Lord replied. 'I am the one you are opposing.

Then I preached in Jerusalem and in all Judea. And then I preached to the Gentiles. I told them to turn away from their sins to God. The way they live must show that they have turned away from their sins. ", "21": "That's why some Jews grabbed me in the temple courtyard and tried to kill me.

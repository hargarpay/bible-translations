We landed at Tyre. There our ship was supposed to unload. ", "4": "We looked for the believers there and stayed with them for seven days. The believers tried to keep Paul from going on to Jerusalem. They were led by the Holy Spirit to do this. ", "5": "When it was time to leave, we continued on our way. All the believers, including their whole families, went with us out of the city.

They will certainly hear that you have come. ", "23": "So do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a promise to God. ", "24": "Take them with you.

They stirred up the whole crowd and grabbed Paul. ", "28": "\u201cFellow Israelites, help us!\u201d they shouted. \u201cThis is the man who teaches everyone in all places against our people. He speaks against our law and against this holy place. Besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple. He has made this holy place 'unclean.'\u2009\u201d ", "29": "They said this because they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul. They thought Paul had brought him into the temple.", "30": "The whole city was stirred up. People came running from all directions. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Right away the temple gates were shut. ", "31": "The people were trying to kill Paul. But news reached the commander of the Roman troops.

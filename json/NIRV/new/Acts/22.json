I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but I grew up here in Jerusalem. I studied with Gamaliel. I was well trained by him in the law given to our people long ago. I wanted to serve God as much as any of you do today. ", "4": "I hurt the followers of the Way of Jesus. I sent many of them to their death. I arrested men and women. I threw them into prison. ", "5": "The high priest and the whole Council can be witnesses of this themselves. I even had some official letters they had written to their friends in Damascus.

He wanted to tell you his plans for you. You have seen the Blameless One. You have heard words from his mouth. ", "15": "Now you will tell everyone about what you have seen and heard.

The people here will not accept what you tell them about me.'", "19": "\u201c\u2009'Lord,' I replied, 'these people know what I used to do. I went from one synagogue to another and put believers in prison. I also beat them. ", "20": "Stephen was a man who told other people about you. I stood there when he was killed. I had agreed that he should die. I even guarded the coats of those who were killing him.'", "21": "\u201cThen the Lord said to me, 'Go.

{"1": "So let us move beyond the simple teachings about Christ. Let us grow up as believers. Let us not start all over again with the basic teachings. They taught us that we need to turn away from doing things that lead to death. They taught us that we must have faith in God. ", "2": "These basic teachings taught us about different ways of becoming \u201cclean.\u201d They taught us about placing hands of blessing on people. They taught us that people will rise from the dead. They taught us that God will judge everyone. And they taught us that what he decides will last forever. ", "3": "If God permits, we will go beyond those teachings and grow up.", "4": "What if some people fall away from the faith? It won't be possible to bring them back. It is true that they have seen the light. They have tasted the heavenly gift. They have shared in the Holy Spirit. ", "5": "They have tasted the good things of God's word. They have tasted the powers of the age to come. ", "6": "But they have fallen away from the faith. So it won't be possible to bring them back. They won't be able to turn away from their sins. They are losing everything. That's because they are nailing the Son of God to the cross all over again. They are bringing shame on him in front of everyone. ", "7": "Some land drinks the rain that falls on it. It produces a crop that is useful to those who farm the land. That land receives God's blessing. ", "8": "But other land produces only thorns and weeds. That land isn't worth anything. It is in danger of coming under God's curse. In the end, it will be burned.", "9": "Dear friends, we have to say these things. But we are sure of better things in your case. We are talking about the things that have to do with being saved. ", "10": "God is fair. He will not forget what you have done. He will remember the love you have shown him. You showed it when you helped his people. And you show it when you keep on helping them. ", "11": "We want each of you to be faithful to the very end. If you are, then what you hope for will fully happen. ", "12": "We don't want you to slow down. Instead, be like those who have faith and are patient. They will receive what God promised.", "13": "When God made his promise to Abraham, God gave his word. There was no one greater than himself to promise by. So he promised by making an appeal to himself. ", "14": "He said, \u201cI will certainly bless you. I will give you many children.\u201d (Genesis 22:17) ", "15": "Abraham was patient while he waited. Then he received what God promised him.", "16": "People promise things by someone greater than themselves. Giving your word makes a promise certain. It puts an end to all arguing. ", "17": "So God gave his word when he made his promise. He wanted to make it very clear that his purpose does not change. He wanted those who would receive what was promised to know this. ", "18": "When God made his promise, he gave his word. He did this so we would have good reason not to give up. Instead, we have run to take hold of the hope set before us. This hope is set before us in God's promise. So God made his promise and gave his word. These two things can't change. He couldn't lie about them. ", "19": "Our hope is certain. It is something for the soul to hold on to. It is strong and secure. It goes all the way into the Most Holy Room behind the curtain. ", "20": "That is where Jesus has gone. He went there to open the way ahead of us. He has become a high priest forever, just like Melchizedek."}

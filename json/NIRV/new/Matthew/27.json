Then he went away and hanged himself.", "6": "The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, \u201cIt's against the law to put this money into the temple fund. It is blood money. It has paid for a man's death.\u201d ", "7": "So they decided to use the money to buy a potter's field. People from other countries would be buried there. ", "8": "That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. ", "9": "Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true. He had said, \u201cThey took the 30 silver coins. That price was set for him by the people of Israel. ", "10": "They used the coins to buy a potter's field, just as the Lord commanded me.\u201d (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1\u201313; 32:6\u20139)", "11": "Jesus was standing in front of the governor.

Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\u201d", "50": "After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, he died.", "51": "At that moment the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split. ", "52": "Tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. ", "53": "They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they went into the holy city.

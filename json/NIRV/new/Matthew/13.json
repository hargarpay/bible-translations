", "3": "Then he told them many things using stories. He said, \u201cA farmer went out to plant his seed. ", "4": "He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up. ", "5": "Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasn't deep. ", "6": "When the sun came up, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots. ", "7": "Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants. ", "8": "Still other seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than what was planted. ", "9": "Whoever has ears should listen.\u201d", "10": "The disciples came to him. They asked, \u201cWhy do you use stories when you speak to the people?\u201d", "11": "He replied, \u201cBecause you have been given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven.

If anyone doesn't have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken away from them. ", "13": "Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people.

Birds come and rest in its branches.\u201d", "33": "Jesus told them still another story. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman mixed it into 60 pounds of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough.\u201d", "34": "Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.

I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\u201d She said this because Jews don't have anything to do with Samaritans.", "10": "Jesus answered her, \u201cYou do not know what God's gift is.

A time is coming when you will not worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem. ", "22": "You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know.

My food is to finish his work. ", "35": "Don't you have a saying? You say, 'It's still four months until harvest time.' But I tell you, open your eyes! Look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest right now. ", "36": "Even now the one who gathers the crop is getting paid. They are already harvesting the crop for eternal life.

They had seen everything he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast. That was because they had also been there.", "46": "Once more, Jesus visited Cana in Galilee. Cana is where he had turned the water into wine. A royal official was there. His son was sick in bed at Capernaum. ", "47": "The official heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea. So he went to Jesus and begged him to come and heal his son. The boy was close to death.", "48": "Jesus told him, \u201cYou people will never believe unless you see signs and wonders.\u201d", "49": "The royal official said, \u201cSir, come down before my child dies.\u201d", "50": "\u201cGo,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cYour son will live.\u201d The man believed what Jesus said, and so he left.

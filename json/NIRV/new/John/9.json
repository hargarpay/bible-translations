{"1": "As Jesus went along, he saw a man who was blind. He had been blind since he was born. ", "2": "Jesus' disciples asked him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned? Was this man born blind because he sinned? Or did his parents sin?\u201d", "3": "\u201cIt isn't because this man sinned,\u201d said Jesus. \u201cIt isn't because his parents sinned. He was born blind so that God's power could be shown by what's going to happen. ", "4": "While it is still day, we must do the works of the one who sent me. Night is coming. Then no one can work. ", "5": "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u201d", "6": "After he said this, he spit on the ground. He made some mud with the spit. Then he put the mud on the man's eyes. ", "7": "\u201cGo,\u201d he told him. \u201cWash in the Pool of Siloam.\u201d Siloam means Sent. So the man went and washed. And he came home able to see.", "8": "His neighbors and people who had seen him earlier begging asked questions. \u201cIsn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?\u201d they asked. ", "9": "Some claimed that he was. Others said, \u201cNo. He only looks like him.\u201d But the man who had been blind kept saying, \u201cI am the man.\u201d", "10": "\u201cThen how were your eyes opened?\u201d they asked.", "11": "He replied, \u201cThe man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed. Then I could see.\u201d", "12": "\u201cWhere is this man?\u201d they asked him. \u201cI don't know,\u201d he said.", "13": "They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. ", "14": "The day Jesus made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath day. ", "15": "So the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see. \u201cHe put mud on my eyes,\u201d the man replied. \u201cThen I washed. And now I can see.\u201d", "16": "Some of the Pharisees said, \u201cJesus has not come from God. He does not keep the Sabbath day.\u201d But others asked, \u201cHow can a sinner do such signs?\u201d So the Pharisees did not agree with one another.", "17": "Then they turned again to the blind man. \u201cWhat do you have to say about him?\u201d they asked. \u201cIt was your eyes he opened.\u201d The man replied, \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d", "18": "They still did not believe that the man had been blind and now could see. So they sent for his parents. ", "19": "\u201cIs this your son?\u201d they asked. \u201cIs this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\u201d", "20": "\u201cWe know he is our son,\u201d the parents answered. \u201cAnd we know he was born blind. ", "21": "But we don't know how he can now see. And we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is an adult. He can speak for himself.\u201d ", "22": "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. The leaders had already made this decision about Jesus. Anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. ", "23": "That was why the man's parents said, \u201cHe is an adult. Ask him.\u201d", "24": "Again the Pharisees called the man who had been blind to come to them. \u201cGive glory to God by telling the truth!\u201d they said. \u201cWe know that the man who healed you is a sinner.\u201d", "25": "He replied, \u201cI don't know if he is a sinner or not. I do know one thing. I was blind, but now I can see!\u201d", "26": "Then they asked him, \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d", "27": "He answered, \u201cI have already told you. But you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u201d", "28": "Then they began to attack him with their words. \u201cYou are this fellow's disciple!\u201d they said. \u201cWe are disciples of Moses! ", "29": "We know that God spoke to Moses. But we don't even know where this fellow comes from.\u201d", "30": "The man answered, \u201cThat is really surprising! You don't know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. ", "31": "We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does what he wants them to do. ", "32": "Nobody has ever heard of anyone opening the eyes of a person born blind. ", "33": "If this man had not come from God, he could do nothing.\u201d", "34": "Then the Pharisees replied, \u201cWhen you were born, you were already deep in sin. How dare you talk like that to us!\u201d And they threw him out of the synagogue.", "35": "Jesus heard that the Pharisees had thrown the man out of the synagogue. When Jesus found him, he said, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d", "36": "\u201cWho is he, sir?\u201d the man asked. \u201cTell me, so I can believe in him.\u201d", "37": "Jesus said, \u201cYou have now seen him. In fact, he is the one speaking with you.\u201d", "38": "Then the man said, \u201cLord, I believe.\u201d And he worshiped him.", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cI have come into this world to judge it. I have come so that people who are blind will see. I have come so that people who can see will become blind.\u201d", "40": "Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this. They asked, \u201cWhat? Are we blind too?\u201d", "41": "Jesus said, \u201cIf you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, you remain guilty."}

So he said to Philip, \u201cWhere can we buy bread for these people to eat?\u201d ", "6": "He asked this only to test Philip. He already knew what he was going to do.", "7": "Philip answered him, \u201cSuppose we were able to buy enough bread for each person to have just a bite. That would take more than half a year's pay!\u201d", "8": "Another of his disciples spoke up. It was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He said, ", "9": "\u201cHere is a boy with five small loaves of barley bread. He also has two small fish. But how far will that go in such a large crowd?\u201d", "10": "Jesus said, \u201cHave the people sit down.\u201d There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down. About 5,000 men were there. ", "11": "Then Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks. He handed out the bread to those who were seated. He gave them as much as they wanted. And he did the same with the fish.", "12": "When all of them had enough to eat, Jesus spoke to his disciples. \u201cGather the leftover pieces,\u201d he said. \u201cDon't waste anything.\u201d ", "13": "So they gathered what was left over from the five barley loaves.

", "2": "I heard a sound from heaven. It was like the roar of rushing waters and loud thunder. The sound I heard was like the music of harps being played. ", "3": "Then everyone sang a new song in front of the throne. They sang it in front of the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000. They had been set free from the evil of the earth. ", "4": "They had not committed sexual sins with women. They had kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among human beings as a first offering to God and the Lamb. ", "5": "They told no lies. They are without blame.", "6": "I saw another angel. He was flying high in the air. He came to tell everyone on earth the good news that will always be true. He told it to every nation, tribe and people, no matter what language they spoke. ", "7": "In a loud voice he said, \u201cHave respect for God. Give him glory. The hour has come for God to judge. Worship him who made the heavens and the earth. Worship him who made the sea and the springs of water.\u201d", "8": "A second angel followed him. He said, \u201c\u2009'Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen!' (Isaiah 21:9) The city of Babylon made all the nations drink the strong wine of her terrible sins.\u201d", "9": "A third angel followed them. He said in a loud voice, \u201cThere will be trouble for anyone who worships the beast and its statue! There will be trouble for anyone who has its mark on their forehead or their hand! ", "10": "They, too, will drink the wine of God's great anger. His wine has been poured full strength into the cup of his anger. They will be burned with flaming sulfur. The holy angels and the Lamb will see it happen. ", "11": "The smoke of their terrible suffering will rise for ever and ever. Day and night, there will be no rest for anyone who worships the beast and its statue. There will be no rest for anyone who receives the mark of its name.\u201d ", "12": "God's people need to be very patient. They are the ones who obey God's commands. And they remain faithful to Jesus.", "13": "Then I heard a voice from heaven. \u201cWrite this,\u201d it said. \u201cBlessed are the dead who die as believers in the Lord from now on.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says the Holy Spirit. \u201cThey will rest from their labor. What they have done will not be forgotten.\u201d", "14": "I looked, and there in front of me was a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was one who looked \u201clike a son of man.\u201d (Daniel 7:13) He wore a gold crown on his head. In his hand was a sharp, curved blade for cutting grain.

The earth is ready to be harvested.\u201d ", "16": "So the one sitting on the cloud swung his blade over the earth. And the earth was harvested.", "17": "Another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He too had a sharp, curved blade. ", "18": "Still another angel came from the altar. He was in charge of the fire on the altar. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp blade. \u201cTake your blade,\u201d he said, \u201cand gather the bunches of grapes from the earth's vine. Its grapes are ripe.\u201d ", "19": "So the angel swung his blade over the earth. He gathered its grapes. Then he threw them into a huge winepress. The winepress stands for God's anger. ", "20": "In the winepress outside the city, the grapes were stomped on. Blood flowed out of the winepress. It spread over the land for about 180 miles. It rose as high as the horses' heads."}

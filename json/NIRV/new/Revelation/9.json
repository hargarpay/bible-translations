The pain the people suffered was like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes. ", "6": "In those days, people will look for a way to die but won't find it. They will want to die, but death will escape them.", "7": "The locusts looked like horses ready for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold.

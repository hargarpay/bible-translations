Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted.'\u2009\u201d", "5": "Then Jesus said to them, \u201cSuppose you have a friend.

So he said to them, \u201cAny kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. A family that is divided against itself will fall.

", "26": "Then the evil spirit goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there. That person is worse off than before.\u201d", "27": "As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out.

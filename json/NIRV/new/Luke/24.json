", "5": "The women were terrified. They bowed down with their faces to the ground. Then the men said to them, \u201cWhy do you look for the living among the dead? ", "6": "Jesus is not here! He has risen! Remember how he told you he would rise. It was while he was still with you in Galilee. ", "7": "He said, 'The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people.

They were all gathered together. ", "34": "They were saying, \u201cIt's true! The Lord has risen! He has appeared to Simon!\u201d ", "35": "Then the two of them told what had happened to them on the way.

He said, \u201cMay you have peace!\u201d", "37": "They were surprised and terrified. They thought they were seeing a ghost. ", "38": "Jesus said to them, \u201cWhy are you troubled? Why do you have doubts in your minds? ", "39": "Look at my hands and my feet. It's really me! Touch me and see. A ghost does not have a body or bones. But you can see that I do.\u201d", "40": "After he said that, he showed them his hands and feet. ", "41": "But they still did not believe it. They were amazed and filled with joy.

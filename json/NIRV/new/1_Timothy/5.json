", "2": "Treat older women as if they were your mothers. Treat younger women as if they were your sisters. Be completely pure in the way you treat them.", "3": "Take care of the widows who really need help. ", "4": "But suppose a widow has children or grandchildren. They should first learn to put their faith into practice. They should care for their own family. In that way they will pay back their parents and grandparents. That pleases God. ", "5": "A widow who really needs help and is left all alone puts her hope in God. Night and day she keeps on praying. Night and day she asks God for help. ", "6": "But a widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still living. ", "7": "Give these instructions to the people. Then no one can be blamed. ", "8": "Everyone should provide for their own relatives. Most of all, everyone should take care of their own family. If they don't, they have left the faith.

", "10": "She must be well known for the good things she does. That includes bringing up children. It includes inviting guests into her home. It includes washing the feet of the Lord's people. It includes helping those who are in trouble. A widow should spend her time doing all kinds of good things.", "11": "Don't put younger widows on that kind of list. They might want pleasure more than they want Christ. Then they would want to get married again. ", "12": "If they do that, they will be judged. They have broken their first promise. ", "13": "Besides, they get into the habit of having nothing to do. They go around from house to house. They waste their time. They also bother other people and say things that make no sense. They shouldn't say those things. ", "14": "So here is the advice I give to younger widows. Get married. Have children. Take care of your own homes.

", "20": "But those elders who are sinning should be corrected in front of everyone. This will be a warning to the others. ", "21": "I command you to follow these instructions. I command you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels. Treat everyone the same. Don't favor one person over another.", "22": "Don't be too quick to place your hands on others to set them apart to serve God. Don't take part in the sins of others.

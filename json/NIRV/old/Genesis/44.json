", "2": "Then put my silver cup in the youngest one's sack. Put it there along with the money he paid for his grain.\u201d So the manager did what Joseph told him to do.", "3": "When morning came, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. ", "4": "They hadn't gone very far from the city when Joseph spoke to his manager. \u201cGo after those men right away,\u201d he said. \u201cCatch up with them. Say to them, 'My master was good to you. Why have you paid him back by doing evil? ", "5": "Isn't this the cup my master drinks from? Doesn't he also use it to find things out? You have done an evil thing.'\u2009\u201d", "6": "When the manager caught up with them, he told them what Joseph had said. ", "7": "But they said to him, \u201cWhy do you say these things? We would never do anything like that! ", "8": "We even brought back to you from Canaan the money we found in our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?

Don't you know that a man like me has ways to find things out?\u201d", "16": "\u201cWhat can we say to you?\u201d Judah replied. \u201cWhat can we say? How can we prove we haven't done anything wrong? God has shown you that we are guilty. We are now your slaves.

We told him what you had said.", "25": "\u201cThen our father said, 'Go back. Buy a little more food.' ", "26": "But we said, 'We can't go down.

I said, 'Father, I'll bring him back to you. If I don't, you can put the blame on me for the rest of my life.'", "33": "\u201cNow then, please let me stay here. Let me be your slave in place of the boy. Let the boy return with his brothers. ", "34": "How can I go back to my father if the boy isn't with me? No!

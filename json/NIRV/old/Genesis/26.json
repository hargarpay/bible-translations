I will give all these lands to you and your children after you. And I will keep my word that I gave to your father Abraham. ", "4": "I will make your children after you as many as the stars in the sky. And I will give them all these lands. All nations on earth will be blessed because of your children. ", "5": "I will do all these things because Abraham obeyed me. He did everything I required. He kept my commands, my rules and my instructions.\u201d ", "6": "So Isaac stayed in Gerar.", "7": "The men of that place asked him about his wife. He said, \u201cShe's my sister.\u201d He was afraid to say, \u201cShe's my wife.\u201d He thought, \u201cThe men of this place might kill me because of Rebekah. She's a beautiful woman.\u201d", "8": "Isaac had been there a long time. One day Abimelek, the king of the Philistines, looked down from a window. He saw Isaac hugging and kissing his wife Rebekah.

They filled them with dirt.", "16": "Then Abimelek said to Isaac, \u201cMove away from us. You have become too powerful for us.\u201d", "17": "So Isaac moved away from there. He camped in the Valley of Gerar, where he made his home. ", "18": "Isaac opened up the wells again. They had been dug in the time of his father Abraham.

", "22": "Isaac moved on from there and dug another well. But no one argued about that one. So he named it Rehoboth. He said, \u201cNow the Lord has given us room. Now we will be successful in the land.\u201d", "23": "From there Isaac went up to Beersheba. ", "24": "That night the Lord appeared to him. He said, \u201cI am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid. I am with you. I will bless you. I will increase the number of your children because of my servant Abraham.\u201d", "25": "Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the Lord.

You were angry with me and sent me away.\u201d", "28": "They answered, \u201cWe saw clearly that the Lord was with you. So we said, 'There should be an agreement between us and you.' We want to make a peace treaty with you. ", "29": "Give us your word that you won't harm us. We didn't harm you. We always treated you well. We sent you away peacefully. And now the Lord has blessed you.\u201d", "30": "Then Isaac had a feast prepared for them. They ate and drank. ", "31": "Early the next morning the men made a treaty with each other. Then Isaac sent the men of Gerar on their way. And they left peacefully.", "32": "That day Isaac's servants came to him. They told him about the well they had dug. They said, \u201cWe've found water!\u201d ", "33": "So he named it Shibah. To this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.", "34": "When Esau was 40 years old, he got married to Judith.

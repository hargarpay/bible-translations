Get your bow and arrows. Go out to the open country. Hunt some wild animals for me. ", "4": "Prepare for me the kind of tasty food I like. Bring it to me to eat. Then I'll give you my blessing before I die.\u201d", "5": "Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. Esau left for the open country. He went to hunt for a wild animal and bring it back. ", "6": "Then Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \u201cLook, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau. ", "7": "He said, 'Bring me a wild animal. Prepare some tasty food for me to eat. Then I'll give you my blessing before I die. The Lord will be my witness.'\u2009\u201d ", "8": "Rebekah continued, \u201cMy son, listen carefully. Do what I tell you. ", "9": "Go out to the flock.

I want to know whether you really are my son Esau.\u201d", "22": "Jacob went close to his father. Isaac touched him and said, \u201cThe voice is the voice of Jacob. But the hands are the hands of Esau.\u201d ", "23": "Isaac didn't recognize Jacob. Jacob's hands were covered with hair like those of his brother Esau. So Isaac blessed him.

Bless me too, my father!\u201d", "35": "But Isaac said, \u201cYour brother came and tricked me. He took your blessing.\u201d", "36": "Esau said, \u201cIsn't Jacob just the right name for him? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me. First, he took my rights as the oldest son. And now he's taken my blessing!\u201d Then Esau asked, \u201cHaven't you saved any blessing for me?\u201d", "37": "Isaac answered Esau, \u201cI've made him ruler over you. I've made all his relatives serve him. And I've provided him with grain and fresh wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?\u201d", "38": "Esau said to his father, \u201cDo you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!\u201d Then Esau wept loudly.", "39": "His father Isaac answered him, \u201cYou will live far away from the fruit of the earth. You will live far away from the dew of heaven above.", "40": "You will live by using the sword. And you will serve your brother. But you will grow restless. Then you will throw off the heavy load he has caused you to carry.\u201d", "41": "Esau was angry with Jacob. He was angry because of the blessing his father had given to Jacob. He said to himself, \u201cThe days of sorrow over my father's death are near. Then I'll kill my brother Jacob.\u201d", "42": "Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said. So she sent for her younger son Jacob. She said to him, \u201cYour brother Esau is planning to get back at you by killing you. ", "43": "Now then, my son, do what I say. Run away at once to my brother Laban in Harran. ", "44": "Stay with him until your brother's anger calms down. ", "45": "When he forgets what you did to him, I'll let you know. Then you can come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?\u201d", "46": "Then Rebekah spoke to Isaac. She said, \u201cI'm sick of living because of Esau's Hittite wives. Suppose Jacob also marries a Hittite woman. If he does, my life won't be worth living.\u201d"}

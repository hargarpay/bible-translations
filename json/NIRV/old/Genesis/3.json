If you do, you will die.'\u2009\u201d", "4": "\u201cYou will certainly not die,\u201d the serpent said to the woman. ", "5": "\u201cGod knows that when you eat fruit from that tree, you will know things you have never known before. Like God, you will be able to tell the difference between good and evil.\u201d", "6": "The woman saw that the tree's fruit was good to eat and pleasing to look at. She also saw that it would make a person wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her. And he ate it. ", "7": "Then both of them knew things they had never known before. They realized they were naked. So they sewed together fig leaves and made clothes for themselves.", "8": "Then the man and his wife heard the Lord God walking in the garden. It was during the coolest time of the day.

And I ate it.\u201d", "13": "Then the Lord God said to the woman, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d The woman said, \u201cThe serpent tricked me. That's why I ate the fruit.\u201d", "14": "So the Lord God spoke to the serpent. He said, \u201cBecause you have done this, \u201cYou are set apart from all livestock and all wild animals. I am putting a curse on you. You will crawl on your belly. You will eat dust all the days of your life.", "15": "I will make you and the woman hate each other. Your children and her children will be enemies. Her son will crush your head.

The angels and the sword guarded the way to the tree of life."}

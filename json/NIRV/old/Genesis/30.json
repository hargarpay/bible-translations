{"1": "Rachel saw that she wasn't having any children by Jacob. So she became jealous of her sister. She said to Jacob, \u201cGive me children, or I'll die!\u201d", "2": "Jacob became angry with her. He said, \u201cDo you think I'm God? He's the one who has kept you from having children.\u201d", "3": "Then she said, \u201cHere's my servant Bilhah. Sleep with her so that she can have children for me. Then I too can have a family through her.\u201d", "4": "So Rachel gave Jacob her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her. ", "5": "And Bilhah became pregnant. She had a son by him. ", "6": "Then Rachel said, \u201cGod has stood up for my rights. He has listened to my prayer and given me a son.\u201d So she named him Dan.", "7": "Rachel's servant Bilhah became pregnant again. She had a second son by Jacob. ", "8": "Then Rachel said, \u201cI've had a great struggle with my sister. Now I've won.\u201d So she named him Naphtali.", "9": "Leah saw that she had stopped having children. So she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. ", "10": "Leah's servant Zilpah had a son by Jacob. ", "11": "Then Leah said, \u201cWhat good fortune!\u201d So she named him Gad.", "12": "Leah's servant Zilpah had a second son by Jacob. ", "13": "Then Leah said, \u201cI'm so happy! The women will call me happy.\u201d So she named him Asher.", "14": "While the wheat harvest was being gathered, Reuben went out into the fields. He found some mandrake plants. He brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, \u201cPlease give me some of your son's mandrakes.\u201d", "15": "But Leah said to her, \u201cIsn't it enough that you took my husband away? Are you going to take my son's mandrakes too?\u201d Rachel said, \u201cAll right. Jacob can sleep with you tonight if you give me your son's mandrakes.\u201d", "16": "Jacob came in from the fields that evening. Leah went out to meet him. \u201cYou have to sleep with me tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI've traded my son's mandrakes for that time with you.\u201d So he slept with her that night.", "17": "God listened to Leah. She became pregnant and had a fifth son by Jacob. ", "18": "Then Leah said, \u201cGod has rewarded me because I gave my female servant to my husband.\u201d So she named the boy Issachar.", "19": "Leah became pregnant again. She had a sixth son by Jacob. ", "20": "Then Leah said, \u201cGod has given me a priceless gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor. I've had six sons by him.\u201d So she named the boy Zebulun.", "21": "Some time later she had a daughter. She named her Dinah.", "22": "Then God listened to Rachel. He showed concern for her. He made it possible for her to have children. ", "23": "She became pregnant and had a son. Then she said, \u201cGod has taken away my shame.\u201d ", "24": "She said, \u201cMay the Lord give me another son.\u201d So she named him Joseph.", "25": "After Rachel had Joseph, Jacob spoke to Laban. He said, \u201cSend me on my way. I want to go back to my own home and country. ", "26": "Give me my wives and children. I worked for you to get them. So I'll be on my way. You know how much work I've done for you.\u201d", "27": "But Laban said to him, \u201cIf you are pleased with me, stay here. I've discovered that the Lord has blessed me because of you.\u201d ", "28": "He continued, \u201cName your pay. I'll give it to you.\u201d", "29": "Jacob said to him, \u201cYou know how hard I've worked for you. You know that your livestock has done better under my care. ", "30": "You had only a little before I came. But that little has become a lot. The Lord has blessed you everywhere I've been. But when can I do something for my own family?\u201d", "31": "\u201cWhat should I give you?\u201d Laban asked. \u201cDon't give me anything,\u201d Jacob replied. \u201cJust do one thing for me. Then I'll go on taking care of your flocks and watching over them. ", "32": "Let me go through all your flocks today. Let me remove every speckled or spotted sheep. Let me remove every dark-colored lamb. Let me remove every speckled or spotted goat. They will be my pay. ", "33": "My honesty will be a witness about me in days to come. It will be a witness every time you check on what you have paid me. Suppose I have a goat that doesn't have speckles or spots. Or suppose I have a lamb that isn't dark colored. Then it will be considered stolen.\u201d", "34": "\u201cI agree,\u201d said Laban. \u201cLet's do what you have said.\u201d ", "35": "That same day Laban removed all the male goats that had stripes or spots. He removed all the female goats that had speckles or spots. They were the ones that had white on them. He also removed all the dark-colored lambs. He had his sons take care of them. ", "36": "Then he put a journey of three days between himself and Jacob. But Jacob continued to take care of the rest of Laban's flocks.", "37": "Jacob took freshly cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees. He made white stripes on the branches by peeling off their bark. ", "38": "Then he placed the peeled branches in all the stone tubs where the animals drank water. He placed them there so they would be right in front of the flocks when they came to drink. The flocks were ready to mate when they came to drink. ", "39": "So they mated in front of the branches. And the flocks gave birth to striped, speckled or spotted little ones. ", "40": "Jacob put the little ones of the flock to one side by themselves. But he made the older ones face the striped and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. In that way, he made separate flocks for himself. He didn't put them with Laban's animals. ", "41": "Every time the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the branches in the stone tubs. He would place them in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches. ", "42": "But if the animals were weak, he wouldn't place the branches there. So the weak animals went to Laban. And the strong ones went to Jacob. ", "43": "That's how Jacob became very rich. He became the owner of large flocks. He also had many male and female servants. And he had many camels and donkeys."}

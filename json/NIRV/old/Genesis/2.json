The Lord God made the earth and the heavens.", "5": "At that time, bushes had not yet appeared on the earth. Plants had not started to grow. The Lord God had not sent rain on the earth. And there was no one to farm the land. ", "6": "But streams came from the earth. They watered the entire surface of the ground. ", "7": "Then the Lord God formed a man. He made him out of the dust of the ground. God breathed the breath of life into him. And the man became a living person.", "8": "The Lord God had planted a garden in the east in Eden. He put in the garden the man he had formed. ", "9": "The Lord God made every kind of tree grow out of the ground. The trees were pleasing to look at. Their fruit was good to eat.

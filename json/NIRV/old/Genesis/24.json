I'm living among the people of Canaan. But I want you to promise me that you won't get a wife for my son from their daughters.

Get a wife for my son Isaac from there.\u201d", "5": "The servant asked Abraham, \u201cWhat if the woman doesn't want to come back with me to this land? Then should I take your son back to the country you came from?\u201d", "6": "\u201cMake sure you don't take my son back there,\u201d Abraham said.

I'll say to her, 'Please lower your jar so I can have a drink.' Suppose she says, 'Have a drink of water, and I'll get some for your camels too.' Then let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. That's how I'll know you have been kind to my master.\u201d", "15": "Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out.

She got enough for all his camels. ", "21": "The man didn't say a word. He watched her closely. He wanted to learn whether the Lord had given him success on the journey he had made.", "22": "The camels finished drinking. Then the man took out a gold nose ring. It weighed about a fifth of an ounce. He also took out two gold bracelets. They weighed about four ounces. ", "23": "Then he asked, \u201cWhose daughter are you? And please tell me something else. Is there room in your father's house for us? Can we spend the night there?\u201d", "24": "She answered, \u201cI'm the daughter of Bethuel.

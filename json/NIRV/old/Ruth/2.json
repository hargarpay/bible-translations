{"1": "Naomi had a relative on her husband's side of the family. The relative's name was Boaz. He was a very important man from the family of Elimelek.", "2": "Ruth, who was from Moab, spoke to Naomi. Ruth said, \u201cLet me go out to the fields. I'll pick up the grain that has been left. I'll do it behind anyone who is pleased with me.\u201d Naomi said to her, \u201cMy daughter, go ahead.\u201d ", "3": "So Ruth went out to a field and began to pick up grain. She worked behind those cutting and gathering the grain. As it turned out, she was working in a field that belonged to Boaz. He was from the family of Elimelek.", "4": "Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. He greeted those cutting and gathering the grain. He said, \u201cMay the Lord be with you!\u201d \u201cAnd may the Lord bless you!\u201d they replied.", "5": "Boaz spoke to the man in charge of his workers. He asked, \u201cWho does that young woman belong to?\u201d", "6": "The man replied, \u201cShe's from Moab. She came back from there with Naomi. ", "7": "The young woman said, 'Please let me walk behind the workers. Let me pick up the grain that is left.' She came into the field. She has kept on working here from morning until now. She took only one short rest in the shade.\u201d", "8": "So Boaz said to Ruth, \u201cDear woman, listen to me. Don't pick up grain in any other field. Don't go anywhere else. Stay here with the women who work for me. ", "9": "Keep your eye on the field where the men are cutting grain. Walk behind the women who are gathering it. Pick up the grain that is left. I've told the men not to bother you. When you are thirsty, go and get a drink. Take water from the jars the men have filled.\u201d", "10": "When Ruth heard that, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, \u201cWhy are you being so kind to me? In fact, why are you even noticing me? I'm from another country.\u201d", "11": "Boaz replied, \u201cI've been told all about you. I've heard about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. I know that you left your father and mother. I know that you left your country. You came to live with people you didn't know before. ", "12": "May the Lord reward you for what you have done. May the Lord, the God of Israel, bless you richly. You have come to him to find safety under his care.\u201d", "13": "\u201cSir, I hope you will continue to be kind to me,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cYou have made me feel safe. You have spoken kindly to me. And I'm not even as important as one of your servants!\u201d", "14": "When it was time to eat, Boaz spoke to Ruth again. \u201cCome over here,\u201d he said. \u201cHave some bread. Dip it in the wine vinegar.\u201d She sat down with the workers. Then Boaz offered her some grain that had been cooked. She ate all she wanted. She even had some left over. ", "15": "Ruth got up to pick up more grain. Then Boaz gave orders to his men. He said, \u201cLet her take some stalks from what the women have tied up. Don't tell her she can't. ", "16": "Even pull out some stalks for her. Leave them for her to pick up. Don't tell her she shouldn't do it.\u201d", "17": "So Ruth picked up grain in the field until evening. Then she separated the barley from the straw. The barley weighed 30 pounds. ", "18": "She carried it back to town. Her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out the food left over from the lunch Boaz had given her. She gave it to Naomi.", "19": "Her mother-in-law asked her, \u201cWhere did you pick up grain today? Where did you work? May the man who noticed you be blessed!\u201d Then Ruth told her about the man whose field she had worked in. \u201cThe name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,\u201d she said.", "20": "\u201cMay the Lord bless him!\u201d Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. \u201cThe Lord is still being kind to those who are living and those who are dead.\u201d She continued, \u201cThat man is a close relative of ours. He's one of our family protectors.\u201d", "21": "Then Ruth, who was from Moab, said, \u201cHe told me more. He even said, 'Stay with my workers until they have finished bringing in all my grain.'\u2009\u201d", "22": "Naomi replied to her daughter-in-law Ruth. She said, \u201cThat will be good for you, my daughter. Go with the women who work for him. You might be harmed if you go to someone else's field.\u201d", "23": "So Ruth stayed close to the women who worked for Boaz as she picked up grain. She worked until the time when all the barley and wheat had been harvested. And she lived with her mother-in-law."}

The night air has made my hair wet.'", "3": "\u201cBut I've taken off my robe. Must I put it on again? I've washed my feet. Must I get them dirty again?", "4": "My love put his hand through the opening. My heart began to pound for him.", "5": "I got up to open the door for my love. My hands dripped with myrrh.

He looks like the finest cedar tree in the mountains of Lebanon.", "16": "His mouth is very sweet. Everything about him is delightful. That's what the one who loves me is like. That's what my friend is like, women of Jerusalem.\u201d"}

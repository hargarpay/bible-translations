And our ears tell us what's true and what isn't.", "4": "So let's choose for ourselves what is right. Let's learn together what is good.", "5": "\u201cJob says, 'I'm not guilty of doing anything wrong. But God doesn't treat me fairly.", "6": "Even though I'm right, he thinks I'm a liar. Even though I'm not guilty, his arrows give me wounds that can't be healed.'", "7": "Is there anyone like Job? He accuses God as easily as he drinks water.", "8": "He's a companion of those who do evil. He spends his time with sinful people.", "9": "He asks, 'What good is it to try to please God?'", "10": "\u201cSo listen to me, you men who have understanding. God would never do what is evil. The Mighty One would never do what is wrong.", "11": "He pays back everyone for what they've done. He gives them exactly what they should get.", "12": "It isn't possible for God to do wrong.

Even people who are mighty are removed, but not by human hands.", "21": "\u201cHis eyes see how people live. He watches every step they take.", "22": "There is no deep shadow or total darkness where those who do what is evil can hide.", "23": "God doesn't need to bring charges against anyone. He knows they are guilty. So he doesn't need to have them appear in his court to be judged.", "24": "He destroys the mighty without asking them questions in court. Then he sets others up in their places.", "25": "He knows what they do. So he crushes them during the night.", "26": "He punishes them for the sins they commit.

I can't do it for you. So tell me what you know.", "34": "\u201cYou men who have understanding have spoken. You wise men who hear me have said to me,", "35": "'Job doesn't know what he's talking about.

There I will put them on trial. I will judge them for what they have done to my people Israel. They scattered them among the nations. They divided up my land among themselves.", "3": "They cast lots for my people. They sold boys into slavery to get prostitutes. They sold girls to buy some wine to drink.", "4": "\u201cTyre and Sidon, why are you doing things like that to me? And why are you doing them, all you people in Philistia? Are you trying to get even with me for something I have done? If you are, I will pay you back for it in a quick and speedy way. ", "5": "You took my silver and gold. You carried off my finest treasures to your temples. ", "6": "You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks. You wanted to send them far away from their own country.", "7": "\u201cBut now I will stir them up into action. I will bring them back from the places you sold them to. And I will do to you what you did to them. ", "8": "I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah. And they will sell them to the Sabeans.

Lord, send down your soldiers from heaven!", "12": "The Lord says, \u201cStir up the nations into action! Let them march into the valley where I will judge them. I will take my seat in court. I will judge all the surrounding nations.", "13": "My soldiers, swing your blades. The nations are ripe for harvest. Come and stomp on them as if they were grapes. Crush them until the winepress of my anger is full. Do it until the wine spills over from the places where it is stored.

People from other lands will never again attack it.", "18": "\u201cAt that time fresh wine will drip from the mountains. Milk will flow down from the hills. Water will run through all Judah's valleys. A fountain will flow out of my temple. It will water the places where acacia trees grow.", "19": "But Egypt will be deserted. Edom will become a dry and empty desert. They did terrible harm to the people of Judah. My people were not guilty of doing anything wrong. But Egypt and Edom spilled their blood anyway.", "20": "My people will live in Judah and Jerusalem forever. The land will be their home for all time to come.", "21": "Egypt and Edom have spilled my people's blood. Should I let them escape my judgment? No, I will not.\u201d The Lord lives in Zion!"}

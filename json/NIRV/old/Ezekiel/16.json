So I got rid of Sodom and her daughters, just as you have seen. ", "51": "Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You sinned even more than they did. I hate those sins. Compared to what you did, you made your sisters seem godly. ", "52": "So you will be dishonored. You have given your sisters an excuse for what they did. Your sins were far worse than theirs. In fact, your sisters appear to be more godly than you. So then, be ashamed. You will be dishonored. You have made them appear to be godly.", "53": "\u201cI will not only give you back what you had before. I will also do the same thing for Sodom and her daughters.

It will last forever. ", "61": "Then you will remember how you have lived. You will be ashamed when I give you Samaria and Sodom. Samaria is your older sister. Sodom is your younger one. I will give them and their daughters to you as daughters. That can't happen based on my old covenant with you. ", "62": "So I will make my new covenant with you. Then you will know that I am the Lord. ", "63": "I will pay for all the sins you have committed. Then you will remember what you have done. You will be ashamed of it.

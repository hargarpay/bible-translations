He tells them, \u201cI will send swords to kill your people. I will destroy the high places where you worship other gods. ", "4": "Your altars will be torn down. Your incense altars will be smashed. And I will kill your people in front of the statues of your gods. ", "5": "I will put the dead bodies of Israelites in front of those statues. I will scatter your bones around your altars.

Your incense altars will be broken down. And everything you have made will be wiped out. ", "7": "Your people will fall down dead among you.

The one who is near will be killed by swords. Anyone who is left alive and is spared will die of hunger. And in this way I will pour out my great anger on them.

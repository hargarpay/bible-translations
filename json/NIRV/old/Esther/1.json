The military leaders of Persia and Media were there. So were the princes and the nobles of the territories he ruled over.", "4": "Every day for 180 days he showed his guests the great wealth of his kingdom. He also showed them how glorious his kingdom was. ", "5": "When those days were over, the king gave another feast. It lasted for seven days. It was held in the garden of the king's courtyard. It was for all the people who lived in the fort of Susa. Everyone from the least important person to the most important was invited. ", "6": "The garden was decorated with white and blue linen banners. They hung from ropes that were made out of white linen and purple cloth. The ropes were connected to silver rings on marble pillars. There were gold and silver couches in the garden. They were placed on a floor that was made out of small stones. The floor had purple crystal, marble, mother-of-pearl and other stones of great value. ", "7": "Royal wine was served in gold cups. Each cup was different from all the others.

She hasn't obeyed my command. The officials told her what I ordered her to do, didn't they?\u201d", "16": "Then Memukan gave a reply to the king and the nobles. He said, \u201cQueen Vashti has done what is wrong. But she didn't do it only against you, King Xerxes. She did it also against all the nobles.

Those laws can never be changed. Let the royal order say that Vashti can never see you again. Also let her position as queen be given to someone who is better than she is. ", "20": "And let your order be announced all through your entire kingdom. Then all women will have respect for their husbands, from the least important to the most important.\u201d", "21": "The king and his nobles were pleased with that advice. So he did what Memukan had suggested. ", "22": "The king sent messages out to every territory in the kingdom. He sent them to each territory in its own writing. He sent them to every nation in its own language. The messages announced that every man should rule over his own family, using his own language."}

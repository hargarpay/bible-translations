Before I was born the Lord spoke my name.", "2": "He made my words like a sharp sword. He hid me in the palm of his hand. He made me into a sharpened arrow. He took good care of me and kept me safe.", "3": "He said to me, \u201cYou are my true servant Israel. I will show my glory through you.\u201d", "4": "But I said, \u201cIn spite of my hard work, I feel as if I haven't accomplished anything. I've used up all my strength.

Like a bride, you will wear them proudly.", "19": "\u201cZion, you were destroyed. Your land was left empty. It was turned into a dry and empty desert.

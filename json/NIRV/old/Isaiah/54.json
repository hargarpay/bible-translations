They will make their homes in the deserted cities of those nations.", "4": "\u201cDo not be afraid. You will not be put to shame anymore. Do not be afraid of being dishonored.

I am now your husband. My name is the Lord Who Rules Over All. I am the Holy One of Israel. I have set you free. I am the God of the whole earth.", "6": "You were like a wife who was deserted.

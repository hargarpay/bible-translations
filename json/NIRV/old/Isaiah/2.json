It will be the highest mountain of all. It will be raised above the hills. All the nations will go to it.", "3": "People from many nations will go there. They will say, \u201cCome. Let us go up to the Lord's mountain. Let's go to the temple of Jacob's God. He will teach us how we should live. Then we will live the way he wants us to.\u201d The law of the Lord will be taught at Zion. His message will go out from Jerusalem.", "4": "He will judge between the nations. He'll settle problems among many of them. They will hammer their swords into plows. They'll hammer their spears into pruning tools. Nations will not go to war against one another. They won't even train to fight anymore.", "5": "People of Jacob, come. Let us live the way the Lord has taught us to.", "6": "Lord, you have deserted the people of Jacob. They are your people. The land is full of false beliefs from the east. The people practice evil magic, just as the Philistines do. They do what ungodly people do.", "7": "Their land is full of silver and gold. There is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses. There is no end to their chariots.", "8": "Their land is full of statues of gods. Their people bow down to what their own hands have made. They bow down to what their fingers have shaped.", "9": "So people will be brought low. Everyone will be made humble. Do not forgive them.", "10": "Go and hide in caves in the rocks, you people! Hide in holes in the ground. Hide from the terrifying presence of the Lord! Hide when he comes in glory and majesty!", "11": "Anyone who brags will be brought low. Anyone who is proud will be made humble. The Lord alone will be honored at that time.", "12": "The Lord who rules over all has set apart a day when he will judge. He has set it apart for all those who are proud and think they are important. He has set it apart for all those who brag about themselves. All of them will be brought low.", "13": "The Lord has set that day apart for all the cedar trees in Lebanon. They are very tall.

He has set it apart for all the high hills.", "15": "He has set it apart for every high tower and every strong wall.", "16": "He has set it apart for every trading ship and every beautiful boat.", "17": "Anyone who brags will be brought low. Anyone who is proud will be made humble. The Lord alone will be honored at that time.", "18": "And the statues of gods will totally disappear.", "19": "People will run and hide in caves in the rocks. They will go into holes in the ground. They will run away from the terrifying presence of the Lord. They will run when he comes in glory and majesty. When he comes, he will shake the earth.", "20": "People had made some statues of gods out of silver. They had made others out of gold. Then they worshiped them. But when the Lord comes, they will throw the statues away to the moles and bats.", "21": "Those people will run and hide in caves in the rocks. They will go into holes in the cliffs. They will run away from the terrifying presence of the Lord. They will run when he comes in glory and majesty. When he comes, he will shake the earth.", "22": "Stop trusting in mere human beings, who can't help you. They only live for a little while. What good are they?"}

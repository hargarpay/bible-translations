{"1": "At that time a song will be sung in the land of Judah. It will say, \u201cWe have a strong city. God's saving power surrounds it like walls and towers.", "2": "Open its gates so that those who do what is right can enter. They are the people who remain faithful to God.", "3": "Lord, you will give perfect peace to those who commit themselves to be faithful to you. That's because they trust in you.", "4": "\u201cTrust in the Lord forever. The Lord himself is the Rock. The Lord will keep us safe forever.", "5": "He brings down those who are proud. He pulls down cities that have high walls. They fall down flat on the ground. He throws them down to the dust.", "6": "The feet of those who were treated badly stomp on them. Those who were poor walk all over them.\u201d", "7": "The path of godly people is level. You are the God who does what is right. You make their way smooth.", "8": "Lord, we are living the way your laws command us to live. We are waiting for you to act. We want your honor and fame to be known.", "9": "My heart longs for you at night. My spirit longs for you in the morning. You will come and judge the earth. Then the people of the world will learn to do what is right.", "10": "Sometimes grace is shown to sinful people. But they still don't learn to do what is right. They keep on doing evil even in a land where others are honest and fair. They don't have any respect for the majesty of the Lord.", "11": "Lord, you have raised your hand high to punish them. But they don't even see it. Let them see how much you love your people. Then they will be put to shame. Let the fire you are saving for your enemies burn them up.", "12": "Lord, you give us peace. You are the one who has done everything we've accomplished.", "13": "Lord, you are our God. Other masters besides you have ruled over us. But your name is the only one we honor.", "14": "Those other masters are now dead. They will never live again. Their spirits won't rise from the dead. You punished them and destroyed them. You wiped out all memory of them.", "15": "Lord, you have made our nation grow. You have made it larger. You have gained glory for yourself. You have increased the size of our land.", "16": "Lord, when your people were suffering, they came to you. When you punished them, they could barely whisper a prayer.", "17": "Lord, you made us like a woman who is about to have a baby. She groans and cries out in pain.", "18": "We were pregnant and groaned with pain. But nothing was born. We didn't bring your saving power to the earth. And the people of the world have not come to life.", "19": "Lord, your people who have died will live again. Their bodies will rise from the dead. Let those who lie in the grave wake up and shout for joy. You give life, Lord, like the dew of the morning. So the earth will give up its dead people.", "20": "My people, go into your houses. Shut the doors behind you. Hide yourselves for a little while. Do it until the Lord's anger is over.", "21": "He is coming from the place where he lives. He will punish the people of the earth for their sins. The blood spilled on the earth will be brought out into the open. The ground will no longer hide those who have been killed."}

He'll take away fortune tellers and elders.", "3": "He'll take away captains of groups of 50 men. He'll take away government leaders. He'll take away advisers, skilled workers and those who are clever at doing evil magic.", "4": "The Lord will make mere youths their leaders. Children will rule over them.", "5": "People will treat one another badly. They will fight against one another. They will fight against their neighbors. Young people will attack old people.

Instead of wearing belts, they will wear ropes. Instead of having beautiful hair, they won't have any hair at all. Instead of wearing fine clothes, they'll wear rough clothes to show how sad they are. Instead of being beautiful, on their bodies they'll have the marks of their owners.", "25": "Jerusalem, your men will be killed by swords. Your soldiers will die in battle.", "26": "The city of Zion will be very sad. Like a widow, she will lose everything. She will sit on the ground and mourn."}

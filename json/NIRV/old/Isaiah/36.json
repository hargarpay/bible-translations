{"1": "Sennacherib attacked and captured all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them. It was in the 14th year of the rule of Hezekiah. Sennacherib was king of Assyria. ", "2": "He sent his field commander from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. He sent him along with a large army. The commander stopped at the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool. It was on the road to the Washerman's Field. ", "3": "Eliakim, Shebna and Joah went out to him. Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, was in charge of the palace. Shebna was the secretary. Joah, the son of Asaph, kept the records.", "4": "The field commander said to them, \u201cGive Hezekiah this message. Tell him, \u201c\u2009'Sennacherib is the great king of Assyria. He says, \u201cWhy are you putting your faith in what your king says? ", "5": "You say you have a military plan. You say you have a strong army. But your words don't mean anything. Who are you depending on? Why don't you want to stay under my control? ", "6": "Look, I know you are depending on Egypt. Why are you doing that? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem. Try leaning on it. It will only cut your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is just like that to everyone who depends on him. ", "7": "But suppose you say to me, 'We are depending on the Lord our God.' Didn't Hezekiah remove your god's high places and altars? Didn't Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship at the altar in Jerusalem'?", "8": "\u201c\u2009'\u2009\u201cCome on. Make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria.

You can't drive away even the least important officer among my master's officials. ", "10": "Besides, do you think I've come without being sent by the Lord? Have I come to attack and destroy this land without receiving a message from him? The Lord himself told me to march out against your country.

Don't speak to us in Hebrew. If you do, the people on the wall will be able to understand you.\u201d", "12": "But the commander replied, \u201cMy master sent me to say these things. Are these words only for your master and you to hear? Aren't they also for the people sitting on the wall? They are going to suffer just like you. They'll have to eat their own waste. They'll have to drink their own urine.\u201d", "13": "Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language. He called out, \u201cPay attention to what the great king of Assyria is telling you. ", "14": "He says, 'Don't let Hezekiah trick you. He can't save you!

", "20": "Which one of all the gods of those countries has been able to save their lands from me? So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power?'\u2009\u201d", "21": "But the people remained silent. They didn't say anything. That's because King Hezekiah had commanded, \u201cDon't answer him.\u201d", "22": "Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, went to Hezekiah. Eliakim was in charge of the palace. Shebna the secretary went with him. So did Joah, the son of Asaph. Joah kept the records. All of them went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn. They told him what the field commander had said."}

They themselves are carried off as prisoners.", "3": "The Lord says, \u201cFamily of Jacob, listen to me. Pay attention, you people of Israel who are left alive. I have taken good care of you since your life began. I have carried you since you were born as a nation.", "4": "I will continue to carry you even when you are old. I will take good care of you even when your hair is gray. I have made you, and I will carry you. I will take care of you, and I will save you.

From a land far away, he will come like a bird that kills its food. I will bring about what I have said. I will do what I have planned.", "12": "Listen to me, you stubborn people. Pay attention, you who now refuse to do what I have said is right.", "13": "The time is almost here for me to make everything right. It is not far away.

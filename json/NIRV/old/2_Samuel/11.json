Swords kill one person as well as another. So keep on attacking the city. Destroy it.' Tell that to Joab. It will cheer him up.\u201d", "26": "Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead. She mourned over him. ", "27": "When her time of sadness was over, David had her brought to his house. She became his wife. And she had a son by him.

{"1": "A man and a woman from the tribe of Levi got married. ", "2": "She became pregnant and had a son by her husband. She saw that her baby was a fine child. And she hid him for three months. ", "3": "After that, she couldn't hide him any longer. So she got a basket made out of the stems of tall grass. She coated the basket with tar. She placed the child in the basket. Then she put it in the tall grass that grew along the bank of the Nile River. ", "4": "The child's sister wasn't very far away. She wanted to see what would happen to him.", "5": "Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile River to take a bath. Her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket in the tall grass. So she sent her female slave to get it. ", "6": "When she opened it, Pharaoh's daughter saw the baby. He was crying. She felt sorry for him. \u201cThis is one of the Hebrew babies,\u201d she said.", "7": "Then his sister spoke to Pharaoh's daughter. She asked, \u201cDo you want me to go and get one of the Hebrew women? She could breast-feed the baby for you.\u201d", "8": "\u201cYes. Go,\u201d she answered. So the girl went and got the baby's mother. ", "9": "Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \u201cTake this baby and feed him for me. I'll pay you.\u201d So the woman took the baby and fed him.

One day, he went out to where his own people were. He watched them while they were hard at work. He saw an Egyptian hitting a Hebrew man. The man was one of Moses' own people. ", "12": "Moses looked around and didn't see anyone. So he killed the Egyptian. Then he hid his body in the sand. ", "13": "The next day Moses went out again. He saw two Hebrew men fighting. He asked the one who had started the fight a question. He said, \u201cWhy are you hitting another Hebrew man?\u201d", "14": "The man said, \u201cWho made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking about killing me as you killed the Egyptian?\u201d Then Moses became afraid. He thought, \u201cPeople must have heard about what I did.\u201d", "15": "When Pharaoh heard about what had happened, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses escaped from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian. There he sat down by a well. ", "16": "A priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to fill the stone tubs with water.

He even got water for us and gave it to the flock.\u201d", "20": "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Reuel asked his daughters. \u201cWhy did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.\u201d", "21": "Moses agreed to stay with the man. And the man gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses to be his wife. ", "22": "Zipporah had a son by him. Moses named him Gershom. That's because Moses said, \u201cI'm an outsider in a strange land.\u201d", "23": "After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The people of Israel groaned because they were slaves. They also cried out to God. Their cry for help went up to him. ", "24": "God heard their groans.

{"1": "The time came near for David to die. So he gave orders to his son Solomon.", "2": "He said, \u201cI'm about to die, just as everyone else on earth does. So be strong. Show how brave you are. ", "3": "Do everything the Lord your God requires. Live the way he wants you to. Obey his orders and commands. Keep his laws and rules. Do everything written in the Law of Moses. Then you will have success in everything you do. You will succeed everywhere you go. ", "4": "The Lord will keep the promise he made to me. He said, 'Your sons must be careful about how they live. They must be faithful to me with all their heart and soul. Then you will always have a son from your family line to sit on the throne of Israel.'", "5": "\u201cYou yourself know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me. You know that he killed Abner, the son of Ner, and Amasa, the son of Jether. They were the two commanders of Israel's armies. He killed them in a time of peace. It wasn't a time of war. Joab spilled the blood of Abner and Amasa. With that blood he stained the belt around his waist. He also stained the sandals on his feet. ", "6": "You are wise. So I leave him in your hands. Just don't let him live to become an old man. Don't let him die peacefully.", "7": "\u201cBut be kind to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead. Provide what they need. They were faithful to me when I had to run away from your brother Absalom.", "8": "\u201cDon't forget that Shimei, the son of Gera, is still around. He's from Bahurim in the territory of Benjamin. Shimei cursed me bitterly. He did it on the day I went to Mahanaim. Later, he came down to welcome me at the Jordan River. At that time I made a promise in the name of the Lord. I promised Shimei, 'I won't put you to death with my sword.' ", "9": "But now I want you to think of him as guilty. You are wise. You will know what to do to him. Don't let him live to become an old man. Put him to death.\u201d", "10": "David joined the members of his family who had already died. He was buried in the City of David. ", "11": "He had ruled over Israel for 40 years. He ruled for seven years in Hebron. Then he ruled for 33 years in Jerusalem. ", "12": "So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David. His position as king was made secure.", "13": "Adonijah was the son of David's wife Haggith. He went to Bathsheba. She was Solomon's mother. She asked Adonijah, \u201cHave you come in peace?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes. I've come in peace.\u201d ", "14": "He continued, \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she replied.", "15": "He said, \u201cAs you know, the kingdom belonged to me. The whole nation of Israel thought of me as their king. But now things have changed. The kingdom belongs to my brother. The Lord has given it to him. ", "16": "But I have a favor to ask of you. Don't say no to me.\u201d \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said.", "17": "So he continued, \u201cPlease ask King Solomon for a favor. He won't say no to you. Ask him to give me Abishag from Shunem to be my wife.\u201d", "18": "\u201cAll right,\u201d Bathsheba replied. \u201cI'll speak to the king for you.\u201d", "19": "So Bathsheba went to King Solomon. She went to him to speak for Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her. He bowed down to her. Then he sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for his mother. She sat down at his right side.", "20": "\u201cI have one small favor to ask of you,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't say no to me.\u201d The king replied, \u201cMother, go ahead and ask. I won't say no to you.\u201d", "21": "She said, \u201cLet your brother Adonijah marry Abishag, the Shunammite.\u201d", "22": "King Solomon answered his mother, \u201cWhy are you asking me to give Abishag, the Shunammite, to Adonijah? You might as well ask me to give him the whole kingdom! After all, he's my older brother. And he doesn't want the kingdom only for himself. He also wants it for Abiathar the priest and for Joab, the son of Zeruiah.\u201d", "23": "Then King Solomon made a promise in the name of the Lord. He said, \u201cAdonijah will pay with his life because of what he has asked for. If he doesn't, may God punish me greatly. ", "24": "The Lord has made my position as king secure. I'm sitting on the throne of my father David. The Lord has built a royal house for me, just as he promised. You can be sure that the Lord lives. And you can be just as sure that Adonijah will be put to death today.\u201d ", "25": "So King Solomon gave the order to Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. Benaiah struck down Adonijah, and he died.", "26": "The king spoke to Abiathar the priest. He said, \u201cGo back to your fields in Anathoth. You should really be put to death. But I won't have it done now. That's because you carried the ark of the Lord and King. You did it for my father David. You shared all of his hard times.\u201d ", "27": "So Solomon wouldn't let Abiathar serve as a priest of the Lord anymore. That's how the message the Lord had spoken at Shiloh came true. He had spoken it about the family of Eli.", "28": "News of what Solomon had done reached Joab. Joab had never made evil plans along with Absalom. But he had joined Adonijah. So he ran to the tent of the Lord. He grabbed the horns that stuck out from the upper corners of the altar for burnt offerings. ", "29": "King Solomon was told that Joab had run to the tent. He was also told that Joab was by the altar. Then Solomon gave the order to Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. He told him, \u201cGo! Strike him down!\u201d", "30": "So Benaiah entered the tent of the Lord. He said to Joab, \u201cThe king says, 'Come on out!'\u2009\u201d But Joab answered, \u201cNo. I'd rather die here.\u201d Benaiah told the king what Joab had said to him.", "31": "Then the king commanded Benaiah, \u201cDo what he says. Strike him down and bury him. Then I and my family line won't be held accountable for the blood Joab spilled. He killed people who weren't guilty of doing anything wrong. ", "32": "The Lord will pay him back for the blood he spilled. Joab attacked two men. He killed them with his sword. And my father David didn't even know anything about it. Joab killed Abner, the son of Ner. Abner was the commander of Israel's army. Joab also killed Amasa, the son of Jether. Amasa was the commander of Judah's army. Abner and Amasa were better men than Joab is. They were more honest than he is. ", "33": "May Joab and his children after him be held forever accountable for spilling the blood of Abner and Amasa. But may David and his children after him enjoy the Lord's peace and rest forever. May the Lord also give his peace to David's royal house and kingdom forever.\u201d", "34": "So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up to the Lord's tent. There he struck down Joab. And he killed him. Joab was buried at his home out in the country. ", "35": "The king put Benaiah in charge of the army. Benaiah took Joab's place. The king also put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.", "36": "Then the king sent for Shimei. He said to him, \u201cBuild yourself a house in Jerusalem. Live there. Don't go anywhere else. ", "37": "You must not leave the city and go across the Kidron Valley. If you do, you can be sure you will die. And it will be your own fault.\u201d", "38": "Shimei replied to the king, \u201cYou are my king and master. What you say is good. I'll do it.\u201d Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.", "39": "Three years after Solomon had talked with Shimei, two of Shimei's slaves ran off. They went to Achish, the king of Gath. He was the son of Maakah. Shimei was told, \u201cYour slaves are in Gath.\u201d ", "40": "When Shimei heard that, he put a saddle on his donkey. Then he went to Achish at Gath to look for his slaves. Shimei found them and brought them back from Gath.", "41": "Solomon was told that Shimei had left Jerusalem. He was told he had gone to Gath and had returned. ", "42": "So the king sent for Shimei. He said to him, \u201cDidn't I force you to make a promise in the name of the Lord? Didn't I warn you? I said, 'You must not leave the city and go somewhere else. If you do, you can be sure you will die.' At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I'll obey your command.' ", "43": "So why didn't you keep your promise to the Lord? Why didn't you obey the command I gave you?\u201d", "44": "The king continued, \u201cYou know all the wrong things you did to my father David. In your heart you know them. Now the Lord will pay you back for what you did. ", "45": "But I will be blessed. The Lord will make David's kingdom secure forever.\u201d", "46": "Then the king gave the order to Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. Benaiah left the palace and struck down Shimei. And he died. So the kingdom was now made secure in Solomon's hands."}

She said, \u201cYou can be sure that I will kill you, just as I killed the other prophets. I'll do it by this time tomorrow. If I don't, may the gods punish me greatly.\u201d", "3": "Elijah was afraid. So he ran for his life. He came to Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there. ", "4": "Then he traveled for one day into the desert. He came to a small bush. He sat down under it. He prayed that he would die. \u201cLord, I've had enough,\u201d he said. \u201cTake my life. I'm no better than my people of long ago.\u201d ", "5": "Then he lay down under the bush. And he fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him. The angel said, \u201cGet up and eat.\u201d ", "6": "Elijah looked around. Near his head he saw some bread. It had been baked over hot coals. A jar of water was also there. So Elijah ate and drank.

He said, \u201cElijah, what are you doing here?\u201d", "10": "He replied, \u201cLord God who rules over all, I've been very committed to you. The Israelites have turned their backs on your covenant. They have torn down your altars. They've put your prophets to death with their swords. I'm the only one left. And they are trying to kill me.\u201d", "11": "The Lord said, \u201cGo out. Stand on the mountain in front of me. I am going to pass by.\u201d As the Lord approached, a very powerful wind tore the mountains apart. It broke up the rocks. But the Lord wasn't in the wind.

He was driving the last of 12 pairs of oxen. Elijah went up to him. He threw his coat around him. ", "20": "Then Elisha left his oxen. He ran after Elijah. \u201cLet me kiss my father and mother goodbye,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I'll come with you.\u201d \u201cGo back,\u201d Elijah replied. \u201cWhat have I done to you?\u201d", "21": "So Elisha left him and went back. He got his two oxen and killed them. He burned the plow to cook the meat. He gave it to the people, and they ate it. Then he started to follow Elijah. He became Elijah's servant."}

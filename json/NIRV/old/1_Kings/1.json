Please let us try to find a young virgin to serve you. She can take care of you. She can lie down beside you to keep you warm.\u201d", "3": "So David's attendants looked all over Israel for a beautiful young woman. They found Abishag. She was from the town of Shunem. They brought her to the king. ", "4": "The woman was very beautiful. She took care of the king and served him. But the king didn't have sex with her.", "5": "Adonijah was the son of David and his wife Haggith. He came forward and announced, \u201cI'm going to be the next king.\u201d So he got chariots and horses ready. He also got 50 men to run in front of him. ", "6": "His father had never tried to stop him from doing what he wanted to. His father had never asked him, \u201cWhy are you acting the way you do?\u201d Adonijah was also very handsome. Now that Absalom was dead, Adonijah was David's oldest son.", "7": "Adonijah talked things over with Joab, the son of Zeruiah. He also talked with Abiathar the priest. They agreed to help him.

Say to him, 'You are my king and master. You promised me, \u201cYou can be sure that your son Solomon will be king after me. He will sit on my throne.\u201d If that's really true, why has Adonijah become king?'

He didn't invite Zadok the priest or Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. He didn't invite your son Solomon either. ", "27": "King David, have you allowed all of that to happen? Did you do it without letting us know about it? Why didn't you tell us who is going to sit on your throne after you?\u201d", "28": "King David said, \u201cTell Bathsheba to come in.\u201d So she came and stood in front of the king.", "29": "Then the king made a promise. He said, \u201cThe Lord has saved me from all my troubles. You can be sure that he lives. ", "30": "And you can be just as sure I will do what I promised. This is the day I will do what I promised in the name of the Lord. He is the God of Israel. I promised you that your son Solomon would be king after me. He will sit on my throne in my place.\u201d", "31": "Then Bathsheba bowed down in front of the king. Her face was toward the ground. She said, \u201cKing David, you are my master. May you live forever!\u201d", "32": "King David said, \u201cTell Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet to come in. Also tell Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, to come.\u201d So they came to the king.

I've appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.\u201d", "36": "Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king. \u201cAmen!\u201d he said. \u201cMay the Lord your God make it come true.

King David, may the Lord make Solomon's kingdom even greater than yours!\u201d", "38": "So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet left the palace. Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went with them. So did the Kerethites and Pelethites. They had Solomon get on King David's mule. And they brought him down to the Gihon spring. ", "39": "Zadok the priest had taken an animal horn from the sacred tent. The horn was filled with olive oil. He anointed Solomon with the oil. A trumpet was blown.

They were filled with great joy. The ground shook because of all the noise.", "41": "Adonijah and all his guests heard it. They were just finishing their meal. Joab heard the sound of the trumpet. So he asked, \u201cWhat does all this noise in the city mean?\u201d", "42": "While Joab was still speaking, Jonathan arrived. Jonathan was the son of Abiathar the priest. Adonijah said, \u201cCome in. I have respect for you. You must be bringing good news.\u201d", "43": "\u201cNo! I'm not!\u201d Jonathan answered. \u201cOur master King David has made Solomon king.

May he make Solomon's kingdom greater than yours!' While King David was sitting on his bed, he bowed in worship. ", "48": "He said, 'I praise the Lord. He is the God of Israel. He has let me live to see my son sitting on my throne today as the next king.'\u2009\u201d", "49": "When all Adonijah's guests heard that, they were terrified. So they got up and scattered. ", "50": "Adonijah was afraid of what Solomon might do to him. So he went and grabbed the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. Those horns stuck out from its upper corners. ", "51": "Then Solomon was told, \u201cKing Solomon, Adonijah is afraid of you. He's holding onto the horns of the altar. He says, 'I want King Solomon to make a promise today. I want him to promise that he won't kill me with his sword.'\u2009\u201d", "52": "Solomon replied, \u201cLet him show that he's a man people can respect. Then not even one hair on his head will fall to the ground. But if I find out he's done something evil, he will die.\u201d ", "53": "King Solomon got some men to bring Adonijah down from the altar. He came and bowed down to King Solomon. Solomon said, \u201cGo on home.\u201d"}

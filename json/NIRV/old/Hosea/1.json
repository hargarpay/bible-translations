He was the son of Jehoash. Here is what the Lord said to him.", "2": "The Lord began to speak through Hosea. He said to him, \u201cGo. Marry a woman who has sex with anyone she wants. Have children with her. Do this because the people of the land are like that kind of wife. They have not been faithful to me.\u201d ", "3": "So Hosea married Gomer. She was the daughter of Diblaim. Gomer became pregnant and had a son by Hosea.", "4": "Then the Lord said to Hosea, \u201cName him Jezreel. That's because I will soon punish Jehu's royal family.

Then the Lord said to Hosea, \u201cName her Lo-Ruhamah.\u201d Lo-Ruhamah means Not Loved. \u201cThat's because I will no longer show love to the people of Israel. I will not forgive them anymore.

He tells them, \u201cYou have scattered my sheep. You have driven them away. You have not taken good care of them. So I will punish you for the evil things you have done,\u201d announces the Lord. ", "3": "\u201cI myself will gather together those who are left alive in my flock. I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them. And I will bring them back to their own land. There my sheep will have many lambs. There will be many more of them. ", "4": "I will place shepherds over them who will take good care of them. My sheep will not be afraid or terrified anymore.

They are not living by the truth. They strengthen the hands of those who do evil. So not one of them turns from their sinful ways. All of them are like the people of Sodom to me. They are just like the people of Gomorrah.\u201d", "15": "So the Lord who rules over all speaks about the prophets. He says, \u201cI will make them eat bitter food.

You ask, 'What is the Lord's answer?' Or you ask, 'What has the Lord spoken?' ", "36": "But you must not talk about 'a message from the Lord' again.

The people had torn down many of them. They had used their stones to strengthen the city walls against attack. ", "5": "That was during their fight with the armies of Babylon. The Lord says, \u201cThe houses will be filled with dead bodies. They will be the bodies of the people I will kill. I will kill them when I am very angry with them.

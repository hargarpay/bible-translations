They will capture it.'\u2009\u201d", "4": "Then these officials said to the king, \u201cThis man should be put to death. What he says is making the soldiers who are left in this city lose hope. It's making all the people lose hope too. He isn't interested in what is best for the people. In fact, he's trying to destroy them.\u201d", "5": "\u201cHe's in your hands,\u201d King Zedekiah answered. \u201cI can't do anything to oppose you.\u201d", "6": "So they took Jeremiah and put him into an empty well. It belonged to Malkijah. He was a member of the royal court. His well was in the courtyard of the guard. Zedekiah's men lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the well. It didn't have any water in it. All it had was mud. And Jeremiah sank down into the mud.", "7": "Ebed-Melek was an official in the royal palace. He was from the land of Cush. He heard that Jeremiah had been put into the well. The king was sitting by the Benjamin Gate at that time. ", "8": "Ebed-Melek went out of the palace.

Soon there won't be any more bread in the city. Then he'll starve to death.\u201d", "10": "So the king gave an order to Ebed-Melek the Cushite. He said, \u201cTake with you 30 men from here. Lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the well before he dies.\u201d", "11": "Then Ebed-Melek took the men with him. He went to a room in the palace. It was under the place where the treasures were stored. He got some old rags and worn-out clothes from there. Then he let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the well.

The king had him brought to the third entrance to the Lord's temple. \u201cI want to ask you something,\u201d the king said to Jeremiah. \u201cDon't hide anything from me.\u201d", "15": "Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, \u201cSuppose I give you an answer.

They are the ones who have gone over to the side of the Babylonians. The Babylonians might hand me over to them.

They'll be given to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you, \u201c\u2009'Your trusted friends have tricked you. They have gotten the best of you. Your feet are sunk down in the mud. Your friends have deserted you.'", "23": "\u201cAll your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself won't escape from them.

I don't want to die there.'\u2009\u201d", "27": "All the officials came to Jeremiah. And they questioned him. He told them everything the king had ordered him to say. None of them had heard what he told the king. So they didn't say anything else to him.", "28": "Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. He stayed there until the day Jerusalem was captured.

You must not have any sons or daughters in this land.\u201d ", "3": "Here is the Lord's message about the children born in this place. He says about them and their parents, ", "4": "\u201cSome of them will die of deadly sicknesses. No one will mourn for them. Their bodies will not be buried. Instead, they will be like human waste lying there on the ground. Others will die because of war and hunger. Their bodies will not be buried. Instead, they will become food for the birds and the wild animals.\u201d", "5": "The Lord says, \u201cJeremiah, suppose a meal is being served because someone has died. Do not enter any house where that is happening. Do not go there to mourn or to comfort the family. I will not bless these people anymore. I have taken my love and pity away from them,\u201d announces the Lord. ", "6": "\u201cImportant and unimportant people alike will die in this land. Their bodies will not be buried. No one will mourn for them. No one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. ", "7": "No one will offer food or drink to comfort those who mourn for the dead.

All of you are doing what your stubborn and evil hearts want you to do. You are not obeying me. ", "13": "So I will throw you out of this land. I will send you away to another land. Neither you nor your people of long ago have known about it. There you will serve other gods day and night.

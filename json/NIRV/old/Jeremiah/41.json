", "2": "They got up and struck down Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, with their swords. They killed him even though the king of Babylon had appointed him as governor over Judah. Ahikam was the son of Shaphan. ", "3": "Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah. And he killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there.", "4": "On the next day, people still hadn't found out that Gedaliah had been murdered. ", "5": "On that day 80 men came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards. They had torn their clothes. And they had cut themselves. They brought grain offerings and incense with them. They took them to the Lord's house. ", "6": "Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, \u201cCome to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.\u201d ", "7": "They went with him into the city. Then Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him killed them.

We've hidden all of it in a field.\u201d So he didn't kill them along with the others. ", "9": "But he had thrown into the empty well all the bodies of the men he had killed. That included Gedaliah's body. The well was the one King Asa had made. He had made it when he strengthened Mizpah against attack by Baasha, the king of Israel. Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, filled it with the bodies of those he had killed.", "10": "Nebuzaradan was the commander of the royal guard. He had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over all the people at Mizpah. But Ishmael made prisoners of the people left at Mizpah. These prisoners included women who were members of the royal court. The prisoners also included everyone else left at Mizpah. Then Ishmael started out to go across the Jordan River to the land of Ammon.", "11": "Johanan, the son of Kareah, was told what had happened. And so were all the other army officers with him. They heard about all the crimes Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had committed. ", "12": "So they brought all their men together.

They ran away to the land of Ammon.", "16": "Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, led away all the people of Mizpah who were still alive. All the other army officers with Johanan helped him do this.

The people Johanan had taken away included soldiers, women, children and court officials. He had brought them from Gibeon. ", "17": "They went on their way. They stopped at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem. They were going to Egypt. ", "18": "They wanted to get away from the Babylonians. They were afraid of them. That's because Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. The king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over Judah."}

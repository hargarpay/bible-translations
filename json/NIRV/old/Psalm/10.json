He catches weak people by making clever plans.", "3": "He brags about what his heart desires. He speaks well of those who always want more. He attacks the Lord with his words.", "4": "Because he is proud, that evil person doesn't turn to the Lord. There is no room for God in any of his thoughts.", "5": "Everything always goes well for him. So he is proud. He doesn't want to have anything to do with God's laws. He makes fun of all his enemies.", "6": "He says to himself, \u201cI will always be secure.\u201d He promises himself, \u201cNo one will ever harm me.\u201d", "7": "His mouth is full of lies and warnings.

So those who are attacked place themselves in your care. You help children whose fathers have died.", "15": "Take away the power of sinful people. Hold them accountable for the evil things they do. Uncover all the evil they have done.", "16": "The Lord is King for ever and ever. The nations will disappear from his land.", "17": "Lord, you hear the desires of those who are hurting. You cheer them up and give them hope. You listen to their cries.", "18": "You stand up for those whose fathers have died and for those who have been treated badly. You do it so that mere human beings made of dust may not terrify others anymore."}

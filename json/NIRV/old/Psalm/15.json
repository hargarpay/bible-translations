They speak the truth from their heart.", "3": "They don't tell lies about other people. They don't do wrong to their neighbors. They don't say anything bad about them.", "4": "They hate evil people. But they honor those who have respect for the Lord. They keep their promises even when it hurts. They do not change their mind.", "5": "They lend their money to poor people without charging interest.

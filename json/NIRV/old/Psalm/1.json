{"1": "Blessed is the person who obeys the law of the Lord. They don't follow the advice of evil people. They don't make a habit of doing what sinners do. They don't join those who make fun of the Lord and his law.", "2": "Instead, the law of the Lord gives them joy. They think about his law day and night.", "3": "That kind of person is like a tree that is planted near a stream of water. It always bears its fruit at the right time. Its leaves don't dry up. Everything godly people do turns out well.", "4": "Sinful people are not like that at all. They are like straw that the wind blows away.", "5": "When the Lord judges them, their life will come to an end. Sinners won't have any place among those who are godly.", "6": "The Lord watches over the lives of godly people. But the lives of sinful people will lead to their death."}

{"1": "Lord, hear me, because I ask for what is right. Listen to my cry for help. Hear my prayer. It doesn't come from lips that tell lies.", "2": "When you hand down your sentence, may it be in my favor. May your eyes see what is right.", "3": "Look deep down into my heart. Study me carefully at night and test me. You won't find anything wrong. I have planned nothing evil. My mouth has not said sinful things.", "4": "Though evil people tried to pay me to do wrong, I have not done what they wanted. Instead I have done what you commanded.", "5": "My steps have stayed on your paths. My feet have not slipped.", "6": "My God, I call out to you because you will answer me. Listen to me. Hear my prayer.", "7": "Show me the wonders of your great love. By using your great power, you save those who go to you for safety from their enemies.", "8": "Take good care of me, just as you would take care of your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings.", "9": "Save me from the sinful people who want to destroy me. Save me from my deadly enemies who are all around me.", "10": "They make their hearts hard and stubborn. Their mouths speak with pride.", "11": "They have tracked me down. They are all around me. Their eyes watch for a chance to throw me to the ground.", "12": "They are like a hungry lion, waiting to attack. They are like a powerful lion, hiding in the bushes.", "13": "Lord, rise up. Oppose them and bring them down. With your sword, save me from those evil people.", "14": "Lord, by your power save me from people like that. They belong to this world. They get their reward in this life. May what you have stored up for evil people fill their bellies. May their children's stomachs be filled with it. And may there even be leftovers for their little ones.", "15": "You will show that I am right; I will enjoy your blessing. When I wake up, I will be satisfied because I will see you."}

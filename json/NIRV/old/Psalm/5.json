With their tongues they tell lies.", "10": "God, show that they are guilty. Let their evil plans bring them down. Send them away because of their many sins. They have refused to obey you.", "11": "But let all those who go to you for safety be glad. Let them always sing for joy. Spread your cover over them and keep them safe.

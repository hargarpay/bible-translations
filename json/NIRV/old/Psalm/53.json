He wants to see if there are any who understand. He wants to see if there are any who trust in God.", "3": "All of them have turned away. They have all become evil. No one does anything good, no one at all.", "4": "Don't these people who do evil know anything? They eat up my people as if they were eating bread. They never call out to God for help.", "5": "Just look at them! They are filled with terror even when there is nothing to be afraid of! People of Israel, God scattered the bones of those who attacked you. You put them to shame, because God hated them.", "6": "How I pray that the God who saves Israel will come out of Zion! God will bless his people with great success again. Then let the people of Jacob be filled with joy! Let Israel be glad!"}

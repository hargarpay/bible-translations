", "4": "So they decided to trick the Israelites. They packed supplies as if they were going on a long trip. They loaded their donkeys with old sacks and old wineskins. The wineskins were cracked but had been mended. ", "5": "They put worn-out sandals on their feet. The sandals had been patched. They also wore old clothes. All the bread they took along was dry and moldy. ", "6": "They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal. They spoke to him and the Israelites. They said, \u201cWe've come from a country that's far away.

If you do, we can't make a peace treaty with you.\u201d", "8": "\u201cWe'll serve you,\u201d they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, \u201cWho are you? Where do you come from?\u201d", "9": "They answered, \u201cWe've come from a country that's very far away. We've come because the Lord your God is famous. We've heard reports about him.

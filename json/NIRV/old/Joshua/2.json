They stayed at the house of a prostitute. Her name was Rahab.", "2": "The king of Jericho was told, \u201cLook! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight. They've come to check out the land.\u201d ", "3": "So the king sent a message to Rahab. It said, \u201cBring out the men who came into your house. They've come to check out the whole land.\u201d", "4": "But the woman had hidden the two men. She said, \u201cIt's true that the men came here. But I didn't know where they had come from. ", "5": "They left at sunset, when it was time to close the city gate. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You might catch up with them.\u201d ", "6": "But in fact she had taken them up on the roof. There she had hidden them under some flax she had piled up. ", "7": "The king's men left to hunt down the spies. They took the road that leads to where the Jordan River can be crossed. As soon as they had gone out of the city, the gate was shut.", "8": "Rahab went up on the roof before the spies settled down for the night. ", "9": "She said to them, \u201cI know that the Lord has given you this land. We are very much afraid of you. Everyone who lives in this country is weak with fear because of you.

Then we'll be kind and faithful to you when the Lord gives us the land.\u201d", "15": "The house Rahab lived in was part of the city wall. So she let the spies down by a rope through the window. ", "16": "She said to them, \u201cGo up into the hills. The men chasing you won't be able to find you. Hide yourselves there for three days until they return.

By that time the men chasing them had searched all along the road. They couldn't find them. So they returned. ", "23": "Then the two spies started back. They went down out of the hills. They went across the Jordan River. They came to Joshua, the son of Nun. They told him everything that had happened to them. ", "24": "They said, \u201cWe're sure the Lord has given the whole land over to us. All the people there are weak with fear because of us.\u201d"}

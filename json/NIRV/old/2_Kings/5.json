{"1": "Naaman was army commander of the king of Aram. He was very important to his master and was highly respected. That's because the Lord had helped him win the battle over Aram's enemies. He was a brave soldier. But he had a skin disease.", "2": "Groups of soldiers from Aram had marched out. They had captured a young girl from Israel. She became a servant of Naaman's wife. ", "3": "The young girl spoke to the woman she was serving. She said, \u201cI wish my master would go and see the prophet who is in Samaria. He would heal my master of his skin disease.\u201d", "4": "Naaman went to see his own master. He told him what the girl from Israel had said. ", "5": "\u201cI think you should go,\u201d the king of Aram replied. \u201cI'll give you a letter to take to the king of Israel.\u201d So Naaman left. He took 750 pounds of silver with him. He also took 150 pounds of gold. And he took ten sets of clothes. ", "6": "He carried the letter to the king of Israel. It said, \u201cI'm sending my servant Naaman to you with this letter. I want you to heal him of his skin disease.\u201d", "7": "The king of Israel read the letter. As soon as he did, he tore his royal robes. He said, \u201cAm I God? Can I kill people and bring them back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be healed of his skin disease? He must be trying to pick a fight with me!\u201d", "8": "Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes. So he sent the king a message. Elisha said, \u201cWhy have you torn your robes? Tell the man to come to me. Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel.\u201d ", "9": "So Naaman went to see Elisha. He took his horses and chariots with him. He stopped at the door of Elisha's house. ", "10": "Elisha sent a messenger out to him. The messenger said, \u201cGo! Wash yourself in the Jordan River seven times. Then your skin will be healed. You will be pure and 'clean' again.\u201d", "11": "But Naaman went away angry. He said, \u201cI was sure Elisha would come out to me. I thought he would stand there and pray to the Lord his God. I thought he would wave his hand over my skin. Then I would be healed. ", "12": "And what about the Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus? Aren't they better than all the rivers of Israel? Couldn't I wash in the rivers of Damascus and be made pure and 'clean'?\u201d So he turned and went away. He was very angry.", "13": "Naaman's servants went over to him. They said, \u201cYou are like a father to us. What if Elisha the prophet had told you to do some great thing? Wouldn't you have done it? But he only said, 'Wash yourself. Then you will be pure and \u201cclean.\u201d\u2009' You should be even more willing to do that!\u201d ", "14": "So Naaman went down to the Jordan River. He dipped himself in it seven times. He did exactly what the man of God had told him to do. Then his skin was made pure again. It became \u201cclean\u201d like the skin of a young boy.", "15": "Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. Naaman stood in front of Elisha. Naaman said, \u201cNow I know that there is no God anywhere in the whole world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from me.\u201d", "16": "The prophet answered, \u201cI serve the Lord. You can be sure that he lives. And you can be just as sure that I won't accept a gift from you.\u201d Even though Naaman begged him to take it, Elisha wouldn't.", "17": "\u201cI can see that you won't accept a gift from me,\u201d said Naaman. \u201cBut please let me have some soil from your land. Give me as much as a pair of mules can carry. Here's why I want it. I won't ever bring burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god again. I'll bring them only to the Lord. I'll worship him on his own soil. ", "18": "But there is one thing I hope the Lord will forgive me for. From time to time my master will enter the temple to bow down to his god Rimmon. When he does, he'll lean on my arm. Then I'll have to bow down there also. I hope the Lord will forgive me for that.\u201d", "19": "\u201cGo in peace,\u201d Elisha said. Naaman started out on his way. ", "20": "Gehazi was the servant of Elisha, the man of God. Gehazi said to himself, \u201cMy master was too easy on Naaman from Aram. He should have accepted the gift Naaman brought. I'm going to run after him. I'm going to get something from him. And that's just as sure as the Lord is alive.\u201d", "21": "Gehazi hurried after Naaman. Naaman saw him running toward him. So he got down from the chariot to greet him. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he asked.", "22": "\u201cEverything is all right,\u201d Gehazi answered. \u201cMy master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the group of the prophets have just come to me. They've come from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothes.'\u2009\u201d", "23": "\u201cI wish you would take twice as much silver,\u201d said Naaman. He begged Gehazi to accept it. Then Naaman tied up 150 pounds of silver in two bags. He also gave Gehazi two sets of clothes. He gave all of it to two of his own servants. They carried it ahead of Gehazi. ", "24": "Gehazi came to the hill where Elisha lived. Then the servants handed the things over to Gehazi. He put them away in Elisha's house. He sent the men away, and they left. ", "25": "Then he went back inside the house. He stood in front of his master Elisha. \u201cGehazi, where have you been?\u201d Elisha asked. \u201cI didn't go anywhere,\u201d Gehazi answered.", "26": "But Elisha said to him, \u201cDidn't my spirit go with you? I know that the man got down from his chariot to greet you. Is this the time for you to accept money or clothes? Is it the time to take olive groves, vineyards, flocks or herds? Is it the time to accept male and female slaves? ", "27": "You and your children after you will have Naaman's skin disease forever.\u201d Then Gehazi left Elisha. And he had Naaman's skin disease. His skin had become as white as snow."}

He cut down the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made. Up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. They called it Nehushtan.", "5": "Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like Hezekiah among all the kings of Judah. There was no king like him either before him or after him. ", "6": "Hezekiah remained faithful to the Lord. He didn't stop serving him. He obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses.

They had refused to do everything Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded. They hadn't paid any attention to those commands. They hadn't obeyed them.", "13": "Sennacherib attacked and captured all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them. It was in the 14th year of the rule of Hezekiah.

Who are you depending on? Why don't you want to stay under my control? ", "21": "Look, I know you are depending on Egypt. Why are you doing that? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem. Try leaning on it. It will only cut your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is just like that to everyone who depends on him.

Are these words only for your master and you to hear? Aren't they also for the people sitting on the wall? They are going to suffer just like you. They'll have to eat their own waste. They'll have to drink their own urine.\u201d", "28": "Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language.

So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power?\u201d", "36": "But the people remained silent. They didn't say anything. That's because King Hezekiah had commanded, \u201cDon't answer him.\u201d", "37": "Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, went to Hezekiah. Eliakim was in charge of the palace.

", "2": "The Philistine rulers marched out in groups of hundreds and thousands. David and his men were marching with Achish behind the others. ", "3": "The commanders of the Philistines asked, \u201cWhy are these Hebrews here?\u201d Achish replied, \u201cThat's David, isn't it? Wasn't he an officer of Saul, the king of Israel? He has already been with me for more than a year. I haven't found any fault in him. That's been true from the day he left Saul until now.\u201d", "4": "But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish. They said, \u201cSend David back. Let him return to the town you gave him. He must not go with us into battle. If he does, he'll turn against us during the fighting. In fact, he might even cut off the heads of our own men.

But the Philistine commanders have said, 'We don't want David to go up with us into battle.' ", "10": "So get up early in the morning. Take with you the men who used to serve Saul. Leave as soon as the sun begins to come up.\u201d", "11": "So David and his men got up early in the morning. They went back to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."}

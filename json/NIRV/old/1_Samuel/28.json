I'll make you my own personal guard for life.\u201d", "3": "Samuel had died. The whole nation of Israel was filled with sorrow because he was dead. They had buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had thrown out of the land people who get messages from those who have died. He had also thrown out people who talk to the spirits of the dead.", "4": "The Philistines gathered together and set up camp at Shunem. At the same time, Saul gathered together all the Israelites. They set up camp at Gilboa. ", "5": "When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid. Terror filled his heart. ", "6": "He asked the Lord for advice. But the Lord didn't answer him through dreams or prophets. He didn't answer him when Saul had the priest cast lots by using the Urim. ", "7": "Saul spoke to his attendants. He said, \u201cFind me a woman who gets messages from those who have died. Then I can go and ask her some questions.\u201d \u201cThere's a woman like that in Endor,\u201d they said.", "8": "Saul put on different clothes so people wouldn't know who he was.

Why are you trying to trap me? Why do you want to have me put to death?\u201d", "10": "Saul made a promise in the name of the Lord. He said to the woman, \u201cYou can be sure that the Lord lives. And you can be just as sure that you won't be punished for helping me.\u201d", "11": "Then the woman asked, \u201cWhose spirit should I bring up for you?\u201d \u201cBring Samuel up,\u201d he said.", "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she let out a loud scream.

God has left me. He doesn't answer me anymore. He doesn't speak to me through prophets or dreams. So I've called on you to tell me what to do.\u201d", "16": "Samuel said, \u201cThe Lord has left you. He has become your enemy. So why are you asking me what you should do? ", "17": "The Lord has spoken through me and has done what he said he would do. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands. He has given it to one of your neighbors. He has given it to David. ", "18": "You didn't obey the Lord. You didn't show his great anger against the Amalekites by destroying them.

I put my own life in danger by doing what you told me to do. ", "22": "So please listen to me. Let me give you some food. Eat it. Then you will have the strength to go on your way.\u201d", "23": "But he refused. He said, \u201cI don't want anything to eat.\u201d Then his men joined the woman in begging him to eat. Finally, he paid attention to them. He got up from the ground and sat on a couch.", "24": "The woman had a fat calf at her house. She killed it at once. She got some flour. She mixed it and baked some bread that didn't have any yeast in it. ", "25": "Then she set the food in front of Saul and his men. They ate it. That same night they got up and left."}

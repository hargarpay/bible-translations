The king won't require anyone in the man's family to pay any taxes in Israel.\u201d", "26": "David spoke to the men standing near him. He asked them, \u201cWhat will be done for the man who kills this Philistine? Goliath is bringing shame on Israel. What will be done for the one who removes it? This Philistine isn't even circumcised. He dares the armies of the living God to fight him. Who does he think he is?\u201d", "27": "The men told David what Israel's soldiers had been saying. The men told him what would be done for the man who killed Goliath.", "28": "David's oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking with the men. So Eliab became very angry with him. Eliab asked David, \u201cWhy have you come down here? Who is taking care of those few sheep in the desert for you? I know how proud you are. I know how evil your heart is. The only reason you came down here was to watch the battle.\u201d", "29": "\u201cWhat have I done now?\u201d said David. \u201cCan't I even speak?\u201d ", "30": "Then he turned away to speak to some other men.

Sometimes a lion or a bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock. ", "35": "Then I would go after it and hit it. I would save the sheep it was carrying in its mouth. If it turned around to attack me, I would grab its hair. I would strike it down and kill it. ", "36": "In fact, I've killed both a lion and a bear. I'll do the same thing to this Philistine.

He took out a stone. He put it in his sling. He slung it at Goliath. The stone hit him on the forehead and sank into it. He fell to the ground on his face.", "50": "So David won the fight against Goliath with a sling and a stone. He struck down the Philistine and killed him. He did it without even using a sword.", "51": "David ran and stood over him. He picked up Goliath's sword and cut off his head with it. The Philistines saw that their hero was dead. So they turned around and ran away. ", "52": "Then the men of Israel and Judah shouted and rushed forward. They chased the Philistines to the entrance of Gath. They chased them to the gates of Ekron. Bodies of dead Philistines were scattered all along the road to Gath and Ekron. That's the road that leads to Shaaraim. ", "53": "Israel's army returned from chasing the Philistines. They had taken everything from the Philistine camp.", "54": "David picked up Goliath's head. He brought it to Jerusalem. He put Goliath's weapons in his own tent.", "55": "Saul had been watching David as he went out to meet the Philistine. He spoke to Abner, the commander of the army. Saul said to him, \u201cAbner, whose son is that young man?\u201d Abner replied, \u201cYour Majesty, I don't know. And that's just as sure as you are alive.\u201d", "56": "The king said, \u201cFind out whose son that young man is.\u201d", "57": "After David killed Goliath, he returned to the camp. Then Abner brought him to Saul. David was still carrying Goliath's head.", "58": "\u201cYoung man, whose son are you?\u201d Saul asked him. David said, \u201cI'm the son of Jesse from Bethlehem.\u201d"}

Cry out, you oak trees of Bashan! The thick forest has been cut down.", "3": "Listen to the shepherds cry out! Their rich grasslands are destroyed. Listen to the lions roar! The trees and bushes along the Jordan River are gone.", "4": "The Lord my God says, \u201cTake care of the sheep that are set apart to be sacrificed. ", "5": "Those who buy them kill them. And they are not punished for it. Those who sell them say, 'Praise the Lord! We're rich!' And their own shepherds do not spare them.

And I will not save anyone from their power.\u201d", "7": "So I took care of the sheep set apart to be sacrificed. I took special care of those that had been treated badly. Then I got two shepherd's staffs. I called one of them Favor. I called the other one Union. And I took care of the flock. ", "8": "In one month I got rid of three worthless shepherds.

So I threw the 30 silver coins to the potter at the Lord's temple.", "14": "Then I broke my second staff called Union. That broke the family connection between Judah and Israel.", "15": "The Lord said to me, \u201cNow pretend to be a foolish shepherd. Get the things you need.

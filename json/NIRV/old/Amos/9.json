Bring everything down on the heads of everyone there. I will kill with my swords those who are left alive. None of the Israelites will escape. None will get away.", "2": "They might dig down deep. But my powerful hand will take them out of there. They might climb up to the heavens. But I will bring them down from there.", "3": "They might hide on top of Mount Carmel. But I will hunt them down and grab them. They might hide from me at the bottom of the ocean. But even there I will command the serpent to bite them.", "4": "Their enemies might take them away as prisoners to another country. But there I will command Israel's enemies to cut them down with swords. I will keep my eye on Israel to harm them. I will not help them.\u201d", "5": "The Lord rules over all. The Lord touches the earth, and it melts. Everyone who lives in it mourns. The whole land rises like the Nile River. Then it settles back down again like that river in Egypt.", "6": "The Lord builds his palace high in the heavens. He lays its foundation on the earth. He sends for the waters in the clouds. Then he pours them out on the surface of the land. His name is the Lord.", "7": "\u201cYou Israelites are just like the people of Cush to me,\u201d announces the Lord. \u201cI brought Israel up from Egypt. I also brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir.", "8": "\u201cI am the Lord and King. My eyes are watching the sinful kingdom of Israel. I will wipe it off the face of the earth. But I will not totally destroy the people of Jacob,\u201d announces the Lord.", "9": "\u201cI will give an order. I will shake the people of Israel among all the nations. They will be like grain that is shaken through a screen. Not a pebble will fall to the ground.", "10": "All the sinners among my people will be killed by swords. They say, 'Nothing bad will ever happen to us.'", "11": "\u201cThe time will come when I will set up David's fallen shelter. I will repair its broken walls. I will rebuild what was destroyed. I will make it what it used to be.", "12": "Then my people will take control of those who are left alive in Edom. They will also possess all the nations that belong to me,\u201d announces the Lord. He will do all these things.", "13": "\u201cThe days are coming,\u201d announces the Lord. \u201cAt that time those who plow the land will catch up with those who harvest the crops. Those who stomp on grapes will catch up with those who plant the vines. Fresh wine will drip from the mountains. It will flow down from all the hills.", "14": "I will bring my people Israel back home. I will bless them with great success again. They will rebuild the destroyed cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink the wine they produce. They will make gardens and eat their fruit.", "15": "I will plant Israel in their own land. They will never again be removed from the land I have given them,\u201d says the Lord your God."}

The people of Israel come to you for help and advice.", "2": "Go and look at the city of Kalneh. Go from there to the great city of Hamath. Then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are those places better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours?", "3": "You are trying to avoid the time when trouble will come. But you are only bringing closer the Assyrian rule of terror.", "4": "You lie down on beds that are decorated with ivory. You rest on your couches. You eat the best lambs and the fattest calves.", "5": "You pluck away on your harps as David did. You play new songs on musical instruments.", "6": "You drink wine by the bowlful. You use the finest lotions. But Joseph's people will soon be destroyed. And you aren't even sad about it.", "7": "So you will be among the first to be taken away as prisoners.

You have turned the fruit of right living into bitterness.", "13": "You are happy because you captured the town of Lo Debar. You say, \u201cWe were strong enough to take Karnaim too.\u201d", "14": "But the Lord God rules over all. He announces, \u201cPeople of Israel, I will stir up a nation against you. They will crush you from Lebo Hamath all the way down to the Arabah Valley.\u201d"}

So be quiet!\u201d", "4": "Listen to me, you who walk all over needy people. You crush those who are poor in the land.", "5": "You say, \u201cWhen will the New Moon feast be over? Then we can sell our grain. When will the Sabbath day come to an end? Then people can buy our wheat.\u201d But you measure out less than the right amount. You raise your prices. You cheat others by using dishonest scales.", "6": "You buy poor people to make slaves out of them. You buy those who are in need for a mere pair of sandals. You even sell the worthless parts of your wheat.", "7": "People of Jacob, you are proud that the Lord is your God. But he has made a promise in his own name.

That god has led them astray. Others say, 'People of Dan, you can be sure that your god is alive.' Still others say, 'You can be sure that Beersheba's god is alive.'

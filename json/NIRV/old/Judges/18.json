{"1": "In those days Israel didn't have a king. And in those days the tribe of Dan was looking for a place where they could make their homes. They hadn't been able to take over their own share of land among the tribes of Israel. ", "2": "So the people of Dan sent out five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol. They told the men to look over the land and check it out. Those men did it for all the people of Dan. Those people told the men, \u201cGo. Check out the land.\u201d So they entered the hill country of Ephraim. They went to the house of Micah. That's where they spent the night. ", "3": "When they came near Micah's house, they recognized a voice. It was the voice of the young Levite. So they turned off the road and stopped there. They asked him, \u201cWho brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?\u201d", "4": "The Levite told them what Micah had done for him. He said, \u201cHe has hired me. I'm his priest.\u201d", "5": "Then they said to him, \u201cPlease ask God for advice. Try to find out whether we'll have success on our journey.\u201d", "6": "The priest answered them, \u201cGo in peace. The Lord is pleased with your journey.\u201d", "7": "So the five men left. They came to Laish. There they saw that the people felt secure. They were living in safety. Like the people in Sidon, they were at peace. Their land had everything they needed. Things were going very well for them. They lived a long way from the people of Sidon. And they didn't think they would ever need help from anyone else.", "8": "The men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol. Their people asked them, \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d", "9": "They answered, \u201cCome on! Let's attack them! We've seen the land, and it is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't wait any longer. Go there and take it over. ", "10": "When you get there, you will find people who aren't expecting anything bad to happen to them. Their land has plenty of room. God has handed it over to you. It's a land that has everything you will ever need.\u201d", "11": "So 600 men from the tribe of Dan started out from Zorah and Eshtaol. They were prepared for battle. ", "12": "On their way they set up camp. Their camp was near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That's why the place is called Mahaneh Dan to this day. It's west of Kiriath Jearim. ", "13": "From there they went to the hill country of Ephraim. They came to Micah's house.", "14": "Then the five men who had looked over the land of Laish spoke to the other members of their tribe. They said, \u201cDon't you know that one of these houses has a sacred linen apron in it? Some statues of family gods are there. That house also has another statue of a god covered with silver. Now you know what to do.\u201d ", "15": "So they turned off the road and stopped there. They went to the house of the young Levite. He was at Micah's place. They greeted the young man. ", "16": "The 600 men from Dan stood at the entrance of the gate. They were prepared for battle. ", "17": "The five men who had looked over the land went inside. They took the statue covered with silver. They also took the family gods and the linen apron. During that time, the priest stood at the entrance of the gate. The 600 men stood there with him. They were prepared for battle.", "18": "When the five men went into Micah's house and took all those things, the priest spoke to them. He asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "19": "They answered him, \u201cBe quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us. Be our father and priest. You can serve a whole tribe and family group in Israel as our priest. Isn't that better than serving just one man's family?\u201d ", "20": "The priest was very pleased. He took the linen apron and the family gods. He also took the statue of the god that was covered with silver. Then the priest left with the people. ", "21": "They put their little children and their livestock in front of them. They also put everything else they owned in front of them. And they turned and went on their way.", "22": "The men who lived near Micah were called together. Then they left and caught up with the people of Dan. That's because Dan's people hadn't gone very far from Micah's house. ", "23": "Those who lived near Micah shouted at them. The people of Dan turned around and asked Micah, \u201cWhat's the matter with you? Why did you call out your men to fight against us?\u201d", "24": "He replied, \u201cYou took away the gods I made. And you took away my priest. What do I have left? So how can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'\u2009\u201d", "25": "The people of Dan answered, \u201cDon't argue with us. Some of the men may get angry and attack you. Then you and your family will lose your lives.\u201d ", "26": "So the people of Dan went on their way. Micah saw that they were too strong for him. So he turned around and went back home.", "27": "The people of Dan took what Micah had made. They also took his priest. They continued on their way to Laish. They went there to fight against a people who were at peace and secure. The people of Dan struck them down with their swords. They burned down their city. ", "28": "No one could save those people and their city. They lived a long way from Sidon. And they didn't think they would ever need help from anyone else. Their city was located in a valley near Beth Rehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city. Then they made their homes there. ", "29": "They named it Dan. That's because they traced their family line back to Dan. He was a son of Israel. The city used to be called Laish. ", "30": "There the people of Dan set up for themselves the statue of the god that was covered with silver. Jonathan and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan. Jonathan was the son of Gershom, the son of Moses. Jonathan and his sons were priests until the time when the land was captured. ", "31": "The people of Dan continued to use the statue Micah had made. They used it during the whole time the house of God was in Shiloh."}

The commander of his army was Sisera. He lived in Harosheth Haggoyim. ", "3": "Jabin used 900 chariots that had some iron parts. He treated the Israelites very badly for 20 years. So they cried out to the Lord for help.", "4": "Deborah was a prophet. She was the wife of Lappidoth. She was leading Israel at that time. ", "5": "Under the Palm Tree of Deborah she served the people as their judge. That place was between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites went up to her there. They came to have her decide cases for them. She settled matters between them. ", "6": "Deborah sent for Barak. He was the son of Abinoam. Barak was from Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. Deborah said to Barak, \u201cThe Lord, the God of Israel, is giving you a command. He says, 'Go! Take 10,000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun with you. Then lead them up to Mount Tabor.

Deborah also went with him.", "11": "Heber, the Kenite, had left the other Kenites. They came from the family line of Hobab. He was the brother-in-law of Moses. Heber set up his tent by the large tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.", "12": "Sisera was told that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.

She drove the stake through his head right into the ground. So he died.", "22": "Just then Barak came by because he was chasing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him. \u201cCome right in,\u201d she said. \u201cI'll show you the man you are looking for.\u201d So he went in with her. Sisera was lying there with the stake through his head. He was dead.", "23": "On that day God brought Jabin under Israel's control. He was a king in Canaan. ", "24": "Israel's power grew stronger and stronger against King Jabin. The Israelites became so strong that they destroyed him."}

He will take the lead in saving Israel from the power of the Philistines.\u201d", "6": "Then the woman went to her husband. She told him, \u201cA man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God. His appearance was so amazing that it filled me with great wonder. I didn't ask him where he came from. And he didn't tell me his name. ", "7": "But he said to me, 'You will become pregnant. You will have a son. So do not drink any kind of wine. Do not eat anything that is \u201cunclean.\u201d That is because the boy will be a Nazirite.

I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again. He told us we would have a son. We want the man of God to teach us how to bring up the boy.\u201d", "9": "God heard Manoah.

He said, \u201cAre you the man who talked to my wife?\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d he replied.", "12": "So Manoah asked him, \u201cWhat will happen when your words come true? What rules should we follow for the boy's life and work?\u201d", "13": "The angel of the Lord answered him. He said, \u201cYour wife must do everything I have told her to do.

If he did, he wouldn't have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from us. He wouldn't have shown us all these things.

But the word they heard did not help them, because they were not unified with those who listened in faith. ", "3": "For we who have trusted are entering into that rest. It is just as God has said, \u201cSo in My wrath I swore, 'They shall never enter My rest,'\u201d[a] even though His works were finished since the foundation of the world. ", "4": "For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this way: \u201cAnd God rested on the seventh day from all His works,\u201d", "5": "[b] 5\u00a0and again in this passage: \u201cThey shall never enter My rest.\u201d[c]", "6": "So then it remains for some to enter into it; yet those who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them did not enter because of disobedience.

", "13": "No creature is hidden from Him, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.[e]", "14": "Therefore, since we have a great Kohen Gadol who has passed through the heavens, Yeshua Ben-Elohim, let us hold firmly to our confessed allegiance. ", "15": "For we do not have a kohen gadol who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all the same ways\u2014yet without sin. ", "16": "Therefore let us draw near to the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help in time of need."}

{"1": "After this there was a Jewish feast, and Yeshua went up to Jerusalem. ", "2": "Now in Jerusalem there is a pool by the sheep gate, called Bethzatha in Aramaic,[a] which has five porches. ", "3": "In these a crowd of invalids was lying around\u2014blind, lame, disabled.", "4": "(4\u00a0)[b]", "5": "Now a certain man had been an invalid there for thirty-eight years. ", "6": "Seeing him lying there and knowing he had been that way a long time, Yeshua said to him, \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d", "7": "The invalid answered Him, \u201cSir, I have nobody to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I'm trying to get in, somebody else steps down before me!\u201d", "8": "Yeshua tells him, \u201cGet up! Pick up your mat and walk!\u201d", "9": "Immediately, the man was healed! He took up his mat and started walking around. Now that day was Shabbat, ", "10": "so Judean leaders were saying to the man who was healed, \u201cIt's Shabbat! It's not permitted for you to carry your mat.\u201d", "11": "But he answered them, \u201cThe man who made me well told me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\u201d", "12": "They asked him, \u201cWho is the man who told you, 'Pick up your mat and walk'?\u201d ", "13": "But the man who had been healed didn't know who it was, for Yeshua had slipped away into the crowd in that place.", "14": "Afterwards, Yeshua finds him in the Temple. He said to him, \u201cLook, you've been healed! Stop sinning, so nothing worse happens to you.\u201d ", "15": "The man left and told the Judean leaders that it was Yeshua who had made him well.", "16": "Because Yeshua was doing these things on Shabbat, the Judean leaders started persecuting Him. ", "17": "But Yeshua said to them, \u201cMy Father is still working, and I also am working.\u201d ", "18": "So for this reason the Judean leaders kept trying even harder to kill Him\u2014because He was not only breaking Shabbat,[c] but also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.", "19": "Therefore Yeshua answered them, \u201cAmen, amen I tell you, the Son cannot do anything by Himself. He can do only what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise. ", "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He does. He will show Him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. ", "21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever He wants. ", "22": "The Father does not judge anyone, but has handed over all judgment to the Son ", "23": "so that all should honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.", "24": "\u201cAmen, amen I tell you, whoever hears My word and trusts the One who sent Me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed over from death into life. ", "25": "Amen, amen I tell you, an hour is coming and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of Ben-Elohim. Those who hear will live! ", "26": "For just as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. ", "27": "Also He has given the Son authority to judge, because He is the Son of Man.", "28": "\u201cDo not be amazed at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice ", "29": "and come out![d] Those who have done good will come to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil will come to a resurrection of judgment. ", "30": "I can do nothing on My own. Just as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, for I do not seek My own will, but the will of the One who sent Me.\u201d", "31": "\u201cIf I testify about Myself, My witness is not valid. ", "32": "There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony He gives is true. ", "33": "You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. ", "34": "I do not receive the testimony of man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. ", "35": "He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for a while in his light.", "36": "\u201cBut the testimony I have is greater than that from John. The works the Father has given Me to finish\u2014the very works I am doing\u2014testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me. ", "37": "And the Father who sent Me has testified concerning Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form. ", "38": "Nor do you have His Word living in you, because you do not trust the One He sent. ", "39": "You search the Scriptures because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. It is these that testify about Me. ", "40": "Yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life!", "41": "\u201cI do not accept glory from men. ", "42": "But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. ", "43": "I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me. But if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. ", "44": "How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that comes from God alone?", "45": "\u201cDo not think that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. ", "46": "For if you were believing Moses, you would believe Me\u2014because he wrote about Me. ", "47": "But since you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?\u201d[e]"}

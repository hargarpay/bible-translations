{"1": "As Yeshua was passing by, He saw a man who had been blind since birth. ", "2": "His disciples asked Him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?\u201d", "3": "Yeshua answered, \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that the works of God might be brought to light in him. ", "4": "We must do the work of the One who sent Me, so long as it is day! Night is coming when no one can work. ", "5": "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u201d", "6": "Having said these things, He spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud on the blind man's eyes. ", "7": "He told him, \u201cGo, wash in the Pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.", "8": "Therefore his neighbors and those who had seen him as a beggar kept saying, \u201cIsn't this the one who used to sit and beg?\u201d", "9": "\u201cThis is the one!\u201d some said. \u201cNo, but it looks like him,\u201d said others. But the man himself kept saying, \u201cI am!\u201d", "10": "So they asked him, \u201cThen how were your eyes opened?\u201d", "11": "He answered, \u201cThe Man who is called Yeshua made mud, rubbed it on my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went away and washed, and then I received my sight!\u201d", "12": "\u201cWhere is He?\u201d they asked him. \u201cI don't know,\u201d he said.", "13": "They bring to the Pharisees the man who once was blind. ", "14": "Now the day was Shabbat when Yeshua made the mud and opened the man's eyes. ", "15": "So again the Pharisees were asking him how he received his sight. He responded, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see!\u201d", "16": "So some of the Pharisees began saying, \u201cThis man isn't from God, because He doesn't keep Shabbat!\u201d But others were saying, \u201cHow can a sinner perform such signs?\u201d So there was a split among them.", "17": "Again they say to the blind man, \u201cWhat do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?\u201d And he said, \u201cHe's a prophet.\u201d", "18": "So the Judean leaders didn't believe that he had been blind and received his sight until they called his parents. ", "19": "They questioned them, \u201cIs this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he see now?\u201d", "20": "Then his parents answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son and that he was born blind. ", "21": "We don't know how he now sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him\u2014he's old enough. He will speak for himself.\u201d ", "22": "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Judean leaders. For the Judean leaders had already agreed that anyone who professed Yeshua to be Messiah would be thrown out of the synagogue. ", "23": "That's why his parents said, \u201cHe's old enough\u2014ask him.\u201d", "24": "So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said, \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!\u201d", "25": "The man replied, \u201cI don't know whether He's a sinner. One thing I do know is that I was blind, but now I see!\u201d", "26": "So they asked him, \u201cWhat did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d", "27": "\u201cI told you already and you didn't listen!\u201d the man responded. \u201cWhat, do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become His disciples too, do you?\u201d", "28": "They railed at him and said, \u201cYou're a disciple of that One, but we're disciples of Moses! ", "29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this fellow, we don't know where He is from.\u201d", "30": "The man replied to them, \u201cThat's amazing! You don't know where He is from, yet He opened my eyes! ", "31": "We know that God doesn't listen to sinners; but if anyone fears Him and does His will, He hears this one. ", "32": "Since the beginning of the world, no one has ever heard that anyone has opened the eyes of a man born blind. ", "33": "If this man were not from God, He couldn't do anything.\u201d", "34": "They replied to him, \u201cYou were born completely in sin, and you're teaching us?\u201d And they threw him out.", "35": "Yeshua heard that they had thrown him out. Finding him, He said, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d[a]", "36": "The man answered, \u201cWho is He, Sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in Him!\u201d", "37": "Yeshua said, \u201cYou have seen Him\u2014He is the One speaking with you.\u201d", "38": "He said, \u201cLord, I believe!\u201d And he worshiped Him.", "39": "Yeshua said, \u201cFor judgment I came into this world, so that those who don't see may see, and the ones who do see may become blind.\u201d", "40": "Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard Him say this and asked, \u201cWe're not blind too, are we?\u201d", "41": "Yeshua said to them, \u201cIf you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, 'We see.' So your sin remains.\u201d"}

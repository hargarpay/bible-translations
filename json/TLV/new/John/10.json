", "2": "But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. ", "3": "To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice. The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.", "4": "\u201cWhen he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them; and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. ", "5": "They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ", "6": "Yeshua told them this parable, but they did not understand what He was telling them.", "7": "So Yeshua said again, \u201cAmen, amen I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.

Why listen to Him?\u201d ", "21": "Others said, \u201cThese are not the sayings of someone who is plagued by a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?\u201d", "22": "Then came Hanukkah;[c] it was winter in Jerusalem. ", "23": "Yeshua was walking in the Temple around Solomon's Colonnade.

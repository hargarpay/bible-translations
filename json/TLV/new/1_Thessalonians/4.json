", "3": "For this is the will of God\u2014your sanctification:[b] to abstain from sexual immorality;", "4": "to know, each of you, how to gain control over his own body[c] in holiness and honor\u2014", "5": "not in the passion of lust like the pagans who do not know God;", "6": "and not to overstep his brother and take advantage of him in this matter\u2014 because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, as we told you before and solemnly warned you.

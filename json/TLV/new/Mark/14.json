Breaking open the jar, she poured it over His head. ", "4": "But some got angry and said among themselves, \u201cWhy was this fragrant oil wasted? ", "5": "It could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor!\u201d And they kept scolding her.", "6": "But Yeshua said, \u201cLeave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She's done Me a mitzvah. ", "7": "For you always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want; but you won't always have Me. ", "8": "She did what she could\u2014she came beforehand to anoint My body for burial. ", "9": "Amen, I tell you, wherever the Good News is proclaimed in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d", "10": "Then Judah from Kriot, one of the Twelve, went out to the ruling kohanim to betray Yeshua to them. ", "11": "They were delighted when they heard this and promised to give him money. And Judah began looking for a chance to hand Him over.", "12": "Now on the first day of matzah, when they were slaughtering the Passover lamb, Yeshua's disciples say to Him, \u201cWhere do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?\u201d", "13": "He sends two of His disciples and tells them, \u201cGo into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, ", "14": "and wherever he enters, tell the homeowner, 'The Teacher says, \u201cWhere is My guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d' ", "15": "He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u201d", "16": "The disciples went out, came to the city, and found just what Yeshua had told them. And they prepared the Passover. ", "17": "When it was evening, He came with the Twelve. ", "18": "As they were reclining and eating, Yeshua said, \u201cAmen, I tell you, one of you who is eating with Me will betray Me.\u201d", "19": "They began to be sorrowful and to say to Him one by one, \u201cI'm not the one, am I?\u201d", "20": "He said to them, \u201cIt's one of the Twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl.", "21": "[a] 21\u00a0For the Son of Man indeed goes, just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!\u201d", "22": "And while they were eating, He took matzah;[b] and after He offered the bracha, He broke it and gave it to them and said, \u201cTake; this is My body.\u201d ", "23": "And He took a cup; and after giving thanks, He gave to them and they all drank from it.

", "34": "And He tells them, \u201cMy soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.\u201d", "35": "Going a little farther, He fell to the ground and began praying that if possible this hour might pass Him by.

", "40": "And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy. They didn't know what to answer Him. ", "41": "And He comes the third time and says to them, \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners. ", "42": "Get up, let's go! Look, My betrayer is near.\u201d", "43": "Right away, while Yeshua was still speaking, Judah comes up, one of the Twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the ruling kohanim, Torah scholars, and elders. ", "44": "Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, \u201cThe One I kiss, He's the One!

", "54": "Peter had followed Him from a distance, right into the courtyard of the kohen gadol. He was sitting with the guards, warming himself by the fire.", "55": "Now the ruling kohanim and all the Sanhedrin kept trying to get evidence against Yeshua so they could put Him to death, but they weren't finding any.

What is this they're testifying against You?\u201d", "61": "But keeping silent, Yeshua did not answer. Again the kohen gadol questioned Him, \u201cAre you Mashiach, Son of the Blessed One?\u201d[i]", "62": "\u201cI am,\u201d said Yeshua, \u201cand you shall see 'the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Powerful One,' and 'coming with the clouds of heaven'!\u201d[j]", "63": "Tearing his clothes, the kohen gadol says, \u201cWhy do we still need witnesses? ", "64": "You've heard the blasphemy. What seems right to you?\u201d Then all condemned Him as deserving death. ", "65": "Some began to spit on Him, to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, saying, \u201cProphesy!\u201d Also the guards slapped Him around.", "66": "As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the kohen gadol comes by. ", "67": "Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked straight at him. \u201cYou also were with Yeshua of Natzeret,\u201d she says.", "68": "But he denied it, saying, \u201cI don't know or understand what you're talking about!\u201d Then he went outside to the gateway, and a rooster crowed.", "69": "Seeing him, the servant girl began again to tell the bystanders, \u201cThis is one of them.\u201d", "70": "But again he denied it. And a little while later, the bystanders were again saying to Peter, \u201cSurely you're one of them, for you're also a Galilean.\u201d", "71": "But he began to curse himself and to swear an oath: \u201cI do not know this Man you're talking about!\u201d ", "72": "Right then, a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter called to mind the word Yeshua had said to him: \u201cBefore a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.\u201d And he broke down and began to weep."}

{"1": "Now the Pharisees and some of the Torah scholars who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Yeshua. ", "2": "And they saw that some of His disciples were eating bread with unclean hands, that is, not washed. ", "3": "(For the Pharisees and all Jewish people do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow, keeping the tradition of the elders. ", "4": "And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing.[a] There are many other traditions they have received and hold, such as the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels.)[b]", "5": "The Pharisees and Torah scholars questioned Yeshua, \u201cWhy don't Your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders? Why do they eat bread with unwashed hands?\u201d", "6": "And He said to them, \u201cRightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors Me with their lips but their heart is far from Me.", "7": "And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'[c]", "8": "Having left behind the commandment of God, you hold on to the tradition of men.\u201d", "9": "He was also telling them, \u201cYou set aside the commands of God, in order that you may validate your own tradition. ", "10": "For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.'", "11": "[d] 11\u00a0But you say if anyone tells his father or mother, 'Whatever you might have gained from me is korban (that is, an offering to God),' ", "12": "then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, ", "13": "making void the word of God with your tradition that you've handed down. And you do many such things.\u201d[e]", "14": "Then Yeshua called the crowd again and began saying to them, \u201cHear Me, everyone, and understand.

{"1": "Now as they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, Yeshua sends two of His disciples ", "2": "and says to them, \u201cGo into the village ahead of you. Right away as you enter it, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat upon.[a] Untie it and bring it. ", "3": "If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Master needs it.' And right away he will send it back here.\u201d[b]", "4": "They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a door. And they untied it. ", "5": "Some people standing there began saying to them, \u201cWhat are you doing, untying the colt?\u201d", "6": "They answered just as Yeshua had told them, and the people let them go. ", "7": "And they brought the colt to Yeshua and laid their cloaks on it, and He sat on it. ", "8": "Many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread branches cut from the fields.", "9": "[c] 9\u00a0Those going before and those following kept shouting, \u201cHoshia-na! Baruch ha-ba b'shem Adonai! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!", "10": "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hoshia-na in the highest!\u201d[d]", "11": "And He entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After looking around at everything, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve, since it was already late.", "12": "The next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry. ", "13": "Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if He would find any fruit on it. When He came up to it, He found nothing except leaves, because it wasn't the season for figs.

He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those selling doves, ", "16": "and He wouldn't let anyone carry goods through the Temple. ", "17": "And He began to teach them, saying, \u201cIs it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'?[e] But you have made it a 'den of thieves.'\u201d[f]", "18": "The ruling kohanim and Torah scholars heard this and began looking for a way to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching. ", "19": "Whenever evening came, Yeshua and His disciples would leave the city.", "20": "As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree shriveled from the roots. ", "21": "Peter remembered and said to Yeshua, \u201cRabbi, look! The fig tree You cursed has shriveled up!\u201d", "22": "And Yeshua answered, saying to them, \u201cHave faith in God!

", "6": "But from the beginning of creation, God 'made them male and female. ", "7": "For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, ", "8": "and the two shall become one flesh.'[b] So they are no longer two, but one flesh. ", "9": "Therefore what God has joined together, let no man separate!\u201d", "10": "In the house, the disciples began questioning Him about this again. ", "11": "And He said to them, \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. ", "12": "And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she is committing adultery.\u201d", "13": "Now people were bringing little children to Yeshua so He might touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.

He leased it to some tenant farmers and went on a journey. ", "2": "And at the season, he sent a servant to collect from the tenants part of the vineyard's fruit. ", "3": "But grabbing him, they beat him up and sent him away empty-handed. ", "4": "And again the man sent another servant to them, and they wounded his head and treated him shamefully. ", "5": "He sent another, and that one they killed; and so on with many others, beating some and killing some. ", "6": "He had yet one, a well-loved son. He sent him to them last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'", "7": "\u201cBut those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir! Come on, let's kill him and the inheritance will be ours!'

But they feared the crowd, so they left Him and went away.", "13": "Then they send some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Yeshua in order to trap Him with a word. ", "14": "They come and say to Him, \u201cTeacher, we know that You are honest, and what others think doesn't concern You. You don't look at men's appearance, but teach the way of God according to the truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? ", "15": "Should we pay, or shouldn't we?\u201d But Yeshua saw through their hypocrisy and said to them, \u201cWhy are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius so I may see it.\u201d", "16": "They brought one. And He said to them, \u201cWhose image is this? And whose inscription?\u201d \u201cCaesar's,\u201d they said to Him.", "17": "Then Yeshua said to them, \u201cGive to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\u201d And they were completely amazed at Him.", "18": "Then Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came and began questioning Yeshua, saying, ", "19": "\u201cTeacher, Moses wrote for us that 'if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother should take the widow and father children for his brother.'", "20": "[b] 20\u00a0There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and, when he died, left no offspring.

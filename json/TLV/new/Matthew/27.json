Feeling remorse, he brought the thirty silver pieces back to the ruling kohanim and elders, ", "4": "saying, \u201cI've sinned, betraying innocent blood!\u201d But they said, \u201cWhat's that to us? You see to it yourself!\u201d ", "5": "After tossing the silver into the Temple sanctuary, he left. Then he went off and hanged himself. ", "6": "But the ruling kohanim took the silver pieces and said, \u201cIt is not permitted to put these in the treasury, since it is blood money.\u201d ", "7": "So after they conferred, they bought with them the potter's field, as a cemetery for strangers. ", "8": "For this reason that field has been called the \u201cField of Blood\u201d to this day.

The governor questioned Him, saying, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d \u201cYou say so,\u201d Yeshua said. ", "12": "And while He was accused by the ruling kohanim and elders, He did not answer.", "13": "Then Pilate said to Him, \u201cDon't You hear how many things they testify against you?\u201d ", "14": "Yeshua did not answer, not even one word, so the governor was greatly amazed.", "15": "Now during the feast, the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner, anyone they wanted.

What evil has He done?\u201d But they kept shouting all the more, saying, \u201cLet Him be executed!\u201d", "24": "When Pilate saw he was accomplishing nothing, but instead a riot was starting, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \u201cI am innocent of this blood,\u201d[c] he said. \u201cYou see to it yourselves!\u201d", "25": "All the people answered and said, \u201cHis blood be on us and on our children!\u201d[d]", "26": "Then he released to them Bar-Abba. And after he had Yeshua scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.", "27": "Then the governor's soldiers took Yeshua into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around Him. ", "28": "They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him. ", "29": "And after braiding a crown of thorns, they placed it on His head and put a staff in His right hand. And falling on their knees before Him, they mocked Him, saying, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d ", "30": "They spat on Him, and they took the staff and beat Him over and over on the head. ", "31": "When they finished mocking Him, they stripped the robe off Him and put His own clothes back on Him.

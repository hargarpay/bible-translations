As it is written, \u201cFor this reason I will give You praise among the Gentiles, and I will sing to Your name.\u201d[c]", "10": "And again it says, \u201cRejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.\u201d[d]", "11": "And again, \u201cPraise Adonai all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise Him.\u201d[e]", "12": "And again, Isaiah says, \u201cThere shall be a shoot of Jesse; and the One who arises to rule the Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles hope.\u201d[f]", "13": "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and shalom in trusting, so you may overflow with hope in the power of the Ruach ha-Kodesh.", "14": "Now I myself am convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and also able to counsel one another.

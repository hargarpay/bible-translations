{"1": "Now there were some present at the same time who told Yeshua about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. ", "2": "He answered and said to them, \u201cDo you suppose that these Galileans are worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered these things? ", "3": "No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you all will perish the same way.", "4": "\u201cOr those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and were killed, do you suppose that they are worse sinners than all the people living in Jerusalem? ", "5": "No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you all will perish the same way.", "6": "Then Yeshua began telling this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree he had planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. ", "7": "So he said to the gardener, 'Indeed, for three years I've come searching for fruit on this fig tree and found none. Remove it! Why does it use up the ground?'", "8": "\u201cBut answering, the gardener said to him, 'Master, leave it alone for this year also, until I dig around it and apply fertilizer. ", "9": "And if it bears fruit, good. But if not, cut it down.'\u201d", "10": "Now Yeshua was teaching in one of the synagogues on Shabbat. ", "11": "And behold, there was a woman with a disabling spirit for eighteen years, bent over and completely unable to stand up straight. ", "12": "When Yeshua saw her, He called out to her and said, \u201cWoman, you are set free from your disability.\u201d ", "13": "Then He laid hands on her, and instantly she stood up straight and began praising God.", "14": "But the synagogue leader, indignant that Yeshua had healed on Shabbat, started telling the crowd, \u201cThere are six days in which work should be done[a]\u2014so come to be healed on those days and not on Yom Shabbat!\u201d", "15": "But the Lord answered him and said, \u201cHypocrites! On Shabbat doesn't each of you untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it drink?

To what shall I compare it? ", "19": "It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and dropped into his own garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.\u201d", "20": "[c] 20\u00a0Again He said, \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God? ", "21": "It is like hametz, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.", "22": "And He continued on His journey through the towns and villages, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem. ", "23": "And someone said to Him, \u201cMaster, are only a few being saved?\u201d Then Yeshua said to them, ", "24": "\u201cMake every effort to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able. ", "25": "Once the Master of the household gets up and shuts the door, and you're standing outside and begin knocking on the door, saying, 'Master, open up for us,' then He will say to you, 'I don't know where you come from.'

{"1": "Now the Feast of Matzah, which is called Passover, was approaching.

", "4": "And he went away and talked with the ruling kohanim and officers of the Temple guard about how he might deliver Yeshua over to them. ", "5": "They were delighted and agreed to give him money. ", "6": "So he agreed and began looking for a chance to hand Yeshua over to them without a crowd.", "7": "Then came the day of matzah when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. ", "8": "Now Yeshua sent Peter and John, saying, \u201cGo and prepare the Passover for us, so we may eat.\u201d", "9": "Then they said to Him, \u201cWhere do You want us to prepare?\u201d", "10": "And He said to them, \u201cBehold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters.

Two swords!\u201d And He said to them, \u201cIt is enough.\u201d", "39": "And Yeshua came out and went as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.

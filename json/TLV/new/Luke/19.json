{"1": "Now Yeshua entered Jericho and was passing through. ", "2": "And here was a man by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. ", "3": "Zacchaeus was trying to see who Yeshua was, but he couldn't because of the crowd, for he was short in height. ", "4": "So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Yeshua, for He was about to pass through that way.", "5": "When Yeshua came to the place, He looked up and said to him, \u201cZacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.\u201d", "6": "Zacchaeus hurried and came down and welcomed Him joyfully.", "7": "But when everyone saw it, they began to grumble, saying, \u201cYeshua has gone to be the guest of a sinner!\u201d", "8": "But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord. \u201cLook, Master, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have somehow cheated anyone, I repay four times as much!\u201d[a]", "9": "Then Yeshua said to him, \u201cToday salvation has come to this home, because he also is a son of Abraham. ", "10": "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\u201d", "11": "As they were listening to this, Yeshua went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was about to appear at once. ", "12": "Therefore He said, \u201cA certain nobleman went to a faraway land to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. ", "13": "And calling ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas[b] and said to them, 'Do business until I come back.'

Because you were faithful with so little, take charge over ten cities.' ", "18": "Also, the second slave came, saying, 'Your mina, Master, made five.' ", "19": "Then he also said to this one, 'You are likewise over five cities.' ", "20": "But another came, saying, 'Master, here is your mina. I was keeping it safe in a handkerchief, ", "21": "for I was afraid of you because you are a strict man. You take what you did not make and reap what you did not sow.' ", "22": "He said to him, 'By the words of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked slave! You knew that I am strict, taking what I did not make and reaping what I did not sow? ", "23": "Then why didn't you put my money in the bank, so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest?' ", "24": "Then to the bystanders he said, 'Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten minas.' ", "25": "But they said to him, 'Sir, he has ten minas!'

", "29": "When He got near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives,[c] He sent two of the disciples, ", "30": "saying, \u201cGo into the village ahead. As you enter, you will find a colt tied up, that no one has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it. ", "31": "And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say, 'The Master needs it.'\u201d", "32": "Those who were headed out found things just as He told them. ", "33": "Then as they were untying the colt, his owners said to them, \u201cWhy are you untying the colt?\u201d", "34": "They said, \u201cThe Master needs it.\u201d ", "35": "Then they brought it to Yeshua, threw their cloaks[d] on the colt, and set Yeshua on it.", "36": "[e] 36\u00a0And as He went along, the people were spreading their cloaks on the road.", "37": "[f] 37\u00a0When Yeshua came near the slope of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice.

And they won't leave within you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.\u201d", "45": "Then Yeshua entered the Temple and began to drive out the merchants, ", "46": "saying to them, \u201cIt is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,'[j] but you have made it a 'den of thieves.'\u201d[k]", "47": "And He was teaching every day in the Temple. The ruling kohanim and the Torah scholars, even the leaders of the people, were trying to destroy Him; ", "48": "but they could not find any way to do it, because all the people were hanging on His words."}

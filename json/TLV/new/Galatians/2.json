", "2": "Because of a revelation, I went up and presented to them the Good News that I proclaim among the Gentiles. But I did so privately to those who seemed to be influential, to make sure I would not run\u2014or had not run\u2014in vain.", "3": "[a] 3\u00a0Yet not even Titus who was with me, a Greek, was forced to be circumcised.

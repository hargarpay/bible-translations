{"1": "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught doing something wrong, you who are directed by the Ruach, restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness\u2014looking closely at yourself so you are not tempted also. ", "2": "Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you fulfill the Torah of Messiah. ", "3": "For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is fooling himself. ", "4": "Rather let each one examine his own work. Then he will have pride in himself alone and not in comparison to anyone else. ", "5": "For each one will carry his own load.", "6": "Now let the one who is taught the word share all good things with his teacher. ", "7": "Do not be deceived\u2014God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he also shall reap. ", "8": "For the one who sows in the flesh will reap corruption from the flesh.[a] But the one who sows in the Ruach will reap from the Ruach eternal life. ", "9": "So let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we don't give up. ", "10": "Therefore, whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good toward all[b]\u2014especially those who belong to the household of faith.", "11": "Notice the large letters\u2014I am writing to you with my own hand. ", "12": "Those wanting to look good outwardly[c] are trying to force you to be circumcised\u2014only so they will not be persecuted for the cross of Messiah. ", "13": "For not even the circumcised keep Torah themselves. Yet they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh. ", "14": "But may I never boast\u2014except in the cross of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah. Through Him the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. ", "15": "For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means[d] anything\u2014but only a new creation. ", "16": "Now as many as live by this rule[e]\u2014shalom and mercy on them and on the Israel of God.", "17": "From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I bear on my body the scars[f] of Yeshua.", "18": "The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen."}

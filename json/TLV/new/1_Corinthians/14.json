", "5": "Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy.[a] One who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues\u2014unless he interprets, so that the community may be built up.", "6": "But now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you\u2014unless I speak to you by way of revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? ", "7": "It is the same for lifeless things that make a sound\u2014like a flute or a harp. If they make no distinction in the tones, how will what is played be recognized?

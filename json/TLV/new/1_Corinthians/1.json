", "9": "God is faithful,[a] through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Yeshua the Messiah our Lord.", "10": "Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, through the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same purpose.

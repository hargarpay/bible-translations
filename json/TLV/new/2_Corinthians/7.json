{"1": "Therefore, since we have these promises, loved ones, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.", "2": "Make room for us in your hearts. We wronged no one, ruined no one, took advantage of no one. ", "3": "I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts\u2014to die together and to live together with you. ", "4": "Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I have been filled with encouragement. I overflow with joy in all our troubles.", "5": "For even when we came into Macedonia, our body had no rest. But we were hard pressed on every side\u2014conflicts outside, fears within. ", "6": "But God, who encourages the downcast, encouraged us with the arrival of Titus; ", "7": "and not only by his coming, but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your deep concern for me\u2014so that I rejoiced still more.", "8": "For even if I grieved you with my letter, I do not regret it\u2014though I did regret it, for I see that my letter grieved you, but just for a while. ", "9": "Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to the point of repentance. For you were grieved according to God's will, so that you might in no way suffer loss from us. ", "10": "For the grief that God wills brings a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret. But the world's grief brings death. ", "11": "For see what this very thing\u2014this grieving that God wills\u2014has brought you! What diligence, what defense, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what rendering of justice! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. ", "12": "So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for the sake of the wrongdoer or for the sake of the one who was wronged, but to make known to you your diligence for us in the sight of God. ", "13": "For this reason we have been encouraged. Besides our own encouragement, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. ", "14": "For if I have boasted some to him about you, I was not put to shame. But as we spoke all things truthfully to you, so also our boasting to Titus has proved to be the truth. ", "15": "His feelings toward you overflow when he remembers everyone's obedience\u2014how you received him with fear and trembling. ", "16": "I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you."}

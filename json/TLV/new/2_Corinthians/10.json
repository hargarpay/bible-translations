", "2": "I beg of you that when I am present I won't need to be bold with the courage I consider showing against some who judge us as walking in the flesh. ", "3": "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh. ", "4": "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful through God for the tearing down of strongholds.[a] We are tearing down false arguments ", "5": "and every high-minded thing that exalts itself[b] against the knowledge of God. We are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Messiah\u2014", "6": "ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.", "7": "Look at what is before your eyes.[c] If anyone is confident in himself that he belongs to Messiah, let him reconsider that just as he belongs to Messiah, so also do we.

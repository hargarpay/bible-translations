{"1": "For this reason, since we have this ministry, just as we received mercy, we do not lose heart. ", "2": "Instead, we renounced the hidden shameful ways\u2014not walking in deception or distorting the word of God, but commending ourselves before God to everyone's conscience by the open proclamation of the truth. ", "3": "And even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. ", "4": "In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so they might not see the light of the Good News of the glory of Messiah, who is the image of God. ", "5": "For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Messiah Yeshua as Lord\u2014and ourselves as your slaves for Yeshua's sake. ", "6": "For God, who said, \u201cLet light shine out of darkness,\u201d[a] is the One who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Messiah.[b]", "7": "But we have this treasure in jars of clay,[c] so that the surpassing greatness of the power may be from God and not from ourselves. ", "8": "We are hard pressed in every way, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not in despair; ", "9": "persecuted, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed; ", "10": "always carrying in the body the death of Yeshua, so that the life of Yeshua may also be revealed in our mortal body.

", "15": "For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace that is spreading through more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow\u2014to the glory of God.", "16": "Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.", "17": "[e] 17\u00a0For our trouble, light and momentary, is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, ", "18": "as we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen. For what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal."}

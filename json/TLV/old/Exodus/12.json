", "4": "But if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor are to take one according to the number of the people. According to each person eating, you are to make your count for the lamb. ", "5": "Your lamb is to be without blemish, a year old male.[a] You may take it from the sheep or from the goats. ", "6": "You must watch over it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight.", "7": "[b] 7\u00a0They are to take the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the crossbeam of the houses where they will eat it.

Whatever remains until the morning you are to burn with fire. ", "11": "Also you are to eat it this way: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in haste. It is Adonai's Passover.", "12": "\u201cFor I will go through the land of Egypt on that night and strike down every firstborn, both men and animals, and I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am Adonai. ", "13": "The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are.[d] When I see the blood, I will pass over you. So there will be no plague among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.", "14": "\u201cThis day is to be a memorial for you.[e] You are to keep it as a feast to Adonai. Throughout your generations you are to keep it as an eternal ordinance.

", "27": "You are to say, 'It is the sacrifice of Adonai's Passover, because He passed over the houses of Bnei-Yisrael in Egypt, when He struck down the Egyptians, but spared our households.'\u201d So the people bowed their heads and worshipped.", "28": "Then Bnei-Yisrael went and did it. They did just as Adonai had commanded Moses and Aaron. ", "29": "So it came about at midnight that Adonai struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn cattle.[h]", "30": "Then Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt. For there was not a house where someone was not dead. ", "31": "So he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, \u201cRise up, go out from my people, both you and Bnei-Yisrael, go, serve Adonai as you have said. ", "32": "Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone! But bless me, too.\u201d", "33": "Now the Egyptians urged the people, sending them out of the land quickly, for they thought, \u201cWe will all be dead!\u201d ", "34": "So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. ", "35": "So Bnei-Yisrael acted according to the word of Moses. They asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing. ", "36": "Adonai gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians and let them have what they asked for. So they plundered the Egyptians.", "37": "Then Bnei-Yisrael journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot, as well as children. ", "38": "Also a mixed multitude went up with them, along with the flocks, herds and heavy livestock. ", "39": "They had baked matzot cakes from the dough that they brought out of Egypt. It had no hametz, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not delay, so they had not made provisions for themselves.", "40": "Now the time that Bnei-Yisrael lived in Egypt was 430 years. ", "41": "So it happened at the end of 430 years, to the very day, that all the armies of Adonai went out from the land of Egypt. ", "42": "It was a night of watching for Adonai to bring them out of the land of Egypt. This same night is a night of vigil for Adonai, for all Bnei-Yisrael throughout their generations.", "43": "Then Adonai said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cThis is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner may eat it, ", "44": "but every man's servant that is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. ", "45": "Nor should a visitor or hired servant eat it. ", "46": "It is to be eaten inside a single house. You are not to carry the meat out of the house, nor are you to break any of its bones.", "47": "[i] 47\u00a0All the congregation of Israel must keep it. ", "48": "But if an outsider dwells with you, who would keep the Passover for Adonai, all his males must be circumcised. Then let him draw near and keep it. He will be like one who is native to the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat from it.

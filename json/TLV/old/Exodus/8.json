", "3": "But the magicians did the same with their secret arts and brought up frogs over the land of Egypt.", "4": "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, \u201cPray to Adonai, that He would take the frogs away from me and from my people. Then I will let the people go, so they may sacrifice to Adonai.\u201d", "5": "Moses answered Pharaoh, \u201cBoast about me after I pray for you. When am I to pray for you, your servants and your people, that the frogs would be cut off from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile?\u201d", "6": "\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said. So he said, \u201cLet it happen according to your word, so that you may know that there is none like Adonai our God.

", "11": "But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them\u2014just as Adonai had said.", "12": "So Adonai said to Moses, \u201cTell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and it will become gnats[a] throughout all the land of Egypt.'\u201d ", "13": "So they did. When Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, there were gnats on men and animals. All the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.", "14": "When the magicians attempted the same with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, they could not. There were gnats on men and animals.

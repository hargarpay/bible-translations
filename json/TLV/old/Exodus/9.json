There will be a crushing plague. ", "4": "But Adonai will make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and nothing will die that belongs to Bnei-Yisrael.\u201d", "5": "Also Adonai set a specific time, saying, \u201cTomorrow Adonai will do this thing in the land.\u201d", "6": "Then the next day, Adonai did the deed. All the cattle of Egypt died, yet of the cattle of Bnei-Yisrael, not one died. ", "7": "When Pharaoh inquired, there was not so much as one of the cattle of Bnei-Yisrael dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.", "8": "Then Adonai said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cTake handfuls of soot from the furnace, and have Moses throw it heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh.

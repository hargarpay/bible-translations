", "3": "It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers, which were on 45 pillars\u201415 in a row. ", "4": "And there were window frames in three rows, with window opposite window in three ranks. ", "5": "And all the doorways had rectangular frame, and with window opposite to window in three tiers.", "6": "He also made a portico of columns, 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide, with a porch in front, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. ", "7": "He also made the Hall of the Throne where he would judge\u2014the Hall of Justice. It was paneled with cedar from the floor to the ceiling.", "8": "His house where he would dwell, set farther back of the hall, was of the same construction. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife.", "9": "All these were made of expensive stones\u2014stone cut to size and sawed with saws inside and outside\u2014from the foundation to the top and from the outside to the great court.

{"1": "Now it was after many days that the word of Adonai came to Elijah in the third year saying, \u201cGo, show yourself to Ahab; then I will send rain on the land. ", "2": "So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. ", "3": "Ahab summoned Obadiah who was the steward of the palace. Now Obadiah feared Adonai greatly\u2014", "4": "for when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of Adonai, Obadiah took 100 prophets, hid them 50 to a cave, and provided them with bread and water. ", "5": "Then Ahab said to Obadiah, \u201cGo through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis. Perhaps we may find grass and so keep the horses and mules alive and not lose all the animals.\u201d ", "6": "So they divided the land between them to explore it\u2014Ahab went one way by himself while Obadiah went another way by himself.", "7": "As Obadiah was on the road, all of a sudden, Elijah met him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, \u201cIs it you, my lord Elijah?\u201d", "8": "\u201cIt is I,\u201d he answered him. Go tell your lord, 'Look, Elijah is here!\u201d", "9": "\u201cHow have I sinned,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab, to put me to death? ", "10": "As Adonai your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you; and when they said, 'He is not here,' he made that kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you.", "11": "\u201cNow you're saying, 'Go tell your lord, \u201cLook, Elijah is here!\u201d' ", "12": "But as soon as I leave you, the Ruach Adonai may carry you off where I wouldn't know. Then, when I come and tell Ahab and he can't find you, he'll kill me! Now I, your servant, have feared Adonai since my youth. ", "13": "Wasn't my lord told what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of Adonai\u2014how I hid 100 of Adonai's prophets, 50 to a cave and provided them with bread and water? ", "14": "So now you say, 'Go tell your lord, \u201cLook, Elijah is here!'\u201d He'll kill me!\u201d", "15": "Then Elijah said, \u201cAs Adonai-Tzva'ot lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.\u201d", "16": "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; then, Ahab went to meet Elijah. ", "17": "Now when Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, \u201cIs it you, the one who causes trouble for Israel?\u201d", "18": "But he answered, \u201cI have not troubled Israel. Rather, it is you and your father's house\u2014by forsaking the mitzvot of Adonai and going after the Baalim. ", "19": "Now then, send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, together with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table.\u201d", "20": "So Ahab sent word to all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. ", "21": "Then Elijah approached all the people and said, \u201cHow long will you waver between two opinions? If Adonai is God, follow Him; but if Baal is, follow him.\u201d But the people did not answer him, not even a word.", "22": "Then Elijah said to the people, \u201cI am the only prophet of Adonai left, but Baal's prophets are 450 men. ", "23": "Now let them give us two young bulls. Let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it into pieces, lay it on the wood, and put no fire underneath, while I prepare the other bull, lay it on the wood, and put no fire underneath. ", "24": "Then you will call on the name of your god, and then, I will call on the Name of Adonai. The God who answers with fire, He is God.\u201d All the people responded and said, \u201cIt's a good thing.\u201d", "25": "Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \u201cChoose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first\u2014since you are so many. Then call on the name of your god, but put no fire underneath.\u201d", "26": "So they took the bull that he gave them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, crying, \u201cO Baal, answer us!\u201d But there was no voice\u2014no one was answering. They also danced leaping around the altar that was made.", "27": "Now when it was about noon, Elijah mocked them and said, \u201cShout louder! After all, he is a god! Maybe he's deep in thought, or he's relieving himself, or he's off on a journey, or perhaps he's asleep and must wake up!\u201d ", "28": "So they shouted even louder and cut themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until the blood gushed over them. ", "29": "When midday was past, they kept prophesying ecstatically until the time of offering up the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice, no one answering, no one paying attention.", "30": "Then Elijah said to all the people, \u201cCome near to me.\u201d So all the people came closer to him. Then he repaired the damaged altar of Adonai. ", "31": "Elijah took twelve stones\u2014like the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Adonai had come saying, \u201cIsrael shall be your name\u201d\u2014", "32": "and with the stones he built an altar in the Name of Adonai. Then he made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed. ", "33": "Then he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood.", "34": "Then he said, \u201cFill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.\u201d Then he said, \u201cA second time!\u201d and they did it a second time. Then he said, \u201cA third time!\u201d and they did it a third time. ", "35": "So the water ran around the altar and he also filled the trench with water.", "36": "Now it was at the time of offering up the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said, \u201cAdonai, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel,[a] let it be known today that You are God in Israel, that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. ", "37": "Answer me, Adonai, answer me, so that these people may know that You, Adonai, are God, and that You have turned their heart back again.\u201d", "38": "Then the fire of Adonai fell and consumed the burnt offering\u2014and the wood, the stones and the dust\u2014and licked up the water that was in the trench. ", "39": "When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, \u201cAdonai, He is God! Adonai, He is God!\u201d", "40": "Then Elijah said to them, \u201cSeize the prophets of Baal! Let not a single one of them escape.\u201d So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon and slew them there.", "41": "Then Elijah said to Ahab, \u201cGo up, eat and drink, for there's the sound of rain.\u201d ", "42": "So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, crouched on the ground and put his face between his knees.", "43": "[b] 43\u00a0Then he said to his servant, \u201cGo up now, look toward the sea.\u201d So he went up, looked, and said, \u201cThere's nothing.\u201d Then he said, \u201cGo back\u201d\u2014seven times\u2014", "44": "and it was the seventh time that he said, \u201cLook! A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\u201d Then he said, \u201cGo up, say to Ahab, 'Harness your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\u201d", "45": "In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. Ahab mounted and rode, and headed to Jezreel. ", "46": "Now the hand of Adonai was on Elijah, so he girded up his loins and outran Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."}

", "2": "He cried out against the altar with the word of Adonai and said: \u201cO altar, altar, thus says Adonai, behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and upon you will he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones will be burned upon you.'\u201d ", "3": "The same day he gave a sign, saying, \u201cThis is the sign that Adonai has spoken, the altar is about to be split apart and the fat ashes on it will be poured out.\u201d", "4": "Now when the king heard the word of the man of God, which he proclaimed against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar saying: \u201cSeize him!\u201d But the hand which he stretched out against him withered\u2014he could not even draw it back to himself. ", "5": "The altar also was split apart and the fat ashes poured out from the altar, just as was the sign that the man of God gave with the word of Adonai.", "6": "So the king responded by saying to the man of God: \u201cPlease seek the face of Adonai your God, and pray for me, so my hand may be restored to me!\u201d So the man of God sought the face of Adonai and the king's hand was restored to him, becoming as it was before.", "7": "Then the king said to the man of God: \u201cCome home with me and have something to eat, and then, I will give you a reward.\u201d", "8": "But the man of God said to the king: \u201cEven if you give me half your house, I will not go with you nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place.

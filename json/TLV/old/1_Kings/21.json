I'll give you a better vineyard than it in exchange, or if it seems better to you, I'll give you its price in money.\u201d", "3": "But Naboth said to Ahab, \u201cAdonai forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.\u201d", "4": "So Ahab went into his house sullen and resentful because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him, when he said, \u201cI will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.\u201d He lay down on his bed, turned away his face and would eat no food.", "5": "Then his wife Jezebel came to him and asked him, \u201cWhy is your spirit so sullen that you are eating no food?\u201d", "6": "Then he told her, \u201cBecause I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him: 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if it pleases you, I'll give you another vineyard for it,' but he answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'\u201d", "7": "Then his wife Jezebel said to him, \u201cNow, do you really govern the kingdom of Israel?

", "2": "The people, however, were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no House built for the Name of Adonai until those days. ", "3": "Now Solomon loved Adonai, walking in the statutes of his father David, except he kept sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. ", "4": "So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Upon this very altar Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings.", "5": "At Gibeon Adonai appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said: \u201cAsk for what should I give you?\u201d[a]", "6": "Solomon said: \u201cYou have shown my father Your servant David great lovingkindness, as he walked before You in truth, righteousness and uprightness of heart toward You. Indeed, You have kept this great lovingkindness for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.

I have given you a wise and discerning mind, so that there has been none like you before you, nor shall anyone like you arise after you.

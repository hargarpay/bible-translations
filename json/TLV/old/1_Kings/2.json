", "7": "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table\u2014for they befriended me when I fled from your brother Absalom. ", "8": "Also behold, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by Adonai saying: 'I will not put you to death with the sword.' ", "9": "Now don't let him go unpunished. For you are a wise man, and you will know how to deal with him, and bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood.\u201d", "10": "Then David slept with his fathers[b] and was buried in the city of David.

", "14": "Then he said, \u201cI have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cSpeak!\u201d she said.", "15": "Then he said, \u201cYou know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel looked to me to be the king. However, the kingship has turned about and become my brother's\u2014for it was his from Adonai. ", "16": "So now one petition I ask of you; do not deny me.\u201d \u201cSpeak!\u201d she said to him.", "17": "Then he said, \u201cPlease, speak to King Solomon\u2014for he won't turn you down\u2014to give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.\u201d", "18": "\u201cVery well,\u201d said Bath-sheba, \u201cI will speak to the king for you.\u201d", "19": "So Bath-sheba went to King Solomon to speak to him about Adonijah. The king rose up to greet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set up for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.

Ask for him the kingdom as well\u2014for he is my older brother\u2014for him and for Abiathar the kohen, and for Joab son of Zeruiah!\u201d ", "23": "Then King Solomon swore by Adonai saying: \u201cMay God do so to me and even more, if Adonijah does not pay with his own life for this request! ", "24": "Now therefore, as Adonai lives who has established me and set me on the throne of my father David, and who has made me a house as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.\u201d", "25": "Then King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada. He struck him down and he died.", "26": "Also to Abiathar the kohen the king said, \u201cGo to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you deserve death, but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of Adonai Elohim before my father David, and because you were afflicted in everything with which my father was afflicted.\u201d ", "27": "So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being kohen to Adonai\u2014so fulfilling the word of Adonai that He spoke at Shiloh about the house of Eli.", "28": "When the news came to Joab, he fled to the Tent of Adonai and grasped the horns of the altar\u2014for Joab had defected to Adonijah, though he had not defected to Absalom.

Then bury him. So you will remove the blood that Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.

He said to him: \u201cDidn't I make you swear by Adonai and forewarned you, saying: 'Know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere else, you shall surely die'? You even said to me: 'The saying is good; I have heard it.' ", "43": "Why then haven't you kept the oath of Adonai and the commandment that I charged you with?\u201d ", "44": "The king added to Shimei: \u201cYou know all the evil, which your heart should acknowledge, that you did to my father David. Therefore Adonai will return your evil on your own head.

Thus the kingdom was secured in the hand of Solomon."}

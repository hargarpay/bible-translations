", "2": "So fire came out from the presence of Adonai and consumed them. So they died before Adonai. ", "3": "Then Moses said to Aaron, \u201cThis is what Adonai spoke of, saying: To those who are near Me I will show myself holy. Upon the faces of all the people I will be glorified.\u201d Then Aaron kept silent.", "4": "Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, \u201cCome near, carry your relatives away from the front of the Sanctuary to outside of the camp.\u201d ", "5": "So they drew near and carried them, still in their tunics, outside of the camp, as Moses had said.", "6": "Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons: \u201cDo not uncover your heads or tear your clothes, so you may not die and He will not be angry with the entire congregation. But let your kinsmen\u2014the whole house of Israel\u2014mourn over the burning that Adonai has kindled. ", "7": "You must not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of Adonai is on you.\u201d So they acted according to the word of Moses.", "8": "Adonai spoke to Aaron saying: ", "9": "\u201cDo not drink wine or fermented drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, so that you do not die. This is to be a statute forever throughout your generations. ", "10": "You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean. ", "11": "And you are to teach Bnei-Yisrael all the statutes which Adonai has spoken to them through Moses.\u201d", "12": "Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Itamar his surviving sons: \u201cTake the grain offering left over from Adonai's offerings by fire, and eat it without hametz beside the altar, for it is most holy.

You certainly should have eaten it in the Sanctuary, as I commanded.\u201d", "19": "But Aaron said to Moses, \u201cBehold, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Adonai. When things like these have happened to me, would it have been good in the eyes of Adonai if I had eaten the sin offering today?\u201d ", "20": "When Moses heard this, it was good in his eyes."}

", "3": "When he came across the sheepfolds along the way where there was a cave, Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were already sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. ", "4": "So David's men said to him, \u201cLook, it's the day Adonai spoke to you about, 'Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, so you may do to him as seems good in your eyes.'\u201d Then David crept and cut off the corner of Saul's robe stealthily.", "5": "But afterward, David's conscience bothered him for cutting off the edge of Saul's robe. ", "6": "So he said to his fellow men, \u201cAdonai forbid that I should do such a thing to my lord, Adonai's anointed, stretching out my hand against him\u2014for he is Adonai's anointed.\u201d ", "7": "So David persuaded his fellow men with these words and did not let them rise against Saul.

", "9": "Then David said to Saul, \u201cWhy do you listen to men's words saying: 'Look, David intends you harm'? ", "10": "Look, today your own eyes should see how Adonai delivered you today into my hand, in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but my eye had pity on you, and I said: 'I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is Adonai's anointed.' ", "11": "Moreover, my father, see! Yes, look at the corner of your robe in my hand! For in cutting off the corner of your robe, yet not killing you, you should know and realize that there is no evil or rebellion in my hand. I haven't sinned against you, even though you are lying in wait for my life, to take it.

", "20": "Now behold, I know for certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will rise in your hand.

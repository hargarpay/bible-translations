For I have transgressed against the word of Adonai and your words\u2014because I feared the people and listened to their voice.", "25": "[b] 25\u00a0So now, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship Adonai.\u201d", "26": "But Samuel said to Saul, \u201cI will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Adonai, and Adonai has rejected you as king over Israel.\u201d", "27": "As Samuel turned about to go, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore.

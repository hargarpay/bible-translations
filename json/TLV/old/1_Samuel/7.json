{"1": "Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came and fetched up the ark of Adonai, brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of Adonai. ", "2": "From the day the ark rested in Kiriath-jearim it was a long time, 20 years, and the whole house of Israel yearned after Adonai. ", "3": "Then Samuel spoke to the whole house of Israel saying, \u201cIf you are returning to Adonai with all your heart, then remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, direct your hearts to Adonai and serve Him only. Then He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.\u201d ", "4": "So Bnei-Yisrael removed the Baalim[a] and the Ashtaroth, and served Adonai alone.", "5": "Then Samuel said, \u201cGather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to Adonai for you.\u201d ", "6": "So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water and poured it out before Adonai. They fasted on that day and said there, \u201cWe have sinned against Adonai.\u201d Then Samuel was judging Bnei-Yisrael at Mizpah.", "7": "Now when the Philistines heard that Bnei-Yisrael had assembled at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines marched against Israel. When Bnei-Yisrael heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. ", "8": "So Bnei-Yisrael said to Samuel, \u201cDon't stop crying out to Adonai our God for us, so He may save us from the hand of the Philistines!\u201d", "9": "Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to Adonai. Then Samuel cried out to Adonai for Israel and Adonai answered him. ", "10": "As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But Adonai thundered with loud thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them so that they were defeated before Israel. ", "11": "Then the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down all the way to below Beth-car.", "12": "Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named Eben-ezer[b] saying, \u201cThus far Adonai has helped us.\u201d ", "13": "So the Philistines were subdued and they did not invade the border of Israel anymore. The hand of Adonai was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. ", "14": "The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel, from Ekron to Gath, were restored to Israel, and Israel recovered its territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.", "15": "Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. ", "16": "He used to go annually on a circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, and would judge over Israel in all those places. ", "17": "Then his return was to Ramah, because his home was there, and from there he would judge Israel. So he built an altar to Adonai there."}

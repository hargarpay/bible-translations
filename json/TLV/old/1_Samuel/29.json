", "2": "As the Philistine lords were proceeding ahead of their hundreds and thousands, David and his men were bringing up the rear with Achish. ", "3": "Then the Philistine commanders said, \u201cWhat are these Hebrews doing here?\u201d Achish said to the Philistine commanders, \u201cNo! That's David, servant of Israel's King Saul\u2014he's been with me today for over a year, and I've not found any fault in him since the day he defected to me until now.\u201d", "4": "But the Philistine commanders got angry with him, and the Philistine commanders said to him, \u201cMake this man go back\u2014back to his place you assigned him. He must not go down with us to the battle, or in the battle he might become our adversary. For how would this fellow appease his lord? Wouldn't it be with the heads of our men?

Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, 'He must not go up with us to the battle.' ", "10": "So now, rise up early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord that came with you, and as soon you rise, early in the morning, once there is light, leave.\u201d ", "11": "So David rose up early, he and his men, leaving in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines.

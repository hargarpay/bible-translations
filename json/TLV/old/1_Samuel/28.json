{"1": "At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, \u201cYou surely know that you and your men must march out with me in the army.\u201d", "2": "David said to Achish, \u201cWell then, you know what your servant will do.\u201d \u201cWell then, I appoint you my bodyguard for life,\u201d Achish said to David.", "3": "Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, his hometown. Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists.", "4": "So the Philistines mustered and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped at Gilboa. ", "5": "Now when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. ", "6": "When Saul inquired of Adonai, Adonai did not answer, neither by dreams nor by Urim or prophets.", "7": "Then Saul said to his courtiers, \u201cFind me a woman who is a medium, so I may go to her and inquire through her.\u201d So his courtiers said to him, \u201cBehold, there is a woman that is a medium at En-dor.\u201d ", "8": "So Saul disguised himself, put on other clothes, and went with two other men, and they reached the woman by night. Then he said, \u201cPlease conjure up for me a ghost\u2014bring up for me the one I will name to you.\u201d", "9": "\u201cLook, you know what Saul has done,\u201d she said, \u201chow he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. So why then are you setting a trap for my life to get me killed?\u201d", "10": "Saul vowed to her by Adonai saying, \u201cAs Adonai lives, no punishment will come on you for this thing.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWhom will I bring up for you?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cBring me up Samuel,\u201d he said.", "12": "But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud shriek. Then the woman spoke to Saul saying, \u201cWhy have you deceived me? You are Saul!\u201d", "13": "\u201cDon't be afraid!\u201d the king said to her. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d The woman said to Saul, \u201cI see a godlike being coming up from the earth.\u201d", "14": "\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAn old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe,\u201d she said. Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, so he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. ", "15": "Samuel said to Saul, \u201cWhy have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\u201d \u201cI'm in great distress,\u201d Saul answered. \u201cThe Philistines are waging war against me, and God has turned away from me\u2014He doesn't answer me anymore, whether by prophets or by dreams. So I called you up to tell me what I should do.\u201d", "16": "Samuel said, \u201cSo why ask me, since Adonai has turned away from you and become your adversary? ", "17": "Now Adonai has done for Himself just as He foretold through me\u2014Adonai has torn the kingship out of your hand and has given it to another fellow, to David. ", "18": "Since you did not obey the voice of Adonai and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, so Adonai has done this to you today. ", "19": "Moreover, Adonai will also give the Israelites who are with you into the hand of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me! Yes, Adonai will give the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.\u201d", "20": "Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground, and became so terrified because of the words of Samuel that there was absolutely no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night. ", "21": "Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was so agitated, so she told him, \u201cBehold, your maidservant obeyed you; I put my life in my hand by listening to your words, which you spoke to me. ", "22": "Please you too listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you, so you can eat and have strength to go on your way.\u201d", "23": "But he refused and said, \u201cI won't eat.\u201d But when his courtiers and the woman urged him, he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. ", "24": "The woman had a fatted calf in the house, so she hurried and butchered it, and took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it. ", "25": "She brought it before Saul and his courtiers, and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night."}

", "3": "So they loaded the ark of God on a new cart and carried it out of the house of Abinadab that was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, drove the new cart ", "4": "as they brought it from the house of Abinadab (which was on the hill) with the ark of God, and Ahio was walking in front of the ark.", "5": "Meanwhile David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating before Adonai with all kinds of instruments made of cypress wood, with harps, lyres, tambourines, three-stringed instruments and cymbals[b]. ", "6": "But when they reached the threshing floor of Nahon, Uzzah reached out to the ark of God and grasped it, for the oxen had stumbled.

", "8": "David was upset because of Adonai's outburst against Uzzah. That place is called Perez-uzzah[c] to this day.", "9": "So David was frightened of Adonai that day. Then he said, \u201cHow can the ark of Adonai come to me?\u201d ", "10": "David was unwilling to move the ark of Adonai to him, to the City of David; instead, David diverted it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

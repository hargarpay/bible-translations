{"1": "Now the anger of Adonai again flared up against Israel, so He incited David against them saying, \u201cGo, number Israel and Judah.\u201d ", "2": "The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, \u201cGo about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, so that I may know the sum of the people.\u201d", "3": "But Joab said to the king, \u201cMay Adonai your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king looks on! But why does my lord the king desire such a thing?\u201d", "4": "Nevertheless, the king's command to Joab and the army generals remained firm. So Joab and the army generals went out from the king's presence to number the people of Israel. ", "5": "They crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and toward Jazer. ", "6": "Then they went to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. Then they came to Dan-jaan and round about to Sidon, ", "7": "and came to the stronghold of Tyre, to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. ", "8": "So when they had gone throughout all the land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days. ", "9": "Joab reported the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: there were in Israel 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword and the men of Judah were 500,000 men.", "10": "But David's heart troubled him after he had numbered the people. So David prayed to Adonai, \u201cI have sinned greatly in what I have done! But now, Adonai, please take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.\u201d", "11": "When David rose up in the morning, the word of Adonai came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying: ", "12": "\u201cGo and speak to David, thus says Adonai: 'Three things I am proposing to you\u2014choose one of them and I will bring it upon you.'\u201d ", "13": "So Gad came to David and told him, saying to him, \u201cShall seven years of famine come on you in your land? Or will you flee from your adversary for three months while he is pursuing you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should return to Him who sent me.\u201d", "14": "Then David said to Gad, \u201cI am in a great distress. Let us now fall into the hand of Adonai, for His mercies are great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.\u201d ", "15": "So Adonai sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, so that 70,000 men of the people died from Dan to Beersheba. ", "16": "When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Adonai relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, \u201cEnough! Now withdraw your hand.\u201d The angel of Adonai was then by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.", "17": "When David saw the angel that was striking down the people, he spoke to Adonai saying, \u201cBehold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have done wrong! But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let Your hand be against me and against my father's house.\u201d", "18": "On that day Gad came to David and said to him, \u201cGo up, set up an altar to Adonai on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\u201d ", "19": "So David went up according to the word of Gad, as Adonai had commanded. ", "20": "Now when Araunah looked down and saw the king and his courtiers crossing over toward him, Araunah went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. ", "21": "Then Araunah said, \u201cWhy has my lord the king come to his servant?\u201d David said, \u201cTo buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to Adonai, so that the plague may be held back from the people.\u201d", "22": "Then Araunah said to David, \u201cLet my lord the king take and offer up what seems good in his eyes. Look here, the oxen for the burnt offering, as well as the threshing sledges and the ox yokes for the wood. ", "23": "All this Araunah gives to the king.\u201d Araunah said further to the king, \u201cMay Adonai your God accept you.\u201d", "24": "But the king said to Araunah, \u201cNo, but I will surely buy it from you at a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to Adonai my God that cost me nothing.\u201d So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 shekels of silver. ", "25": "Then David built there an altar to Adonai, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. So Adonai was moved by prayer of entreaty for the land, and restrained the plague from Israel."}

Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give out its water.[a] You will bring out water from the rock, and you will give the community something to drink, along with their livestock.\u201d", "9": "So Moses took the staff from before the presence of Adonai, just as He had commanded him.", "10": "Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock.

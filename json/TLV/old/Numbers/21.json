They put them and their cities under the ban of destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah.", "4": "They travelled from Mount Hor along the route to the Sea of Reeds in order to go around the land of Edom. The spirit of the people became impatient along the way.", "5": "The people spoke against God and Moses: \u201cWhy have you brought us from Egypt to die in the wilderness, because there is no bread, no water, and our very spirits detest the despicable food? ", "6": "So Adonai sent poisonous serpents among the people,[a] and they bit the people and many of the people of Israel died.", "7": "The people came to Moses and said, \u201cWe sinned when we spoke against Adonai and you! Pray to Adonai for us, that He may take away the snakes!\u201d So Moses prayed for the people.", "8": "Adonai said to Moses, \u201cMake yourself a fiery snake and put it on a pole.

This is the well where Adonai said to Moses, \u201cGather the people and I will give them water.\u201d", "17": "Then Israel sang this song, \u201cSpring up, O well! Sing about it!\u201d", "18": "The well the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank with their scepter and their staffs.\u201d From the wilderness they went on to Mattanah.

We will not turn aside into field or vineyard nor drink water from the wells. We will travel on the king's highway until we will have passed through your territory.\u201d", "23": "But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon called out his entire army and marched out into the desert to oppose Israel. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.

He has given up his sons as refugees and his daughters as captives to Sihon, king of the Amorites.", "30": "But we overthrew them! Heshbon as far as Dibon is destroyed! We have demolished them as far as Nophah up to Medeba.\u201d", "31": "So Israel was living in the land of the Amorites.

Og, king of the Bashan, went out to confront them, he and all his people, in battle at Edrei.", "34": "Adonai said to Moses, \u201cDo not fear him. I have given him with all his people and his land into your hand.

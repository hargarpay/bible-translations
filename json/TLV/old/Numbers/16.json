", "3": "They assembled against Moses and Aaron. They said to them, \u201cYou've gone too far! All the community is holy\u2014all of them\u2014and Adonai is with them! Then why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of Adonai?\u201d", "4": "When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.", "5": "Then he said to Korah and all his following saying, \u201cIn the morning Adonai will reveal who is His and who is holy. The one whom He will let come near to Him will be the one He chooses to come near to Him. ", "6": "Do this, Korah and your whole following! Take for yourselves censers.

You sons of Levi are the ones who have gone too far!\u201d", "8": "Moses also said to Korah, \u201cListen now, sons of Levi! ", "9": "Isn't it enough that the God of Israel has set you apart from the community of Israel to bring you near to Him to do the work of the Tabernacle of Adonai and to stand before the community to minister to them? ", "10": "So He brought you close, along with all your fellow sons of Levi. But you are seeking the priesthood, too!

", "14": "What's more, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you now gouge out the eyes of those men? We won't come!\u201d", "15": "Then Moses became very angry and said to Adonai, \u201cDo not accept their offering. I haven't taken from them a single donkey, nor have I wronged one of them!\u201d", "16": "So Moses said to Korah, \u201cYou and your whole following are to appear before Adonai\u2014you, they and Aaron\u2014tomorrow!

Dathan and Abiram came outside and were standing at the entrance of their tents with their wives, their children, and their little ones.", "28": "Moses said, \u201cBy this you will know that Adonai has sent me to do all these works, that they are not from my own heart.

The earth closed over them and they were gone from among the community.", "34": "All Israel around them fled at their outcry, for they shouted, \u201cPerhaps the earth will swallow us!\u201d", "35": "Fire also came out from Adonai and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.", "36": "Adonai spoke to Moses saying, ", "37": "\u201cTell Eleazar son of Aaron the kohen, to take the censers from the burning, because they are holy, and scatter the coals at a distance.

For they were presented before Adonai, so they are holy. They are to be a sign to Bnei-Yisrael.\u201d", "39": "So Eleazar the kohen collected the bronze censers brought by the ones who were burned and hammered them into an overlay for the altar, ", "40": "just as Adonai had spoken to him by Moses' hand, so that it would be as a reminder to Bnei-Yisrael that no one who was not a descendant of Aaron should burn incense before Adonai, and so no one would become like Korah and his following.", "41": "The next day, the entire community of Bnei-Yisrael grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, \u201cYou killed Adonai's people!\u201d", "42": "But when they gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, behold, the cloud covered it and the glory appeared!

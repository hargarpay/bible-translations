", "3": "Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, not turning away from them.", "4": "Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep-breeder, and he used to render as tribute to the king of Israel the wool of 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams.

Will you march with me against Moab to battle?\u201d Jehoshaphat replied, \u201cI will march. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.\u201d ", "8": "And he added, \u201cBy which route will we go up?\u201d He answered, \u201cThe route of the wilderness of Edom.\u201d", "9": "So the king of Israel, the king of Judah and the king of Edom marched.

", "7": "Then he tore down the quarters of the male cult prostitutes that had been in the House of Adonai, where the women had been weaving coverings for the Asherah.", "8": "Then he brought all the priests from the towns of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He also broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the city governor, which were on one's left as one entered the city gate. ", "9": "Nevertheless, the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of Adonai in Jerusalem, but they did eat matzot with their kinsmen.", "10": "Next he defiled Topheth, which is in the Ben-hinnom Valley, so that no one might make his son or daughter pass through the fire for Molech.

He did to them just as he had done in Bethel. ", "20": "All the priests of the high places there he slaughtered on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.", "21": "Then the king commanded all the people saying, \u201cCelebrate the Passover to Adonai your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.\u201d ", "22": "For no Passover like this had been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel or in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.

", "30": "So his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him and made him king in his father's place.

He also imposed on the land a fine of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold.", "34": "Then Pharaoh Necoh installed Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought him to Egypt, and he died there. ", "35": "Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money in keeping with Pharaoh's command. He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, each according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh.

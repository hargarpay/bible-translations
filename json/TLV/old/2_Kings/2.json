", "2": "Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here please, for Adonai has sent me on to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs Adonai lives, and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d So they went down to Bethel.", "3": "Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, \u201cDo you know that Adonai is going to take your master away from over you today?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I know. Be silent.\u201d", "4": "Then Elijah said to him, \u201cElisha, stay here please, for Adonai has sent me on to Jericho.\u201d But he said, \u201cAs Adonai lives and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d So they came to Jericho.", "5": "Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, \u201cDo you know that Adonai is going to take away your master from over you today?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes, I know. Be silent.\u201d", "6": "Then Elijah said to him, \u201cStay here please, for Adonai has sent me to the Jordan.\u201d But he said, \u201cAs Adonai lives and as you live, I will not leave you.\u201d So both of them went on.", "7": "Then 50 of the sons of the prophets went and stood aside at a distance from them, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.

Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so to you; but if not, it will not be so.\u201d", "11": "As they were walking along and talking, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. ", "12": "As Elisha was watching, he was crying out, \u201cAvi! Avi! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!\u201d Then he saw him no more.

When he returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan, ", "14": "he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen off him, struck the waters and said, \u201cWhere is Adonai, the God of Elijah?\u201d As he indeed struck the waters, they parted here then there. Then Elisha crossed over.", "15": "When the sons of the prophets at Jericho saw him some way off, they said, \u201cThe spirit of Elijah has rested on Elisha.\u201d So they came to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. ", "16": "Then they said to him, \u201cBehold now, there are 50 strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Ruach Adonai has taken him up and cast him onto some mountain or into some valley.\u201d But he said, \u201cDon't send them.\u201d ", "17": "But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, \u201cSend them.\u201d So they sent 50 men.

No longer will there be from there death or barrenness.\u201d ", "22": "So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.", "23": "From there he went up to Bethel. As he was going up along the road, some young boys came out of the city. They mocked him saying to him, \u201cGo on up, baldy! Go on up, baldy!\u201d ", "24": "So he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the Name of Adonai. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and mauled 42 of the boys.", "25": "From there he went to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."}

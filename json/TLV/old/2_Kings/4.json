{"1": "Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha saying, \u201cYour servant my husband is dead\u2014you know that your servant feared Adonai. Now the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves.\u201d", "2": "\u201cWhat should I do for you?\u201d Elisha asked her. \u201cTell me, what do you have in the house?\u201d She replied, \u201cYour handmaid has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.\u201d", "3": "Then he said, \u201cGo borrow for yourself vessels from all your neighbors\u2014empty jars\u2014not just a few. ", "4": "Then go inside and shut the door behind you and behind your sons, and pour into all those vessels, setting aside what is full.\u201d", "5": "So she left him and shut the door behind her and behind her sons. They kept bringing the vessels to her and she kept pouring. ", "6": "When the vessels were full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another vessel.\u201d But he said to her, \u201cThere isn't another vessel.\u201d So the oil stopped.", "7": "Then she came and told the man of God. So he said, \u201cGo sell the oil and pay your debt, then you and your sons can live on the rest.\u201d", "8": "One day when Elisha passed through Shunem, where there was a prominent woman who persuaded him to eat some food. And so it was, whenever he passed through, he would stop for a meal. ", "9": "Then she said to her husband, \u201cBehold now, I realize that this man who often passes through is a holy man of God. ", "10": "Please, let's make a little walled room on the roof, and let's put there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lampstand for him. Then whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "One day he came there, and retired to the upper chamber and lay down there. ", "12": "Then he said to Gehazi his servant, \u201cCall this Shunammite woman.\u201d When he had called her, she stood before him. ", "13": "He said to him, \u201cTell her: Behold, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can be done for you? Can something be communicated to the king or to the commander of the army for you?\u201d She answered, \u201cI am living among my own people.\u201d", "14": "So he asked, \u201cThen what should be done for her?\u201d Then Gehazi answered, \u201cIn fact, she has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "\u201cCall her,\u201d he said. And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway. ", "16": "Then he said, \u201cAt this season next year, you will be embracing a son.\u201d But she said, \u201cNo, my lord, do not lie to your handmaid, man of God.\u201d", "17": "Nevertheless, the woman conceived and bore a son during that season the following year, just as Elisha had told her.", "18": "Now when the child was grown, one day he went out to his father among the reapers. ", "19": "Then he said to his father, \u201cMy head, my head!\u201d So he said to his servant, \u201cCarry him to his mother.\u201d ", "20": "So he picked him up and brought him to his mother. The child sat on her lap until noon, and then died. ", "21": "She then went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door on him and went out. ", "22": "Then she called to her husband, and said, \u201cPlease send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys that I may run to the man of God and come back.\u201d", "23": "But he said, \u201cWhy are you going to him today? It is neither New Moon nor Shabbat.\u201d But she said, \u201cIt will be well.\u201d", "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \u201cMove on! Don't slow down riding unless I tell you.\u201d", "25": "So she set out and came near the man of God at Mount Carmel. Upon seeing her from a distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook! There's the Shunammite. ", "26": "Please, run now to meet her and ask her: 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the boy?'\u201d She answered, \u201cIt is well.\u201d ", "27": "But when she arrived at the mountain, up to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. Then Gehazi stepped forward to push her away, but the man of God said, \u201cLeave her alone, for her soul is bitter within her, yet Adonai has hid it from me and has not told me.\u201d", "28": "\u201cDid I ask my lord for a son?\u201d she said. \u201cDidn't I say, 'Don't deceive me'?\u201d", "29": "Then he said to Gehazi, \u201cGird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, don't greet him. Or if anyone greets you, don't answer him; and lay my staff on the face of the child.\u201d", "30": "But the mother of the child said, \u201cAs Adonai lives and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So he arose and followed her. ", "31": "Gehazi passed on ahead of them and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and told him, saying, \u201cThe boy has not awakened.\u201d", "32": "When Elisha entered the house, there was the child, dead and laying on his bed. ", "33": "So he entered and shut the door behind the two of them and prayed to Adonai. ", "34": "Then he got up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched himself upon him. So the flesh of the child became warm. ", "35": "Then he stepped down and walked in the house to and fro, and then he got up on the bed and stretched himself on him. The child sneezed seven times, then the child opened his eyes. ", "36": "He then called Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite.\u201d So he called her. When she came in to him, he said, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came, fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.", "38": "Afterward Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, \u201cPut on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.\u201d", "39": "Then one of them went out into the field to gather herbs, found a wild vine and picked from it a lapful of wild gourds. Then he came back and sliced them into the stew pot, for they didn't know what they were. ", "40": "Then they served it for the men to eat. But it came to pass as they were still eating the stew, they cried out and said, \u201cO man of God, there is death in the pot.\u201d So they could not eat it.", "41": "But he said, \u201cBring some flour,\u201d and he threw it into the pot and said, \u201cServe it to the people and let them eat.\u201d So there was nothing bad in the pot.", "42": "Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits\u201420 loaves of barley bread and fresh ears of corn in his sack. Then he said, \u201cGive them to the people that they may eat.\u201d", "43": "But his attendant said, \u201cWhat? Will I set this before a hundred men?\u201d But he said, \u201cGive them to the people that they may eat, for thus says Adonai, 'They will eat and will have left over.'\u201d ", "44": "So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of Adonai."}

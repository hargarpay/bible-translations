", "3": "The waters kept receding gradually from upon the land and the waters decreased by the end of 150 days. ", "4": "The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. ", "5": "The waters went on decreasing until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.", "6": "It was at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made. ", "7": "Then he sent out a raven and it kept going back and forth until the waters were drying up from the land. ", "8": "Then he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground. ", "9": "But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot. She returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole land. He stretched out his hand and he took her, and brought her to him into the ark. ", "10": "So he waited yet another seven days and again he sent the dove out from the ark. ", "11": "The dove came to him at evening, and surprisingly\u2014a freshly plucked olive leaf was in its mouth. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the land. ", "12": "After he waited seven more days, he sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again.", "13": "It was in his six-hundred-and first year\u2014in the first month, on the first day of the month\u2014that the waters had dried up from the land.

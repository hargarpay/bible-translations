", "2": "But he gave his voice to weeping so that the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh's household heard. ", "3": "Joseph said to his brothers, \u201cI am Joseph! Is my father still alive?\u201d And his brothers were unable to answer him because they were terrified at his presence.", "4": "Then Joseph said to his brothers, \u201cPlease come near me.\u201d So they came near. \u201cI'm Joseph, your brother\u2014the one you sold to Egypt,\u201d he said. ", "5": "\u201cSo now, don't be grieved and don't be angry in your own eyes that you sold me here\u2014since it was for preserving life that God sent me here before you.

", "7": "But God sent me ahead of you to ensure a remnant in the land and to keep you alive for a great escape. ", "8": "So now, it wasn't you, you didn't send me here, but God! And He made me as a father to Pharaoh, lord over his whole house and ruler over the entire land of Egypt.", "9": "\u201cGo up quickly to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son, Joseph: God has made me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me. Don't delay.

", "13": "You must tell my father about all my honor in Egypt, and about all that you've seen. And you must quickly bring my father down here.\u201d", "14": "Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept while Benjamin wept upon his neck, ", "15": "and he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. Finally after this, his brothers talked with him.", "16": "When the commotion was heard in Pharaoh's house\u2014\u201cJoseph's brothers have come!\u201d\u2014it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, ", "17": "So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cSay to your brothers: 'Do this! Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan. ", "18": "Then get your father, your households, and come to me. I'll give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.'

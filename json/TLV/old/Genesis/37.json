When Joseph was 17 years old (he was a youth), he was shepherding the flocks with his brothers\u2014with the sons of his father's wives Bilhah and Zilpah. Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.", "3": "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age. So he had made him a long-sleeved tunic. ", "4": "When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak to him in shalom.", "5": "Then Joseph dreamed a dream and told his brothers\u2014and they hated him even more. ", "6": "He said to them, \u201cPlease listen to this dream I dreamed. ", "7": "There we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field. All of a sudden, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.\u201d", "8": "\u201cWill you truly be a king over us?\u201d his brothers said to him. \u201cWill you really rule over us?\u201d So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of his words.", "9": "But then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, \u201cI have just dreamed another dream. Suddenly, there was the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowing down to me!\u201d ", "10": "He told it to his father as well as his brothers. Then his father rebuked him and said to him, \u201cWhat's this dream you dreamed? Will we really come\u2014your mother and I with your brothers\u2014to bow down to the ground to you?\u201d ", "11": "So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the speech in mind.", "12": "Then his brothers went to graze their father's flocks at Shechem.

For I heard them saying, 'Let's go to Dothan.'\u201d So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.", "18": "Now they saw him from a distance. Before he was close to them they plotted together against him in order to kill him. ", "19": "They said to one another, \u201cHere comes the master of dreams! ", "20": "Come on now! Let's kill him and throw him into one of those pits, so we can say that an evil animal devoured him.

When they looked up, behold, there was a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balsam, and myrrh\u2014going to bring them down to Egypt.", "26": "Then Judah said to his brothers, \u201cWhat profit is there if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come on! ", "27": "Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let's not lay our hand on him\u2014since he's our brother, our own flesh.\u201d His brothers listened to him.

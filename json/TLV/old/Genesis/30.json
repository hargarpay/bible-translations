{"1": "When Rachel saw that she bore no children for Jacob, Rachel was jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, \u201cGive me sons\u2014if there are none, I'll die!\u201d", "2": "But Jacob became furious with Rachel and said, \u201cAm I, instead of God, the one who withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\u201d", "3": "So she said, \u201cHere's my maid-servant Bilhah. Go to her and let her give birth on my knees, so that from her I may also build a family.\u201d ", "4": "Then she gave her maid-servant Bilhah to him for a wife, and Jacob went to her. ", "5": "Bilhah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob. ", "6": "So Rachel said, \u201cGod has judged my cause and also heard my voice\u2014and given me a son.\u201d Therefore she named him Dan. ", "7": "Then Rachel's female servant became pregnant again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob. ", "8": "So Rachel said, \u201cI've surely wrestled greatly with my sister\u2014also I've won.\u201d So she named him Naphtali.", "9": "Now Leah saw that she stopped having children, so she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife. ", "10": "Then Zilpah, Leah's female servant, gave birth to a son for Jacob. ", "11": "Leah said, \u201cHow fortunate!\u201d So she named him Gad. ", "12": "Then Zilpah, Leah's female servant, gave birth to a second son for Jacob. ", "13": "Leah said, \u201cHow happy am I, for daughters have called me happy.\u201d So she named him Asher.", "14": "Now during the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and he brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, \u201cPlease give me some of your son's mandrakes.\u201d[a]", "15": "But she said to her, \u201cWasn't it enough that you took my husband away? You'd also take away my son's mandrakes?\u201d So Rachel said, \u201cThat being so, let him lie with you tonight, in exchange for your son's mandrakes.\u201d", "16": "So when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and she said, \u201cYou must come to me. For I've actually hired you with my son's mandrakes.\u201d So he lay with her that very night. ", "17": "Moreover, God heard Leah, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. ", "18": "Leah said, \u201cGod gave me my reward[b] because I gave my female servant to my husband.\u201d So she named him Issachar.

So she said, \u201cGod has taken away my disgrace.\u201d ", "24": "She named him Joseph saying, \u201cMay Adonai add another son for me.\u201d", "25": "Now it was after Rachel gave birth to Joseph that Jacob said to Laban, \u201cSend me away so that I can go to my place and to my land. ", "26": "Give me my wives and my children for whom I've served you, and let me go. For you yourself know my labor\u2014that I've served you.\u201d", "27": "But Laban said to him, \u201cIf I've found favor in your eyes\u2014I've looked for good omens, and Adonai has blessed me because of you.\u201d ", "28": "Moreover he said, \u201cName your own price and I'll pay it.\u201d", "29": "Then he said to him, \u201cYou yourself know how I've served you and how your livestock fared with me. ", "30": "For you had very little before I came, and it has been busting at the seams in abundance. So Adonai blessed you with my every step. So now, when am I myself going to make something for my household also?\u201d", "31": "Then he said, \u201cWhat can I pay you?\u201d Jacob said, \u201cYou don't need to pay me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will shepherd your flock again and watch it: ", "32": "let me pass through your flock today, removing every colorfully spotted lamb from there and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep as well as the colorfully spotted among the goats\u2014and that will be my salary. ", "33": "So tomorrow my honesty will testify on my behalf when you come to check on my salary you agreed to. Every one that isn't colorfully spotted among the goats or dark-colored among the sheep with me, it is stolen.\u201d", "34": "So Laban said, \u201cAll right! May it be according to your word.\u201d ", "35": "On that day he removed the colorfully striped and colorful billy goats as well as all the colorfully spotted goats\u2014everyone with white on it\u2014and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and he put them in the hand of his sons. ", "36": "Then he put a three-day's journey between them and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding Laban's remaining flocks.", "37": "But Jacob took fresh white poplar, almond, and plane tree branches, peeled away white stripped sections on them, exposing the white of the branches. ", "38": "Then he set the branches he had peeled in front of the flocks in the drinking troughs and watering channels where the flocks come to drink. Since they were in heat when they came to drink, ", "39": "the flocks mated near the branches, and the flocks gave birth to striped, spotted and colorful ones. ", "40": "Now Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped ones as well as all the dark-colored ones among Laban's flocks. Then he set aside the herds for himself and did not put them with Laban's flocks. ", "41": "Whenever the strong flocks mated, Jacob put the branches in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flocks, to have them mate near the branches. ", "42": "But when the flocks were sickly, he did not put the branches down\u2014so the sickly ones became Laban's and the stronger ones became Jacob's. ", "43": "And the man grew exceedingly prosperous and had numerous flocks, along with female and male servants, camels and donkeys."}

", "4": "But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and distributed to the four winds of heaven\u2014though it will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the authority he exercised, for his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others besides these.", "5": "\u201cThen the king of the south will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he, and he will rule a greater kingdom than his.

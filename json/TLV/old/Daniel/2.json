", "2": "So the king issued an order to summon the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers and Chaldeans in order to explain to the king his dreams. When they came and stood before the king, ", "3": "he said to them, \u201cI have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.\u201d", "4": "Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic[a], \u201cMay the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.\u201d", "5": "The king answered the Chaldeans saying, \u201cI firmly decree: If you do not make the dream and its meaning known to me, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses reduced to rubble. ", "6": "But if you tell the dream and its meaning, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and its meaning!\u201d", "7": "They responded a second time, saying, \u201cLet the king tell his servants the dream and we will declare the interpretation.\u201d", "8": "The king replied saying, \u201cI know for sure that you are buying time since you see that I have firmly decreed ", "9": "that if you do not reveal the dream to me, there is only one verdict[b] for you. You have conspired to say something false and fraudulent, until such a time as things might change. So then, tell me the dream and I will know that you can tell me its meaning.\u201d", "10": "The Chaldeans answered the king saying, \u201cThere is no man on earth who can meet the king's demand. For no great king, however great or mighty, has ever asked such a thing from any magician, astrologer or Chaldean. ", "11": "What the king asks is too difficult. There is no one who could declare it to the king, except the gods whose dwelling is not with mortals!\u201d", "12": "Because of this, the king became furiously angry and gave orders to execute all the wise men of Babylon. ", "13": "So the decree went out that the wise men were about to be slaughtered. They also sought Daniel and his companions to execute them. ", "14": "Then Daniel spoke with tact and discretion to Arioch, who was captain of the king's guard and who had set out to execute the wise men of Babylon. ", "15": "He spoke up and said to Arioch, the king's captain, \u201cWhy is the king's decree so urgent?\u201d Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter.", "16": "So Daniel went in and asked the king to grant him time, so that he might disclose the interpretation to the king.

Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven ", "20": "and answered, saying: \u201cBlessed be the Name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.", "21": "He changes times and seasons. He removes kings and installs kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.", "22": "He reveals deep and hidden things. He knows what lies in darkness and light dwells with Him.", "23": "To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise! For You gave me wisdom and power.

The Revealer of mysteries has made known to you what is going to happen.

", "34": "While you were watching, a stone was cut out, but not by hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. ", "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from summer threshing-floors that the wind blows away. Not a trace of them could be found. Then the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.", "36": "\u201cThis was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation. ", "37": "You, O king, are the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, might and glory. ", "38": "Wherever mankind, beasts of the field, and fowls of the heaven dwell, He has given them into your hand, and made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.", "39": "\u201cNow after you another kingdom will arise, one inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over all the earth. ", "40": "Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron\u2014for iron shatters and breaks everything\u2014and just as iron smashes everything, so will it shatter and crush all the others. ", "41": "Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly potter's clay and partly iron, so this will be a divided kingdom. It will have some of the strength of the iron, for you saw the iron mixed with clay. ", "42": "As the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. ", "43": "Just as you saw iron mixed with clay, people will mix with one another, but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.", "44": "\u201cNow in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will this kingdom be left to another people. It will crush and bring to an end all of these kingdoms. But it will endure forever.", "45": "[c] 45\u00a0For just as you saw a stone cut out of a mountain, yet not by hands, crush the iron, bronze, clay, silver and gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen in the future. Now the dream is certain, and its interpretation is trustworthy.\u201d", "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel and gave orders that an offering and incense be provided for him. ", "47": "In response the king said to Daniel, \u201cSurely your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings,[d] and the revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this secret!\u201d", "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel and lavished on him many marvelous gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief over all the wise men of Babylon.

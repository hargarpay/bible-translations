You will be called by a new name, which Adonai's mouth will bestow.", "3": "You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Adonai, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.", "4": "No longer will you be termed \u201cForsaken\u201d, no longer your land termed \u201cDesolate\u201d. Instead you will be called, \u201cMy Delight is in Her\u201d and your land, \u201cMarried\u201d. For Adonai delights in you, and your land will be married.", "5": "For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you.

All day and all night, they will never hold their peace. \u201cYou who remind Adonai, take no rest for yourselves,", "7": "And give Him no rest until He establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.", "8": "Adonai has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm: \u201cSurely I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies, nor will foreigners drink your new wine, for which you have labored.", "9": "But those who have garnered it will eat it and praise Adonai, and those who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of My Sanctuary.\u201d", "10": "Go through, go through the gates. Clear the way for the people! Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Lift up a banner over the peoples.", "11": "Behold, Adonai has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the Daughter of Zion, \u201cBehold, your salvation comes! See, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.\u201d[a]", "12": "Then they will call them The Holy People, The Redeemed of Adonai, and you will be called, Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken."}

{"1": "Draw near, O nations, to hear, and listen, O peoples! Let the earth hear, and all it contains, the world, and all its offspring!", "2": "For Adonai is enraged at all the nations, and furious at all their armies. He will utterly destroy them. He will give them over to slaughter.", "3": "So their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise, and the hills will be drenched with their blood.", "4": "Then all the host of heaven will dissolve, and the skies will be rolled up like a scroll\u2014 so all their array will wither away, like a leaf drooping from a vine, like a fig shriveling from a fig tree.", "5": "For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens. See, it will come down upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to judgment.", "6": "The sword of Adonai is filled with blood, gorged with fat\u2014 the blood of lambs and goats, the fat of kidneys of rams. For Adonai has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.", "7": "Wild oxen will go down with them, bull calves with mighty steers. So their land will be soaked with blood and their dust greasy with fat.", "8": "For Adonai has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the hostility against Zion.", "9": "Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into brimstone, and its land will become burning tar.", "10": "It will not be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will lay waste\u2014 forever and ever none will pass through it.", "11": "But pelican and porcupine will have it, owl and raven will dwell in it. He will stretch a line of chaos over it and stones of desolation.", "12": "As for its nobles, there are none there to call it a kingdom, and all its princes will come to nothing.", "13": "Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It will be a haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches.", "14": "Wildcats will meet with wolves, the goat-demon will cry to its kind\u2014 yes, the night monster will settle there and find itself a resting place.", "15": "A tree snake will nest and lay eggs there, hatch and gather them under its shadow. Surely, hawks are gathered there, each one with her mate.", "16": "Seek from the scroll of Adonai, and read! Not one of them will be missing; none will lack its mate. For His mouth commanded it, and His Ruach gathered them.", "17": "He cast the lot for them, and His hand divided it out to them with the line. They will possess it forever, and dwell in it from generation to generation."}

Go up, Elam! Besiege, Media! I have put an end to all her groaning.\u201d", "3": "Therefore my body is filled with pain. Pangs have taken hold of me like the pangs of a woman in labor. I am bewildered by what I hear, terrified by what I see.", "4": "My heart is bewildered, terror overwhelms me. The twilight I longed for has been turned into trembling.", "5": "Set the table, spread out the cloth! Eat! Drink! \u201cRise up, you princes, oil the shield!\u201d", "6": "For Adonai has said to me. \u201cGo, post a watchman\u2014 let him declare what he sees!", "7": "When he sees a chariot with a pair of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him pay attention\u2014 very close attention!\u201d", "8": "Then he cried out like a lion: \u201cUpon the watch tower, Adonai, I stand continually in the daytime, and stay at my post every night.", "9": "Look!

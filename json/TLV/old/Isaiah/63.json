This One splendid in His apparel, pressing forward in His great might?\u201d \u201cIt is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.\u201d", "2": "\u201cWhy is Your apparel so red, and Your garments like one who treads in a wine press?\u201d[a]", "3": "\u201cI have trodden the winepress alone\u2014 from the peoples, no man was with Me. I trod them in My anger, and trampled them in My wrath. Their lifeblood spattered My garments, so I stained all My robes.", "4": "For a day of vengeance was in My heart, and My year of redemption has come.", "5": "I looked, but there was no one to help. I was amazed, but no one was assisting. So My own arm won victory for Me, and My wrath upheld Me.", "6": "So I trod down the peoples in My anger, and made them drunk in My wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood[b] on the earth.\u201d", "7": "I will remember the lovingkindnesses of Adonai, the praises of Adonai, according to all that Adonai has granted us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which He has granted them according to His compassion, and according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses.", "8": "For He said, \u201cSurely they are My people, children who will not deal falsely.\u201d So He became their Savior.", "9": "In all their affliction He was afflicted. So the angel of His presence saved them. In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them, then He lifted them and carried them all the days of old.", "10": "But they rebelled, and grieved His Ruach ha-Kodesh. So He turned to become their enemy.

Where is He who put among them His Ruach ha-Kodesh?", "12": "Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? Who divided the waters before them\u2014 to make Himself a Name forever?", "13": "Who led them through the depths? Like a horse in the desert, they did not stumble.", "14": "Like cattle that go down into a valley, the Ruach Adonai gave them rest. So You led Your people, to make Yourself a glorious Name.", "15": "Look down from heaven and see from Your holy, glorious, lofty abode. Where are Your zeal and mighty deeds? Are the yearnings of Your heart, Your compassions, withheld from me?", "16": "For You are our Father\u2014 even if Abraham would not know us or Israel not recognize us. You, Adonai, are our Father, our Redeemer\u2014 from everlasting is Your Name.", "17": "Adonai, why do You cause us to stray from Your ways, and harden our heart from fearing You? Return for Your servants' sake, the tribes of Your heritage.", "18": "Briefly Your holy people possessed it\u2014 our foes have trampled Your Sanctuary.", "19": "We have become like those over whom[c] You have never ruled, like those not called by Your Name. Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at Your presence!"}

Then He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths.\u201d For Torah will go forth from Zion[a] and the word of Adonai from Jerusalem.", "4": "He will judge between the nations and decide for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more.", "5": "Come house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of Adonai.", "6": "For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob. For they are filled with soothsayers from the east, and they have clapped hands with the children of foreigners.", "7": "Their land also is full of silver and gold, nor is there any limit to their treasures. Their land also is full of horses, nor is there any limit to their chariots.", "8": "Their land also is full of idols.

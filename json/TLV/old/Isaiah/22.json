Your dead were not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.", "3": "All your rulers have fled together, then captured without a bow. All who were caught were taken into exile together, though they had fled far off.", "4": "Therefore I said, \u201cLook away from me! Let me weep bitterly\u2014 don't try to comfort me about the ruin of the daughter of my people.\u201d", "5": "For my Lord Adonai-Tzva'ot has a day of panic, trampling and confusion\u2014 in the Valley of Vision\u2014 of tearing down a wall, a catastrophe on the mountain.", "6": "Elam took up the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.", "7": "So it will come to pass that your choicest valleys will be full of chariots and horsemen posted at the gate.

", "9": "Then you will see the breaches in the walls of the city of David\u2014for they will be many\u2014though you collect the water of the lower pool. ", "10": "Though you counted the houses of Jerusalem, you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. ", "11": "You even made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool\u2014but you did not look to the Maker, or consider the One who planned it long before.", "12": "Now in that day, Adonai Elohei-Tzva'ot will call for weeping and wailing, for baldness and putting on sackcloth.", "13": "But instead, there is joy and gladness, slaughtering cattle and killing sheep, meat and drinking wine! \u201cLet's eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!\u201d", "14": "But Adonai-Tzva'ot revealed in my ears: \u201cSurely this sin will not be atoned for until you die,\u201d says my Lord Adonai-Tzva'ot.", "15": "Thus says my Lord Adonai-Tzva'ot: \u201cGo, say to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the house: ", "16": "'What are you doing here, and who are you to be here, that you cut out a grave for yourself, carving out a tomb on the height, chiseling a crypt for yourself in the rock?

A sound of uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathered! Adonai-Tzva'ot is mustering the army for battle.", "5": "They are coming from a far country\u2014 from the end of the heavens\u2014 Adonai and the weapons of His wrath, to destroy the whole land.", "6": "Wail, for the day of Adonai is near! it will come as destruction from Shaddai.", "7": "Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man's heart will melt.", "8": "They will be terrified; pain and anguish will take hold of them; they will writhe as a woman in labor; they will look aghast at one another\u2014 their faces aflame!", "9": "Behold, the day of Adonai comes, cruel, full of wrath and fierce fury, to make the earth a desolation, and destroy its sinners from it.", "10": "For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light.

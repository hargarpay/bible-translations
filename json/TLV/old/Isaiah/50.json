{"1": "Thus says Adonai: \u201cWhere is the divorce certificate, by which I sent your mother away? Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you? See, you were sold for your iniquities, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.", "2": "Why was no one there when I came? Why was there no one to answer when I called? Is My hand too short to redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, I dry up the sea at My rebuke, I make rivers a wilderness\u2014 their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.", "3": "I clothe the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their covering.\u201d", "4": "Adonai Elohim has given Me the tongue of the learned,[a] that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning. He awakens My ear to give heed as a disciple.", "5": "Adonai Elohim has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn back.", "6": "I gave My back to those who strike, and My cheeks to those pulling out My beard; I did not hide My face from humiliation and spitting.[b]", "7": "For Adonai Elohim will help Me. Therefore I have not been disgraced. Therefore I set My face like flint, and I know that I will not be ashamed.", "8": "The One who vindicates Me is near. Who will accuse Me? Let us stand up to each other. Who is My adversary? Let him confront Me.", "9": "See, Adonai Elohim will help Me. Who is he who would condemn Me? See, they all wear out like a garment. A moth will eat them up.", "10": "Who among you fears Adonai? Who hears the voice of His servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the Name of Adonai and lean on his God.", "11": "\u201cBehold, all you who kindle a fire, encircling yourselves with firebrands. Walk in the light of your fire and among the brands you have lit. This you will have from My hand: you will lie down in torment.\u201d"}

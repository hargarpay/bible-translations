{"1": "The burden of Tyre. Wail, ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed. There is no house and no harbor. From the land of Cyprus, it was revealed to them.", "2": "Be still, inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, your messengers crossing the sea.", "3": "On many waters the grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile was her revenue and a marketplace of nations.", "4": "Be ashamed, O Sidon. For the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, \u201cI have not writhed or given birth. I have not reared young men or brought up maidens.\u201d", "5": "When the report reaches Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report about Tyre.", "6": "Cross over to Tarshish. Wail, you inhabitants of the island!", "7": "Is this your jubilant city? Whose antiquity is from long ago, whose feet have taken her to settle in far off lands?", "8": "Who planned this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of earth?", "9": "Adonai-Tzva'ot has planned it, to defile the pride of all glory, to shame all the honored of earth.", "10": "Overflow through your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish! There is no restraint any more.", "11": "His hand has stretched out over the sea, He has shaken the kingdoms. Adonai has given a commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy its strongholds.", "12": "He said, \u201cYou will exult no more.\u201d O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Cyprus\u2014 even there you will have no rest.", "13": "Look, the land of the Chaldeans\u2014 this is the people who no longer exist. Assyria set it up for desert animals. They set up their siege towers; they stripped its palaces; they made it a ruin.", "14": "Wail, you ships of Tarshish! For your stronghold is destroyed.", "15": "Then it will come about in that day that Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, like the days of one king. At the end of 70 years it will happen to Tyre just as in the song of the prostitute:", "16": "\u201cTake a harp, stroll about the city, forgotten harlot! Skillfully play many songs, so you may be remembered.\u201d", "17": "Then it will come about after the end of 70 years that Adonai will take note of Tyre. She will return to her trade and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. ", "18": "Yet her profit and her wages will be set apart to Adonai. They will not be stored up or hoarded. For her profit will be for those who dwell in the presence of Adonai, as ample food and as fine clothing."}

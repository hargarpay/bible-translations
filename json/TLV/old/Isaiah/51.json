For when I called him, he was but one, then I blessed him and multiplied him.\u201d", "3": "For Adonai will comfort Zion. He will comfort all her waste places. He will make her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of Adonai. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and a sound of melody.", "4": "\u201cPay attention to Me, My people, give ear to Me, My nation. For Torah will go out from Me, My justice as a light to the peoples.[a]", "5": "My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone out, and My arms will judge the nations. The coastlands will wait for Me\u2014 for My arm they will wait expectantly.", "6": "Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath.

Everlasting joy will be upon their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.", "12": "\u201cI, I am the One who comforts you. Who are you that you should fear man, who dies, or a son of man, who is given up like grass?\u201d", "13": "But you forgot Adonai your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. Are you in constant dread all day because of the fury of the oppressor as he makes ready to destroy? But where is the fury of the oppressor?", "14": "Soon one bowed down will be released.

Or instruct Him as His counselor?", "14": "With whom did He consult, and who instructed Him? Who taught Him in the path of justice or taught Him knowledge? Who informed Him about the way of understanding?", "15": "Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and count as a speck of dust on the scales. Behold, the islands weigh as fine dust.", "16": "Lebanon is not enough to burn, or its animals enough for a burnt offering.", "17": "All the nations are as nothing before Him. By Him they are accounted null and void.", "18": "To whom then will you liken God? To what likeness will you compare Him?", "19": "To an idol? A craftsman casts it, a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.", "20": "One too poor for such an offering chooses wood that will not rot.

{"1": "Oy, Ariel[a], Ariel! City where David camped. Year to year again\u2014festivals in a cycle.", "2": "But I will distress Ariel. There will be lamenting and moaning\u2014 then will she be like Ariel to Me?", "3": "I will encamp against you all around, I will set up siege-works against you and will raise up ramps against you.", "4": "You will be brought low, you will speak from the ground. From the dust where you are prostrate your speech will come. Your voice will be like a ghost out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.", "5": "Yet the multitude of your foes will become like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrifying like chaff that passes away. It will happen in an instant, suddenly.", "6": "You will be visited by Adonai-Tzva'ot with thunder, earthquake, huge noise, whirlwind and storm-wind, and the flame of a consuming fire.", "7": "It will be like a dream, a night vision: the multitude of all the nations warring against Ariel, yes, all warring against her, the ramparts around her and her besiegers.", "8": "It will be like a hungry man dreaming and behold, he is eating, but awakes with his hunger unsatisfied, or like a thirsty man dreaming and behold, he is drinking, but awakes faint, his soul thirsting. So it will be with the multitude of all the nations warring against Mount Zion.", "9": "Wait, and be astounded! Blind yourselves, and be blind! Drunk, but not with wine, Stagger, but not with strong drink.", "10": "For Adonai has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has shut your eyes\u2014the prophets, and covered your heads\u2014the seers.", "11": "So this entire vision is for you like the words of a sealed scroll, which they give to one who knows books, saying, \u201cRead this, please,\u201d but he says, \u201cI can't, because it's sealed.\u201d ", "12": "Then the scroll is given to one who does not know books, saying, \u201cRead this, please,\u201d but he says, \u201cI don't know books.\u201d", "13": "So Adonai says, \u201cSince these people draw near with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, yet their hearts are far from Me, and their fear of Me is a mitzvah taught by men.[b]", "14": "Therefore, behold, once more I will do a marvelous work among this people\u2014 a marvel and a wonder\u2014 so the wisdom of their wise will perish, and the discernment of their discerning will be concealed.\u201d", "15": "Oy, those who go to great depths to hide their plans from Adonai! Their works are in the dark. They say, \u201cWho sees us? Who knows us?\u201d", "16": "Your perversity! Should the potter be regarded the same as the clay? Should the thing made say to its maker, \u201cYou did not make me\u201d? Or the thing formed say of its former, \u201cYou have no understanding?\u201d[c]", "17": "Will it not be just a very little while before Lebanon turns into a garden, and a garden will seem like a forest?", "18": "In that day the deaf will hear words of a book, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.", "19": "The meek will add to their joy in Adonai, and the needy of humanity will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.", "20": "For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished, and all watching to do evil cut off.", "21": "Those who make a man out to be guilty with a word, and trap him who reproves at the gate, and deny justice with meaninglessness.", "22": "Therefore, thus says Adonai, Redeemer of Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: \u201cJacob will no longer be ashamed, no longer will his face grow pale;", "23": "for when he sees his children, the work of My hands in his midst, they will sanctify My Name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and stand in awe of the God of Israel.", "24": "Those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will learn instruction.\u201d"}

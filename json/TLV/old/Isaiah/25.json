{"1": "Adonai, You are my God, I will exalt You, I will praise Your Name, for You have done wonderful things, plans of old with steadfast faithfulness.", "2": "For You have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a foreigner's palace a city no more\u2014 never to be rebuilt.", "3": "Therefore a strong people will honor You. Cities of ruthless nations will fear You.", "4": "For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the rainstorm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against the wall.", "5": "Like heat in a dry place, You subdue the roar of foreigners. Like heat in the shade of a cloud, the song of tyrants is brought low.", "6": "On this mountain, Adonai-Tzva'ot will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples\u2014 a banquet of aged wine\u2014 of rich food, of choice marrow, of aged wine well refined.", "7": "On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the veil spread over all nations.", "8": "He will swallow up death forever.[a] my Lord Adonai will wipe away tears from every face.[b] He will remove His people's reproach from all the earth. For Adonai has spoken.", "9": "It will be said in that day: \u201cBehold, this is our God, We waited for Him\u2014He will save us. This is Adonai\u2014we waited for Him. We will rejoice and be glad in His salvation.\u201d", "10": "For the hand of Adonai will rest on this mountain. Moab will be trampled under Him, as straw is trampled in a manure pile.", "11": "When he spreads his hands in it as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim, his pride will be brought down low together with the trickery of his hands.", "12": "He will level your high-fortified walls, lay them low, and cast them down to the ground, down to dust."}

{"1": "Happy is the one who has not walked in the advice of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scoffers.", "2": "But his delight is in the Torah of Adonai, and on His Torah he meditates day and night.", "3": "He will be like a planted tree over streams of water, producing its fruit during its season. Its leaf never droops\u2014 but in all he does, he succeeds.", "4": "The wicked are not so. For they are like chaff that the wind blows away.", "5": "Therefore the wicked will not stand during the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.", "6": "For Adonai knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to ruin."}

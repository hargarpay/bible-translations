{"1": "For the music director, a psalm of David. In Adonai I have taken shelter. How can you say to my soul: \u201cFly like a bird to your mountain?", "2": "For look, the wicked bend the bow. They fix their arrow on the bowstring so they can shoot from the shadows at those who are upright in heart.", "3": "If our foundations are destroyed, what should the righteous do?\u201d", "4": "Adonai is in His holy Temple. Adonai's throne is in heaven.[a] His eyes are watching. His eyelids observe the children of men.", "5": "Adonai examines the righteous. But the wicked and one loving violence His soul hates.", "6": "On the wicked He will rain down fire, brimstone and scorching wind as the portion of their cup!", "7": "For Adonai is righteous\u2014He loves justice. The upright will see His face."}

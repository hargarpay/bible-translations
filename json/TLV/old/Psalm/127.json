{"1": "A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon. Unless Adonai builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless Adonai watches over the city, the watchman stands guard in vain.", "2": "In vain you rise up early and stay up late, eating the bread of toil\u2014 for He provides for His beloved ones even in their sleep.", "3": "Behold, children are a heritage of Adonai \u2014the fruit of the womb is a reward.", "4": "As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one's youth.", "5": "Happy is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies at the gate."}

{"1": "For the music director, a psalm of David.", "2": "How long, Adonai? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?", "3": "How long must I have cares in my soul and daily sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me?", "4": "Look at me and answer, Adonai my God. Light up my eyes, or I will sleep in death.", "5": "Or else my enemy will say: \u201cI have overcome him!\u201d and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.", "6": "But I trust in Your lovingkindness, my heart rejoices in Your salvation. I will sing to Adonai, because He has been good to me."}

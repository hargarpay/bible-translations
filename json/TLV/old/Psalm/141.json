May the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.", "3": "Set a guard, Adonai, over my mouth. Keep watch over the door of my lips.", "4": "Let not my heart turn to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity, nor let me eat of their delicacies.", "5": "Let the righteous strike me\u2014it is kindness. Let him correct me\u2014it is oil on my head \u2014my head will not refuse it. Yet still my prayer is against their wickedness.", "6": "Their judges are thrown down from a cliff. Then they will hear my words, since they are sweet.", "7": "As when one plows and breaks open the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.", "8": "For my eyes are toward You, God my Lord. In You I have taken refuge\u2014do not expose my soul.", "9": "Keep me from the jaws of the trap they have laid for me, and from the snares of the evildoers.", "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely."}

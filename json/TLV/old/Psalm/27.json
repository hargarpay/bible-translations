{"1": "Of David. Adonai is my light and my salvation: whom should I fear? Adonai is the stronghold of my life: whom should I dread?", "2": "When evildoers approached me to devour my flesh \u2014my adversaries and my foes\u2014they stumbled and fell.", "3": "Though an army camp besieges me, my heart will not fear. Though war breaks out against me, even then will I be confident.", "4": "One thing have I asked of Adonai, that will I seek: to dwell in the House of Adonai all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Adonai, and to meditate in His Temple.", "5": "For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His sukkah, conceal me in the shelter of His tent, and set me high upon a rock.", "6": "Then will my head be high above my enemies around me. In His Tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy. I will sing, yes, sing praises to Adonai.", "7": "Hear, Adonai, when I call with my voice, be gracious to me and answer me.", "8": "To You my heart says: \u201cSeek My face.\u201d Your face, Adonai, I seek.", "9": "Do not hide Your face from me. Do not turn Your servant away in anger. You have been my help. Do not abandon me or forsake me, O God my salvation.", "10": "Though my father and my mother forsake me, Adonai will take me in.", "11": "Teach me Your way, Adonai, and lead me on a level path\u2014 because of my enemies.", "12": "Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes. For false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.", "13": "Surely I trust that I will see the goodness of Adonai in the land of the living.", "14": "Wait for Adonai. Be strong, let Your heart take courage, and wait for Adonai."}

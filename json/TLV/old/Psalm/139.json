{"1": "For the music director: a psalm of David. Adonai, You searched me and know me.", "2": "Whenever I sit down or stand up, You know it. You discern my thinking from afar.", "3": "You observe my journeying and my resting and You are familiar with all my ways.", "4": "Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, Adonai, You know all about it.", "5": "You hemmed me in behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me.", "6": "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.", "7": "Where can I go from Your Ruach? Where can I flee from Your presence?", "8": "If I go up to heaven, You are there, and if I make my bed in Sheol, look, You are there too.", "9": "If I take the wings of the dawn and settle on the other side of the sea,", "10": "even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will lay hold of me.", "11": "If I say: \u201cSurely darkness covers me, night keeps light at a distance from me,\u201d", "12": "even darkness is not dark for You, and night is as bright as day\u2014 darkness and light are alike.", "13": "For You have created my conscience. You knit me together in my mother's womb.", "14": "I praise You, for I am awesomely, wonderfully made! Wonderful are Your works\u2014 and my soul knows that very well.", "15": "My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.", "16": "Your eyes saw me when I was unformed, and in Your book were written the days that were formed\u2014 when not one of them had come to be.", "17": "How precious are Your thoughts, O God! How great is the sum of them!", "18": "Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand! When I awake, I am still with You.", "19": "If only You would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloody men!", "20": "For they speak about You with wicked intent. Your enemies reproach You in vain.", "21": "Do I not hate those who hate You, Adonai? Do I not loathe those who rise against You?", "22": "I hate them with total hatred\u2014 I consider them my enemies.", "23": "Search me, O God, and know my heart. Examine me, and know my anxious thoughts,", "24": "and see if there be any offensive way within me, and lead me in the way everlasting."}

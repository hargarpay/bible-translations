{"1": "A psalm of David. Adonai, who may dwell in Your tent? Who may live on Your holy mountain?", "2": "The one who walks with integrity, who does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart,", "3": "who does not slander with his tongue, does not wrong his neighbor, and does not disgrace his friend,", "4": "who despises a vile person in his eyes, but honors those who fear Adonai, who keeps his oath even when it hurts, and does not change,", "5": "who lends his money without usury, and takes no bribe against the innocent. One who does these things will never be shaken."}

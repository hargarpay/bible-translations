Those who trust in Adonai are like Mount Zion\u2014 it cannot be moved, but endures forever.", "2": "As the mountains are around Jerusalem, so Adonai is all around His people, both now and forever.", "3": "For a scepter of wickedness will not rest over the land of the righteous\u2014 lest the righteous set their hands to evil.", "4": "Do good, Adonai, to the good, and to those upright in their hearts.", "5": "But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Adonai will lead them away with evildoers. Shalom be upon Israel."}

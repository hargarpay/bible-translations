{"1": "A Psalm of Asaph. God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, defiled Your holy Temple, and reduced Jerusalem to ruins.", "2": "They gave the carcasses of Your servants as food to the birds of the skies, the flesh of Your kedoshim to the beasts of the earth.", "3": "They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.", "4": "We have become a taunt to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us.", "5": "How long, Adonai, will You be angry? Forever? Will Your jealousy keep blazing like fire?", "6": "Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name.", "7": "For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his country.", "8": "Do not hold against us the sins of our fathers. May Your mercies come quickly to meet us, for we are brought very low.", "9": "Help us, God of our salvation\u2014 for the sake of the glory of Your Name. Deliver us, and atone for our sins\u2014 for Your name's sake.", "10": "Why should the nations say: \u201cWhere is their God?\u201d Before our eyes, let it be known among the nations that You avenge the shed blood of Your servants.", "11": "Let the prisoner's groan come to You. By Your great arm preserve those who are doomed to die.", "12": "Pay back into the midst of our neighbors sevenfold their reproach\u2014 the reproach they hurled at You, my Lord.", "13": "So we, Your people, the flock of Your pasture, will praise You forever. From generation to generation we will recount Your praise."}

{"1": "A psalm of David. Adonai is my shepherd, I shall not want.", "2": "He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.", "3": "He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for His Name's sake.", "4": "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me: Your rod and Your staff comfort me.", "5": "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You have anointed my head with oil, my cup overflows.", "6": "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of Adonai forever."}

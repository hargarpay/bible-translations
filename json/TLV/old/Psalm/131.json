{"1": "A Song of Ascents. Of David. Adonai, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes lofty, nor do I go after things too great or too difficult for me.", "2": "But I have calmed and quieted my soul\u2014 like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.", "3": "O Israel, put your hope in Adonai from this time forth and forever."}

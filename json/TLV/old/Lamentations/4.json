The daughter of my people has become cruel, like ostriches in the desert.", "4": "The nursing infant's tongue clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst. Little children ask for bread, but no one gives it t0 them.", "5": "Those who used to eat delicacies are desolate in the streets. Those who were brought up in purple embrace trash heaps.", "6": "For the iniquities of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment,[a] yet no hands turned to her.", "7": "Purer than snow were her princes,[b] whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphire.", "8": "Their form has become darker than soot! They are not recognized in the street. Their skin has shriveled on their bones, withered like a tree.", "9": "Better are those slain by the sword than those struck down by famine\u2014 they waste away, racked with pain, for lack of fruits of the field.", "10": "The hands of compassionate women boiled their own children.

{"1": "Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah saying, \u201cNone of us will give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage.\u201d ", "2": "So the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. ", "3": "They said, \u201cAdonai God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that one tribe should be missing in Israel?\u201d", "4": "Then it was on the next day that the people rose up early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. ", "5": "Then Bnei-Yisrael asked, \u201cWho is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the assembly before Adonai?\u201d For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to Adonai at Mizpah saying, \u201cHe will surely be put to death.\u201d", "6": "Now Bnei-Yisrael felt sorry for Benjamin their brother and said, \u201cToday one tribe has been cut off from Israel. ", "7": "What should we do about providing wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by Adonai not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?\u201d", "8": "Then they inquired, \u201cWhich one of the tribes of Israel that did not go up to Adonai at Mizpah?\u201d Then behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. ", "9": "For when the people were numbered, behold not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. ", "10": "So the congregation sent 12,000 valiant warriors there, and commanded them saying, \u201cGo and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. ", "11": "Now this is the thing that you will do: you are to utterly destroy every male and every woman who has lain with a man.\u201d ", "12": "So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known man by lying with him. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.", "13": "Then the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed shalom to them. ", "14": "When Benjamin returned at that time, they gave them the women whom they had spared from the women of Jabesh-gilead. Yet they were not enough for them. ", "15": "So the people were sorry for Benjamin because Adonai had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. ", "16": "Then the elders of the congregation said, \u201cWhat should we do about wives for those who are left, since the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?\u201d ", "17": "They said \u201cThe survivors of Benjamin must have heirs, so that a tribe would not be blotted out from Israel.

Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.", "24": "So Bnei-Yisrael departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and family. Everyone went out from there to his own inheritance.", "25": "In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes."}

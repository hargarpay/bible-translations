{"1": "Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose up early and camped beside En-harod, while the camp of Midian was north of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley.", "2": "But Adonai said to Gideon, \u201cToo many are the people who are with you, for Me to give the Midianites into their hand. Otherwise Israel would glorify itself against Me saying, 'My own hand has delivered me.'", "3": "[a] 3\u00a0So now, make proclamation in the ears of the people saying, 'Whoever is afraid or anxious may turn back and leave from Mount Gilead.'\u201d So 22,000 people turned back, while ten thousand remained.", "4": "But Adonai said to Gideon, \u201cThe people are still too many. Bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Now it will be that he of whom I say to you, 'This will go with you,' he will go with you, but anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one will not go with you,' he will not go.\u201d ", "5": "So he brought the troops down to the water, and Adonai said to Gideon, \u201cYou are to set apart everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, and everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.\u201d ", "6": "Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. ", "7": "Then Adonai said to Gideon, \u201cWith the 300 men who lapped I will deliver you and give the Midianites into your hand. So let all the other people go, every man to his place.\u201d ", "8": "So the 300 took provisions and their shofarot in their hands. He sent all the other men of Israel each to his tent, but he kept the 300 men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley. ", "9": "It came to pass the same night that Adonai said to him, \u201cArise, get down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. ", "10": "But if you are afraid to go down, first go down to the camp with your attendant Purah. ", "11": "Then you will hear what they are saying, and after that your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.\u201d So he went down with his attendant Purah to an outpost of the army that was in camp.", "12": "Now the Midianites, the Amalekites and all the people of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were countless, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. ", "13": "Yet when Gideon came, behold, there was a man relating a dream to his fellow, saying, \u201cListen, I just now had a dream: there was a loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into the camp of Midian, came up to a tent and struck it so it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.\u201d", "14": "His companion answered and said, \u201cThis is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel\u2014God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand!\u201d", "15": "Now when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, \u201cArise! For Adonai has given into your hand the camp of Midian.\u201d ", "16": "Then he divided the 300 men into three columns, and he put into the hands of all of them shofarot and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers. ", "17": "Then he said to them, \u201cWatch me and do likewise. So behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do just as I do. ", "18": "When I and all that are with me blow the shofar, then you also blow the shofarot all around the camp, and say, 'For Adonai and for Gideon!'\u201d", "19": "So Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came up to the outermost part of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch. Then they blew the shofarot and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands. ", "20": "When the three columns blew the shofarot and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the shofarot in their right hands to blow, and they shouted, \u201cA sword for Adonai and for Gideon!\u201d ", "21": "Each one stood in his place around the camp, and then the entire army ran, shouting as they fled. ", "22": "Now when they blew the 300 shofarot, Adonai set every man's sword against his fellow throughout the entire army. So the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.", "23": "Then men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian. ", "24": "Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim saying, \u201cCome down against Midian and seize the waters down to Beth-barah, all along the Jordan.\u201d So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and took control of the waterside as far as Beth-barah by the Jordan. ", "25": "Then they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and they slew Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They kept pursuing Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan."}

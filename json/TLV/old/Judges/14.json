Now when he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it, though he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.", "10": "Then his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a banquet there, for so the young men used to do.

If you can indeed solve it for me during the seven days of the banquet, and figure it out, then I will give you 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes; ", "13": "but if you cannot solve it for me, then you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes.\u201d \u201cPropose your riddle,\u201d they said to him. \u201cLet's hear it!\u201d", "14": "So he said to them, \u201cOut of the eater came forth food, out of the strong came forth sweet.\u201d But for three days they could not solve the riddle.

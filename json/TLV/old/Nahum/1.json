{"1": "The oracle[a] concerning Nineveh\u2014the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.", "2": "A jealous and avenging God is Adonai. Yes, Adonai is the avenger and master of wrath. Adonai is avenger to His adversaries, Yes, a keeper of wrath for His foes.", "3": "Adonai is slow to anger and great in power, but He will by no means acquit the guilty. Adonai's way is with a whirlwind or with a storm wind, Clouds are the dust of His feet.", "4": "Rebuking the sea, He made it dry, as He has dried up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel languished, Yes, Lebanon's budding languished.", "5": "Mountains quaked because of Him, and the hills have melted. The earth has heaved up at His presence\u2014 yes, the world and everything dwelling in it.", "6": "Before His indignation who can stand? Who can withstand His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and cliffs break down before Him.", "7": "Adonai is good as a refuge in the day of distress, and He knows those who take refuge in Him.", "8": "But with an overwhelming flood, He will make that place a total ruin. Darkness will pursue His enemies.", "9": "What can you scheme against Adonai? He will make a complete destruction. Distress will not arise twice.", "10": "For even like tangled thorns they will be consumed, or like drunkards who are drunk, or like stubble that is fully dry.", "11": "Out of you has come a schemer of evil against Adonai, a counselor of Belial.[b]", "12": "Thus said Adonai: Though they are strong and numerous, even so they will be mowed down and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.", "13": "I will now break his yoke from you, and tear apart your bonds.", "14": "Adonai has issued a command against you: no more will your name be spread. From the house of your gods I will cut off the idol and metal image. I will prepare your grave\u2014 for you have become worthless."}

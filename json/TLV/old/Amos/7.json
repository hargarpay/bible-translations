", "2": "When the locust-swarm had finished devouring the vegetation of the land, I said: \u201cAdonai Elohim, please pardon! How can Jacob stand, for he is small?\u201d", "3": "Adonai relented concerning this. \u201cIt shall not be,\u201d Adonai said.", "4": "This is what my Lord Adonai has shown me: Behold, Adonai Elohim was calling for the trial by fire, and it would have devoured the great deep, and it would have devoured the territory. ", "5": "But I said: \u201cMy Lord Adonai, stop, please! How can Jacob stand, for he is small?\u201d", "6": "Adonai relented concerning this. \u201cThis also shall not happen,\u201d says my Lord Adonai.", "7": "This is what He has revealed to me: Behold, my Lord was standing by a vertical wall, and in His hand was a plumb line. ", "8": "Then Adonai said to me: \u201cWhat do you see, Amos?\u201d I said: \u201cA plumb line.\u201d Then my Lord said: \u201cBehold, I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel\u2014 I will no longer pass over them.", "9": "So the high places of Isaac will become desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste, and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.\u201d", "10": "Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent word to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying: \u201cAmos has been conspiring against you in the midst of the house of Israel.

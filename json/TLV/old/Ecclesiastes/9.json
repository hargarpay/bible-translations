{"1": "For all this I laid on my heart and to ascertain all this: that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works are in the hand of God. Whether love or hatred, no one knows\u2014everything awaits them.", "2": "Everyone shares the same destiny: for the righteous and the wicked; for the good, the ritually clean and the defiled; for one who sacrifices and one who does not sacrifice; as the good person so the sinner; as the one who swears like the one who fears an oath.", "3": "This is a misery in everything done under the sun: that the same destiny awaits everyone. Moreover, the hearts of all humans are full of evil, and folly is in their hearts during their lives\u2014after that they die. ", "4": "Everyone who is among the living has hope\u2014even a living dog is better off than a dead lion.", "5": "For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, even the memory of them is forgotten.", "6": "Their love, their hatred, and their zeal have already perished; never again will they have a share in anything that is done under the sun.", "7": "Go! Eat your bread with gladness and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already accepted your deeds. ", "8": "Let your clothes always be white, and do not spare oil on your head.

", "14": "There was a little city with a few people in it and a mighty king came against it, surrounded it, and built great siege works against it. ", "15": "Now a poor, wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his shrewdness. Yet nobody remembered that poor man! ", "16": "So I said: \u201cWisdom is better than strength.\u201d But the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heeded.", "17": "The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than a ruler's shout among fools.", "18": "Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good."}

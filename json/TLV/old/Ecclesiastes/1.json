{"1": "The words of Kohelet[a], son of David, king in Jerusalem.", "2": "Futile! Futile! says Kohelet. Completely meaningless! Everything is futile![b]", "3": "What does a person gain in all his labor that he toils under the sun?", "4": "A generation comes, and a generation goes, but the earth remains forever.", "5": "The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to the place it rises.", "6": "The wind goes toward the south, and circles around to the north. Round and round it swirls about, ever returning to its circuits.", "7": "All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they go again.", "8": "All things are wearisome. No one can express them. The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.", "9": "What has been is what will be, and what has been done will be done again. There is nothing new under the sun.", "10": "Is there anything about which is said, \u201cLook! This is new!\u201d?

What is missing cannot be counted.", "16": "I spoke with my heart saying: \u201cI have grown rich and increased in wisdom more than any who were before me over Jerusalem. Indeed, my heart has experienced much wisdom and knowledge.\u201d ", "17": "So I applied my heart to know wisdom as well as to know madness and folly. I learned that this too was pursuit of the wind.", "18": "For with much wisdom comes much grief, and whoever keeps increasing knowledge, increases heartache."}

", "2": "Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her.", "3": "When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, ", "4": "as well as the food on his table, the seating of his courtiers, the service and attire of his attendants, his cupbearers and their attire, and his procession with which he went up to the House of Adonai, it took her breath away.", "5": "She said to the king: \u201cThe report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and your wisdom is true. ", "6": "But I did not believe their reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. And behold, not even half of the greatness of your wisdom was described to me\u2014you surpass the report that I heard! ", "7": "How blessed are your men, how blessed are your courtiers who continually stand in your presence and hear your wisdom. ", "8": "Blessed be Adonai your God who delighted in you, setting you on His throne as king before Adonai your God. Because your God loved Israel, establishing them forever, He made you king over them to execute justice and righteousness.\u201d", "9": "Then she gave the king 120 gold talents, large quantities of spices and precious stones. There had never been such quantities of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. ", "10": "The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algumwood and precious stones. ", "11": "From the sandalwood the king made ramps for the House of Adonai and for the royal palace, and lyres and harps for the singers\u2014nothing like them had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.

", "18": "The throne had six steps and a golden footstool attached to it, and arms on each side of the seat. Two lions stood beside the arms ", "19": "and 12 lions stood on the six steps, one at each end of each step. None like it was ever made for any kingdom. ", "20": "All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the palace of the Lebanon Forest were of pure gold\u2014silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.

", "3": "For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had demolished, he reerected altars for the Baalim, made Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the host of heaven and worshipped them. ", "4": "He built altars in the House of Adonai\u2014of which Adonai had said, \u201cMy Name will be in Jerusalem forever.\u201d ", "5": "He also built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the House of Adonai. ", "6": "Furthermore, he made his children pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom and practiced witchcraft, divination and sorcery, and consulted ghosts and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of Adonai, provoking Him to anger.", "7": "Then he placed the carved image of the idol that he had made in the House of God\u2014of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, \u201cIn this House and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name forever.

", "10": "Adonai spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.", "11": "Therefore, Adonai brought against them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze shackles, and led him to Babylon.", "12": "In his distress, he entreated Adonai his God and greatly humbled himself before the God of his fathers.

Then Manasseh knew that Adonai, He is God.", "14": "Afterward he built an outer wall to the city of David west of Gihon in the valley, as far as the entrance to the Fish Gate, and encircling the Ophel; he also raised it up much higher. He stationed military officers in all the fortified cities of Judah.", "15": "He also removed the foreign gods and idols from the House of Adonai, as well as all the altars that he had built on the mount of the House of Adonai and in Jerusalem and threw them outside the city.

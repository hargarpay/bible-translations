{"1": "O, that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my mother's breasts. If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.", "2": "I would lead you and bring you into my mother's house\u2014 she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink from the nectar of my pomegranate.", "3": "O that his left hand were under my head, and his right hand embraced me.", "4": "I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, Do not arouse or awaken love until it so delights.", "5": "Who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you. There your mother travailed with you. There she who was in labor gave you birth.", "6": "Set me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, jealousy as cruel as Sheol. Its flames are bolts of fire, the flame of Adonai.", "7": "Many waters cannot quench love, nor rivers wash it away. If one gave all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly despised.", "8": "We have a little sister, still without breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?", "9": "If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door, we will fence her in with cedar plank.", "10": "I am a wall, and my breasts like towers.

Each was to bring for his fruit a thousand pieces of silver.", "12": "My very own vineyard is before me.

Let me hear it!", "14": "Come quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!"}

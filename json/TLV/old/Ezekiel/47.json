{"1": "Then he brought me back to the door of the House. Behold, water was flowing out from under the threshold of the House eastward\u2014for the front of the House faced east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the House, south of the altar. ", "2": "He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around outside by the way of the outer gate, the way of the gate looking east. Behold, water was trickling out from the right side.", "3": "When the man went out eastward with a line in his hand, he measured a 1,000 cubits. Then he led me into the water\u2014water to the ankles. ", "4": "Again he measured a 1,000, and led me into the water\u2014water to the knees. Again he measured a 1,000, and he led me into the water\u2014water up to the waist. ", "5": "Again he measured a 1,000, and now it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen, water to swim in\u2014a river that could not be crossed. ", "6": "He said to me, \u201cHave you seen this, son of man?\u201d Then he brought me back to the bank of the river. ", "7": "When I had returned, behold, there were very many trees on one side and on the other, along the bank of the river.", "8": "[a] 8\u00a0Then he said to me, \u201cThese waters go out toward the eastern region. They go down to the Arabah and enter the sea. When they arrive at the sea, the waters of the sea will flow and will become fresh.", "9": "[b] 9\u00a0It will be that every living creature that swarms will live wherever the rivers go. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because this water goes there and makes the salt water fresh. So everything will be healed and live wherever the river goes. ", "10": "Fishermen will stand by it; from En-gedi to En-eglaim, it will be a place for spreading of nets. Their fish will be of many different kinds\u2014like the fish of the Great Sea, a huge quantity. ", "11": "Its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be set aside for salt. ", "12": "On the river, on its bank, on this side and that side, will grow every kind of tree for food. Its leaf will not wither; its fruit will not fail; it will bear new fruit every month, because its water flows out from the Sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food and its leaf will be for healing.\u201d", "13": "Thus says Adonai Elohim, \u201cThis will be the border, by which you will divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel, Joseph receiving two portions. ", "14": "You will inherit it, each one like another, as I lifted My hand to give to your fathers. So this land will fall to you as an inheritance.", "15": "\u201cThis will be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea, by way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad\u2014", "16": "Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. ", "17": "So the border from the sea will be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern side.", "18": "The east side, between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead and the land of Israel, will be by the Jordan. You will measure from the northern border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern side.", "19": "The south side southward will be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the Wadi of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This will be the southern side toward the south.", "20": "The west side will be the Great Sea, from the southern border as far as the front of the entrance of Hamath. This will be the western side.", "21": "You are to divide this land for yourselves to the tribes of Israel. ", "22": "So you are to divide it by lot for an inheritance for you and for the outsiders who dwell among you, whoever bears children among you. They will be to you like the native-born of Bnei-Yisrael; they will be allotted an inheritance along with you among the tribes of Israel. ", "23": "In whatever tribe the outsider lives, there you will give him his inheritance.\u201d It is a declaration of Adonai."}

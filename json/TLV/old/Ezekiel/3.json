Then go, speak to the house of Israel.\u201d ", "2": "So I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat, ", "3": "as He said to me, \u201cSon of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.\u201d I ate it and it tasted as sweet as honey.", "4": "Then He said to me, \u201cSon of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them. ", "5": "For you are not sent to a people of unintelligible speech and difficult tongue, but to the house of Israel, ", "6": "nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult tongue, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. ", "7": "But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel has a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. ", "8": "Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.

", "15": "I came to the exiles at Tel-Abib who lived by the river Chebar. I sat where they were dwelling. I sat there overwhelmed among them for seven days.", "16": "Now at the end of seven days, the word of Adonai came to me saying: ", "17": "\u201cSon of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me. ", "18": "When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak to warn the wicked of his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked person will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood from your hand. ", "19": "Yet you, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.

Then He spoke with me and said to me: \u201cGo, shut yourself in your house. ", "25": "You, son of man, behold, ropes will be put on you. You will be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people. ", "26": "I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth. You will be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house. ", "27": "But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth. You will say to them: 'Thus says Adonai Elohim.' he that hears, let him hear. He that refuses to hear, let him refuse\u2014for they are a rebellious house.\u201d"}

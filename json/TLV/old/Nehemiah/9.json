They enjoyed Your great goodness.", "26": "\u201cNonetheless they became contentious and rebelled against You. They cast Your Torah behind their back. They killed Your prophets who warned them[c] to return to You; they committed appalling blasphemies. ", "27": "Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies who oppressed them.

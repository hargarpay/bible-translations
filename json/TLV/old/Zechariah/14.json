The city shall be captured, the houses ransacked and the women ravished. Half of the city will be exiled but the remainder of the people will not be cut off from the city. ", "3": "Then Adonai will go forth and fight against those nations as He fights in a day of battle. ", "4": "In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a huge valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north and half of it toward the south. ", "5": "Then you will flee through My mountain valley because the mountain valley will reach to Azel. Yes, you will flee like you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. Then Adonai my God will come and all the kedoshim with Him.[a]", "6": "In that day there will be no light, cold or frost.

In that day Adonai will be Echad and His Name Echad.[d]", "10": "The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. Jerusalem will be raised up and occupy her place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. ", "11": "People will dwell in her, and no longer will there be a ban of destruction\u2014Jerusalem will live in security.", "12": "Now this is the plague with which Adonai will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets; and their tongues will rot in their mouths. ", "13": "It will happen in that day that a great panic from Adonai will be among them. Each person will seize the hand of his neighbor and they will attack each other.

", "17": "Furthermore, if any of the nations on earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Adonai-Tzva'ot, they will have no rain. ", "18": "If the Egyptians do not go up and celebrate, they will have no rain. Instead, there will be the plague that Adonai will inflict on the nations that do not go up to celebrate Sukkot. ", "19": "This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate Sukkot. ", "20": "In that day \u201cHoly to Adonai\u201d will be inscribed on the bells of the horses and the pots in House of Adonai will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.

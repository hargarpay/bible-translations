{"1": "Open your gates, Lebanon\u2014 fire will devour your cedars!", "2": "Wail, cypress tree! For the cedar has fallen. Those majestic ones are devastated. Wail, oaks of Bashan! For the thick forest is cut down!", "3": "Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed! Listen to the roaring of young lions, for Jordan's thickets are ruined!", "4": "Thus said Adonai my God: \u201cShepherd the flock marked for slaughter! ", "5": "Their buyers slay them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, 'Blessed be Adonai, for I am rich!' Their own shepherds do not spare them. ", "6": "I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land\u201d\u2014it is a declaration of Adonai. \u201cBehold, I will hand everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not deliver them from their hand.\u201d", "7": "So I pastured the flock for the slaughter, especially the afflicted of the flock. Then I took two staffs\u2014one I called Favor and the other I called Union\u2014and I pastured the flock. ", "8": "Next I disposed of the three shepherds in one month\u2014for my soul was impatient with them and their soul also detested me. ", "9": "Then I said, \u201cI will not shepherd you! Let the dying die, let the perishing perish, and let those who are left eat one another's flesh!\u201d ", "10": "So I took my staff called Favor and broke it to pieces, in order to break my covenant that I made with all people. ", "11": "It was broken on that day. The afflicted of the flock that were watching me knew that this was the word of Adonai.\u201d", "12": "Then I said to them, \u201cIf it seems good to you, pay me my wages, but if not, don't bother!\u201d So they weighed out my wages\u201430 pieces of silver.[a]", "13": "Then Adonai said to me, \u201cThrow it to the potter\u2014that exorbitant price at which they valued Me!\u201d So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw them into the House of Adonai, to the potter.[b]", "14": "Then I broke my second staff called Union, in order to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. ", "15": "Again Adonai said to me, \u201cOnce more take up the equipment of a foolish shepherd! ", "16": "For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the dying, seek out the young or heal the injured or nourish the healthy. Instead he will eat the meat of the choice sheep, even tearing off their hoofs.\u201d", "17": "Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock![c] May a sword fell his arm and his right eye! May his arm be all withered and his right eye totally blinded!\u201d"}

", "7": "But when they cried out to Adonai, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, then He brought the sea upon them, and it covered them; and your eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians. Then you stayed in the wilderness for a long time.", "8": "\u201cThen I brought you to the land of the Amorites who were living beyond the Jordan.

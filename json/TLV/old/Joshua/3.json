", "4": "Yet keep a distance between you and it of about 2,000 cubits by measure. Don't come near it, so you may know the way by which you should go, for you haven't travelled this way before.\u201d", "5": "Then Joshua told the people, \u201cConsecrate yourselves, for tomorrow Adonai will do wonders in your midst.\u201d ", "6": "Joshua spoke to the kohanim saying: \u201cTake up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.\u201d So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.", "7": "Now Adonai said to Joshua, \u201cThis day I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.

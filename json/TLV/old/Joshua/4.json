", "5": "Joshua said to them, \u201cCross over before the ark of Adonai your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you, lift up a stone on his shoulder, for the number of the tribes of Bnei-Yisrael. ", "6": "Let this be a sign among you. When your children ask later saying, 'What do these stones mean to you?' ", "7": "then you will say to them: 'Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Adonai\u2014when it crossed the Jordan\u2014the waters of the Jordan were cut off.' So these stones will be a reminder to Bnei-Yisrael forever.\u201d", "8": "So Bnei-Yisrael did so, as Joshua commanded. They lifted twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as Adonai had said to Joshua, for the number of the tribes of Bnei-Yisrael. Then they carried them over with them to the lodging place and put them down there. ", "9": "Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the spot where the feet of the kohanim carrying the ark of the covenant were standing\u2014they are there to this day.", "10": "The kohanim who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Adonai had commanded Joshua to speak to the people was completed, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people hurried across, ", "11": "and when all the people had finished crossing over, the ark of Adonai and the kohanim crossed over in the presence of the people. ", "12": "Also the children of Reuben, the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed ahead of Bnei-Yisrael, just as Moses had said to them\u2014", "13": "about 40,000 equipped for war crossed over before Adonai for battle to the plains of Jericho.", "14": "On that day Adonai exalted Joshua in the eyes of all Israel.

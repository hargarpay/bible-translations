{"1": "\u201cHear, O Israel! You are about to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself\u2014cities great and fortified up to the heavens. ", "2": "The people are great and tall, sons of the Anakim. You know them, and you yourselves have heard, \u201cWho can stand before the sons of Anak?\u201d ", "3": "But you will know today that Adonai your God is the One who is crossing over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them, and He will bring them down before you, so that you may drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Adonai has promised you.", "4": "\u201cAfter Adonai your God has driven them out from before you, do not say in your heart, 'It is because of my righteousness that Adonai has brought me in to possess this land.' It is because of the wickedness of these nations that Adonai is driving them out from before you. ", "5": "It is not by your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to possess their land. Rather, because of the wickedness of these nations, Adonai your God is driving them out from before you, and in order to keep the word Adonai swore to your fathers\u2014to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. ", "6": "So you should understand that it is not because of your righteousness that Adonai your God is giving you this good land to possess\u2014for you are a stiff-necked people.", "7": "\u201cRemember, never forget, how you provoked Adonai your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Adonai. ", "8": "At Horeb you provoked Adonai to wrath, and Adonai was angry with you\u2014enough to destroy you. ", "9": "When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that Adonai cut with you, I stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights; I did not eat bread or drink water. ", "10": "Adonai gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God. Moreover, on them were all the words that Adonai had spoken with you on the mountain from the midst of the fire, on the day of the assembly.", "11": "\u201cNow at the end of 40 days and 40 nights, Adonai gave me the two tablets of stone\u2014the tablets of the covenant. ", "12": "Adonai said to me, 'Get up! Go quickly down from here, for your people whom you brought out from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves.' ", "13": "Furthermore Adonai spoke to me saying, 'I have seen this people, and it is indeed a stiff-necked people. ", "14": "Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens. Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they.'", "15": "\u201cSo I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire. Now the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. ", "16": "When I looked, you had indeed sinned against Adonai your God\u2014you had made yourselves a metal calf. So quickly you had turned aside from the way Adonai had commanded you! ", "17": "So I took hold of the two tablets, threw them out of my two hands, and smashed them before your eyes.", "18": "\u201cThen I fell down before Adonai like the first time, for 40 days and 40 nights. I did not eat bread or drink water\u2014because of all your sin that you committed, doing evil in Adonai's sight, provoking Him to anger. ", "19": "For I was afraid of the fierce wrath and fury which Adonai bore toward you\u2014to destroy you.[a] But Adonai listened to me that time also. ", "20": "Adonai was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. ", "21": "I took your sin\u2014the calf you had made\u2014and burned it in the fire. I crushed it, grinding it up so well that it was as fine as dust, and I threw its dust into the wadi flowing down from the mountain.", "22": "\u201cAgain at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked Adonai to wrath. ", "23": "When Adonai sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and possess the land I have given you,' then you rebelled against the commandment of Adonai your God and didn't believe Him or listen to His voice. ", "24": "You have been rebellious against Adonai from the day that I knew you.", "25": "\u201cSo I threw myself down before Adonai those 40 days and 40 nights, because Adonai had said He would destroy you. ", "26": "I prayed to Adonai and said, 'O Lord, Adonai, do not destroy Your people\u2014Your inheritance that You have redeemed through Your greatness and brought out from Egypt with a mighty hand. ", "27": "Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people or to their wickedness or their sin. ", "28": "Otherwise the land from which You brought us out may say, \u201cBecause Adonai was not able to bring them into the land that He spoke of to them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.\u201d ", "29": "Yet they are Your people\u2014Your inheritance that You brought out by Your great power and Your outstretched arm.'"}

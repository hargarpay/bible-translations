Yes, indeed I have cursed them, because you did not take it to heart.", "3": "Behold, I am rebuking the seed on account of you, and will spread dung on your faces \u2014the dung of your festivals\u2014 and take you away together with it.", "4": "Then you will know that I have sent this command to you, to be My covenant with Levi,\u201d says Adonai-Tzva'ot.", "5": "\u201cMy covenant was with him for life and shalom, and I gave them to him for reverence. So he revered Me, and he was awestruck by My Name.", "6": "Instruction of truth was in his mouth. Injustice was not found on his lips. In shalom and uprightness he walked with Me, and he turned many from iniquity.", "7": "For a kohen's lips should guard knowledge, and instruction must be sought from his mouth.

But you say: \u201cHow have you loved us?\u201d \u201cWas Esau not Jacob's brother?\u201d \u2014it is the declaration of Adonai\u2014 \u201cYet I loved Jacob ", "3": "and Esau I hated. I made his hills a wasteland and gave his inheritance to jackals of the wilderness.\u201d", "4": "For Edom may say, \u201cWe have been beaten down, but we will return and rebuild the ruins.\u201d Thus Adonai-Tzva'ot says: \u201cThey may rebuild but I will tear down. They will be called a wicked territory, the people Adonai denounced forever.", "5": "So you will see, and you will say: 'May Adonai be magnified beyond the border of Israel!'\u201d", "6": "\u201cA son honors his father, and a servant his master.

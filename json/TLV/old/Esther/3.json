", "2": "All the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded it.

Therefore they told Haman in order to see whether Mordecai's resolve would prevail, for he had told them that he was a Jew.", "5": "When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing down or paying him honor, Haman was filled with rage. ", "6": "But it was repugnant in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him the identity of Mordecai's people. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.", "7": "In the first month (that is the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast the pur (that is, 'the lot') in the presence of Haman from day to day and month to month, up to the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.", "8": "Haman then said to King Ahasuerus: \u201cThere is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of every other people and who do not obey the king's laws. It is not in the king's interest to tolerate them. ", "9": "If it pleases the king, let an edict be written to destroy them.

Everything Haman commanded was written to the king's provincial governors, and to the officials who were in every province, and to the officials of every people, province by province, according to its script and people by people according to its language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring.

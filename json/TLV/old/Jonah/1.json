He went down to Jaffa and found a ship going to Tarshish, paid the fee and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish\u2014away from the presence of Adonai.", "4": "Then Adonai hurled a forceful wind into the sea and there was such a mighty storm on the sea that the ship was about to shatter. ", "5": "So the sailors were afraid and cried out, each man to his own god. Then they cast the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest part of the ship, to lay down and fell fast asleep.", "6": "So the chief sailor came near to him and said to him, \u201cWhat, are you sleeping? Get up! Call out to your god. Perhaps the gods will consider us, so we will not perish!\u201d", "7": "Then each man said to his companion, \u201cCome, let's cast lots\u2014so we may know because of whom this evil is happening to us.\u201d So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.[b]", "8": "Then they said to him, \u201cTell us, now! On whose account is this evil happening to us? What is your profession and where did you come from? What is your land and from what nation are you?\u201d", "9": "He said to them, \u201cI am a Hebrew and I fear Adonai God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land.\u201d", "10": "Then the men became afraid with an overwhelming fear and they said to him, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d For the men knew that he had fled from the presence of Adonai, because he had told them.

For I know it is because of me that this great storm is upon you.\u201d", "13": "Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to the land, but they could not, because the sea kept raging against them. ", "14": "So they cried to Adonai and said, \u201cPlease, Adonai, don't let us perish on account of the soul of this man and don't put innocent blood on us. For you, Adonai, have done as you pleased.\u201d", "15": "So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea\u2014and the sea stilled from its raging.

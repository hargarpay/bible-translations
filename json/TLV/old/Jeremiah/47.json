{"1": "The word of Adonai that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza. ", "2": "Thus says Adonai: \u201cLook, waters rising from the north will become an overflowing torrent, and overflow the land and all in it, the city and those dwelling in it and the men will cry, and every inhabitant of the land wail.", "3": "The noise\u2014 the stomping hooves of his stallions, the rumbling of his chariots, the reverberation of his wheels! Fathers will not turn back for their children because of their limp hands.", "4": "For the day is coming to devastate all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally. For Adonai will destroy the Philistines, the rest of the island of Caphtor.", "5": "Baldness has come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is ruined. O remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourself?", "6": "O sword of Adonai, how long until you are quiet? Go back into your sheath, rest and be still.", "7": "How can you be quiet when Adonai has commanded? He has assigned it against Ashkelon and against the coast of the sea."}

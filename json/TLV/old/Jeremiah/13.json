", "3": "Then the word of Adonai came to me a second time, saying: ", "4": "\u201cTake the waistband that you bought, which is on your waist, and get up, go to Perath[a] and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.\u201d", "5": "So I went and hid it at Perath, as Adonai commanded me. ", "6": "Now it came to pass after many days that Adonai said to me: \u201cGet up, go to Perath, and take the waistband that I commanded you to hide there.\u201d ", "7": "So I went to Perath, dug it up and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. But to my surprise, the waistband was marred, worth nothing at all.", "8": "Then the word of Adonai came to me, saying, ", "9": "thus says Adonai: \u201cJust so I will mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. ", "10": "This wicked people, who refuse to hear My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their own heart, and go after other gods to serve them and worship them, will be just like this waistband\u2014worth nothing at all.

But they would not obey.\u201d", "12": "Moreover, speak this word to them, thus says Adonai, the God of Israel: \u201cEvery jug should be filled with wine.\u201d When they say to you, 'Don't we know very well that every jug should be filled with wine?'

'I will show no pity, nor regret, nor compassion, to keep Me from destroying them.'\u201d", "15": "Hear and give ear! o not be haughty! For Adonai has spoken.", "16": "Give glory to Adonai your God, before it grows dark, and before your feet stumble on mountains at dusk. When you look for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, and turns it into deep darkness.", "17": "But if you will not listen, my soul will sob in secret before such pride, and my eyes will weep bitterly and overflow with tears, for Adonai's flock will be taken captive.", "18": "Say to the king and the queen mother: \u201cSit down low, for your glorious crown has fallen from your head.\u201d", "19": "The towns of the South will be shut up, with no one to open them.

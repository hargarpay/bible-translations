", "3": "Thus says Adonai: 'Execute justice and righteousness. Rescue the one who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the fatherless or the widow. Do not shed innocent blood in this place. ", "4": "For if you really carry out this word, then through the gates of this palace will enter kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses\u2014himself, his servants, and his people. ", "5": "But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself,' declares Adonai, 'that this palace will become a ruin.'\u201d", "6": "For thus says Adonai concerning the house of the king of Judah: \u201cYou are Gilead to Me\u2014 the summit of Lebanon, yet I will surely make you into a wilderness, uninhabited cities.", "7": "I will consecrate destroyers against you, each with his own weapons.

For they are all adulterers, a bunch of traitors.", "2": "They bend their tongue like a bow. Lies, not faithfulness, prevail in the land. \u201cFor they go from evil to evil and do not know Me,\u201d says Adonai.", "3": "Beware, everyone, of your neighbor! Don't even trust a brother. For every brother grabs like Jacob and every neighbor spreads slander.", "4": "Everyone deceives his neighbor and does not speak the truth. They taught their tongue to speak lies. They wear themselves out doing wrong.", "5": "\u201cYou dwell in the midst of deceit. In deceit they refuse to know Me.\u201d It is a declaration of Adonai.", "6": "Therefore thus says Adonai-Tzva'ot: \u201cI am about to refine them and test them. For what else can I do for the daughter of My people?", "7": "Their tongue is a deadly arrow, speaking deceit. With his mouth each says shalom to his neighbor, while inwardly setting a trap for him.", "8": "For such things shall I not punish them?\u201d It is a declaration of Adonai. \u201cShould I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?\u201d", "9": "For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, a lament for the desert pastures.

They have neither obeyed My voice nor walked according to it, ", "13": "but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baalim that their fathers taught them. ", "14": "Therefore, thus says Adonai-Tzva'ot, the God of Israel, \u201clook, I will make this people eat wormwood and drink poisoned water.

I will pursue them with the sword, until I have finished with them.\u201d", "16": "Thus says Adonai-Tzva'ot: \u201cPay attention! Call the dirge-singers and let them come.

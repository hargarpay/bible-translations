Then you will be My people, and I will be your God.", "5": "[a] 5\u00a0Then I will fulfill the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is today.'\u201d In response I said, \u201cAmen, Adonai.\u201d", "6": "Then Adonai said to me: \u201cProclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: 'Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.'

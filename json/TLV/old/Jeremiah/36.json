Then I would forgive their iniquity and their sin.\u201d", "4": "So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from Jeremiah's mouth, all the words that Adonai had spoken to him, into a megillah scroll.

", "6": "So you go and read in the megillah\u2014which you have written from my mouth, the words of Adonai\u2014in the ears of the people, in the House of Adonai, on a fast day. You should also read them in the ears of all Judah coming from their towns. ", "7": "Perhaps they will present their supplication before Adonai, and each one will turn from his wicked way. For great is the anger and fury that Adonai has pronounced against this people.\u201d", "8": "So Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that the prophet Jeremiah commanded him, reading from the book the words of Adonai in the House of Adonai.", "9": "Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of King Josiah of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before Adonai\u2014all the people in Jerusalem and all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.

", "24": "Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words were afraid, nor tore their clothes. ", "25": "Moreover Elnatan, Delaiah and Gemariah entreated the king not to burn the megillah, but he would not listen to them.", "26": "Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, along with Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah\u2014but Adonai hid them.", "27": "Then the word of Adonai came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the megillah with the words that Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying: ", "28": "\u201cTake yet another megillah, and write in it all the original words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned up.

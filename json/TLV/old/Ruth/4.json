And all of a sudden, the goel about whom Boaz had spoken passed by. \u201cCome over,\u201d he called, \u201cand sit down here, my friend.\u201d So he came over and sat down.", "2": "Then Boaz took ten of the town's elders and said, \u201cSit down here,\u201d so they sat down. ", "3": "Then he said to the goel, \u201cNaomi, who has returned from the region of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belongs to our brother Elimelech. ", "4": "I thought I should inform you saying, 'Buy it in the presence of the people sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, redeem it. But if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, so that I can know, because there is no one else in line to redeem it. I am after you.'\u201d \u201cI will redeem it,\u201d he said.", "5": "Then Boaz said, \u201cOn the day you buy the field from Naomi's hand, you will also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased over his inheritance.\u201d", "6": "The kinsman said, \u201cThen I cannot redeem it for myself, or else I might endanger my own inheritance. You, take my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.\u201d", "7": "Now in the past in Israel, one removed his sandal and gave it to another, in order to finalize the redemption and transfer of a matter.

You are witnesses today.\u201d", "11": "All the people at the gate and the elders said, \u201cWe are witnesses. May Adonai make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, who both built up the house of Israel. May you prosper in Ephrath and be renowned in Bethlehem.

When he went to her, Adonai enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. ", "14": "Then the women said to Naomi, \u201cBlessed be Adonai, who has not left you without a goel today. May his name be famous throughout Israel. ", "15": "Moreover, He will be to you a renewer of life and a sustainer of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.\u201d", "16": "Naomi took the child and held it to her bosom, and took care of him.

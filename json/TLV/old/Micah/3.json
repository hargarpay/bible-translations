{"1": "Then I said: \u201cHear, leaders of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice?", "2": "You haters of good and lovers of evil, you are robbing their skin from them and their flesh from their bones.\u201d", "3": "Now that they have eaten the flesh of my people, stripped their skin off from them, and smashed their bones to bits, they cut it up like flesh in a pot, or like meat within a caldron.", "4": "Then they will cry out to Adonai, but He will not answer them. Thus He will hide His face from them at that time, because of their evil deeds.", "5": "Thus said Adonai about the prophets who are misleading My people, those who bite with their teeth and cry \u201cShalom\u201d \u2014a word that He did not put in their mouth\u2014 yet they consecrate war against him:", "6": "\u201cTherefore you will have night without vision, and darkness without divination. The sun shall set on the prophets, the day shall become dark upon them.\u201d", "7": "So the seers will be ashamed and the diviners will be abashed. Indeed all of them will cover their lips, for there will be no answer from God.", "8": "Nevertheless I myself am filled with power\u2014 with the Ruach Adonai\u2014 with judgment, and with might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.", "9": "Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel: You who abhor justice, and twist everything upright,", "10": "who build up Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with injustice.", "11": "Her leaders give judgment for a bribe. Her priests give direction for a price. Her prophets practice divination for money. Yet they lean on Adonai by saying: \u201cIs not Adonai in our midst? No calamity will come upon us!\u201d", "12": "Therefore, because of you Zion will become a plowed field. Yes, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the Temple Mount will become a high place in a forest."}

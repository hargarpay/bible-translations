", "2": "He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: ", "3": "\u201cListen! Consider the sower who went out to sow. ", "4": "As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. ", "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground where it didn't have much soil, and it grew up quickly, since the soil wasn't deep. ", "6": "When the sun came up, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away. ", "7": "Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it didn't produce fruit. ", "8": "Still other seed fell on good ground and it grew up, producing fruit that increased thirty, sixty, and a hundred times.\u201d ", "9": "Then he said, \u201cLet anyone who has ears to hear listen.\u201d", "10": "When he was alone, those around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. ", "11": "He answered them, \u201cThe secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables ", "12": "so that they may indeed look, and yet not perceive; they may indeed listen, and yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back and be forgiven.\u201d[a][b] ", "13": "Then he said to them: \u201cDon't you understand this parable? How then will you understand all of the parables? ", "14": "The sower sows the word. ", "15": "Some are like the word sown on the path. When they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word sown in them.[c] ", "16": "And others are like seed sown on rocky ground. When they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy. ", "17": "But they have no root; they are short-lived. When distress or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately fall away. ", "18": "Others are like seed sown among thorns; these are the ones who hear the word, ", "19": "but the worries of this age, the deceitfulness[d] of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. ", "20": "And those like seed sown on good ground hear the word, welcome it, and produce fruit thirty, sixty, and a hundred times what was sown.\u201d", "21": "He also said to them, \u201cIs a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it to be put on a lampstand? ", "22": "For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light. ", "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen.\u201d ", "24": "And he said to them, \u201cPay attention to what you hear. By the measure you use, it will be measured to you\u2014and more will be added to you.

", "27": "He sleeps and rises night and day; the seed sprouts and grows, although he doesn't know how. ", "28": "The soil produces a crop by itself\u2014first the blade, then the head, and then the full grain on the head. ", "29": "As soon as the crop is ready, he sends for the sickle, because the harvest has come.\u201d", "30": "And he said, \u201cWith what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to describe it? ", "31": "It's like a mustard seed that, when sown upon the soil, is the smallest of all the seeds on the ground. ", "32": "And when sown, it comes up and grows taller than all the garden plants, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the sky can nest in its shade.\u201d", "33": "He was speaking the word to them with many parables like these, as they were able to understand. ", "34": "He did not speak to them without a parable. Privately, however, he explained everything to his own disciples.", "35": "On that day, when evening had come, he told them, \u201cLet's cross over to the other side of the sea.\u201d ", "36": "So they left the crowd and took him along since he was in the boat.

Don't you care that we're going to die?\u201d ", "39": "He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, \u201cSilence! Be still!\u201d The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

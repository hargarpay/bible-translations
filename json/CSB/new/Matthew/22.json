Come to the wedding banquet.'", "5": "\u201cBut they paid no attention and went away, one to his own farm, another to his business, ", "6": "while the rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them. ", "7": "The king[a] was enraged, and he sent out his troops, killed those murderers, and burned down their city.", "8": "\u201cThen he told his servants, 'The banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. ", "9": "Go then to where the roads exit the city and invite everyone you find to the banquet.' ", "10": "So those servants went out on the roads and gathered everyone they found, both evil and good. The wedding banquet[b] was filled with guests.[c] ", "11": "When the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed for a wedding.

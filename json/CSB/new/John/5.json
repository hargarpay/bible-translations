{"1": "After this, a Jewish festival took place, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ", "2": "By the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there is a pool, called Bethesda[a] in Aramaic, which has five colonnades. ", "3": "Within these lay a large number of the disabled\u2014blind, lame, and paralyzed.[b]", "5": "One man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. ", "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and realized he had already been there a long time, he said to him, \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d", "7": "\u201cSir,\u201d the disabled man answered, \u201cI have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, someone goes down ahead of me.\u201d", "8": "\u201cGet up,\u201d Jesus told him, \u201cpick up your mat and walk.\u201d ", "9": "Instantly the man got well, picked up his mat, and started to walk. Now that day was the Sabbath, ", "10": "and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \u201cThis is the Sabbath. The law prohibits you from picking up your mat.\u201d", "11": "He replied, \u201cThe man who made me well told me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\u201d", "12": "\u201cWho is this man who told you, 'Pick up your mat and walk'?\u201d they asked.

For whatever the Father[e] does, the Son likewise does these things.

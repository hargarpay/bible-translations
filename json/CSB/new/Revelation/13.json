On its horns were ten crowns,[a] and on its heads were blasphemous names.[b] ", "2": "The beast I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority. ", "3": "One of its heads appeared to be fatally wounded, but its fatal wound was healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast. ", "4": "They worshiped the dragon because he gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, \u201cWho is like the beast? Who is able to wage war against it?\u201d", "5": "The beast was given a mouth to utter boasts and blasphemies. It was allowed to exercise authority[c][d] for forty-two months. ", "6": "It began to speak[e] blasphemies against God: to blaspheme his name and his dwelling\u2014those who dwell in heaven. ", "7": "And it was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. It was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.

", "14": "It deceives those who live on the earth because of the signs that it is permitted to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who live on the earth to make an image[k] of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.

Its number is 666.[o]"}

Nothing leavened may be eaten. ", "4": "Today, in the month of Abib,[a] you are going out. ", "5": "When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hethites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites,[b] which he swore to your fathers that he would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you must carry out this ceremony in this month.

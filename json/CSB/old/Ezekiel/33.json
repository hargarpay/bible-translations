", "3": "And suppose he sees the sword coming against the land and blows his trumpet to warn the people. ", "4": "Then, if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet but ignores the warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his death will be his own fault.[a] ", "5": "Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but ignored the warning, his death is his own fault.[b] If he had taken warning, he would have saved his life. ", "6": "However, suppose the watchman sees the sword coming but doesn't blow the trumpet, so that the people aren't warned, and the sword comes and takes away their lives. Then they have been taken away because of their iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.'", "7": "\u201cAs for you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel.

Why will you die, house of Israel?'", "12": "\u201cNow, son of man, say to your people, 'The righteousness of the righteous person will not save him on the day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked person cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness.

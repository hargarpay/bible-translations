", "3": "\u201cSon of man,\u201d he said to me, \u201cfeed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I am giving you.\u201d So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.", "4": "Then he said to me: \u201cSon of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. ", "5": "For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or a difficult language but to the house of Israel\u2014", "6": "not to the many peoples of unintelligible speech or a difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. No doubt, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. ", "7": "But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to me. For the whole house of Israel is hardheaded and hardhearted. ", "8": "Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.

Don't be afraid of them or discouraged by the look on their faces, though they are a rebellious house.\u201d", "10": "Next he said to me: \u201cSon of man, listen carefully to all my words that I speak to you and take them to heart.

", "15": "I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were living by the Chebar Canal, and I sat there among them stunned for seven days.", "16": "Now at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me: ", "17": "\u201cSon of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, give them a warning from me.

Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood. ", "19": "But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have rescued yourself.

Let the one who listens, listen, and let the one who refuses, refuse\u2014for they are a rebellious house."}

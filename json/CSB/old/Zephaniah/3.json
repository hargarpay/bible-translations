{"1": "Woe to the city that is rebellious[a] and defiled, the oppressive city!", "2": "She has not obeyed; she has not accepted discipline. She has not trusted in the Lord; she has not drawn near to her God.", "3": "The[b] princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the night, which leave nothing for[c] the morning.", "4": "Her prophets are reckless\u2014 treacherous men. Her priests profane the sanctuary; they do violence to instruction.", "5": "The righteous Lord is in her; he does no wrong. He applies his justice morning by morning; he does not fail at dawn, yet the one who does wrong knows no shame.", "6": "I have cut off nations; their corner towers are destroyed. I have laid waste their streets, with no one to pass through. Their cities lie devastated, without a person, without an inhabitant.", "7": "I thought: You will certainly fear me and accept correction. Then her dwelling place[d] would not be cut off based on all that I had allocated to her. However, they became more corrupt in all their actions.", "8": "Therefore, wait for me\u2014 this is the Lord's declaration\u2014 until the day I rise up for plunder.[e] For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, in order to pour out my indignation on them, all my burning anger; for the whole earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy.", "9": "For I will then restore pure speech to the peoples so that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him with a single purpose.[f]", "10": "From beyond the rivers of Cush my supplicants, my dispersed people, will bring an offering to me.", "11": "On that day you[g] will not be put to shame because of everything you have done in rebelling against me. For then I will remove from among you your jubilant, arrogant people, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain.", "12": "I will leave a meek and humble people among you, and they will take refuge in the name of the Lord.", "13": "The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong or tell lies; a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will pasture and lie down, with nothing to make them afraid.", "14": "Sing for joy, Daughter Zion; shout loudly, Israel! Be glad and celebrate with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!", "15": "The Lord has removed your punishment; he has turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, the Lord, is among you; you need no longer fear harm.", "16": "On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: \u201cDo not fear; Zion, do not let your hands grow weak.", "17": "The Lord your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet[h] in his love. He will delight in you with singing.\u201d", "18": "I will gather those who have been driven from the appointed festivals; they will be a tribute from you[i] and a reproach on her.[j]", "19": "Yes, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the outcasts; I will make those who were disgraced throughout the earth receive praise and fame.", "20": "At that time I will bring you[k] back, yes, at the time I will gather you. I will give you fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes. The Lord has spoken."}

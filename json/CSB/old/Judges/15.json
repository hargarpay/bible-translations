{"1": "Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat as a gift and visited his wife. \u201cI want to go to my wife in her room,\u201d he said. But her father would not let him enter.", "2": "\u201cI was sure you hated her,\u201d her father said, \u201cso I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she is? Why not take her instead?\u201d", "3": "Samson said to them, \u201cThis time I will be blameless when I harm the Philistines.\u201d ", "4": "So he went out and caught three hundred foxes. He took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails. ", "5": "Then he ignited the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned the piles of grain and the standing grain as well as the vineyards and olive groves.", "6": "Then the Philistines asked, \u201cWho did this?\u201d They were told, \u201cIt was Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because he took Samson's wife and gave her to his companion.\u201d So the Philistines went to her and her father and burned them to death.", "7": "Then Samson told them, \u201cBecause you did this, I swear that I won't rest until I have taken vengeance on you.\u201d ", "8": "He tore them limb from limb[a] and then went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam.", "9": "The Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and raided Lehi. ", "10": "So the men of Judah said, \u201cWhy have you attacked us?\u201d They replied, \u201cWe have come to tie Samson up and pay him back for what he did to us.\u201d", "11": "Then three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, \u201cDon't you realize that the Philistines rule us? What have you done to us?\u201d \u201cI have done to them what they did to me,\u201d he answered.[b]", "12": "They said to him, \u201cWe've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.\u201d Then Samson told them, \u201cSwear to me that you yourselves won't kill me.\u201d", "13": "\u201cNo,\u201d they said,[c] \u201cwe won't kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them.\u201d So they tied him up with two new ropes and led him away from the rock.", "14": "When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him shouting. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on him, and the ropes that were on his arms and wrists became like burnt flax and fell off. ", "15": "He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand, took it, and killed a thousand men with it. ", "16": "Then Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey I have piled them in heaps. With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed a thousand men.", "17": "When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone and named that place Ramath-lehi.[d] ", "18": "He became very thirsty and called out to the Lord: \u201cYou have accomplished this great victory through your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?\u201d ", "19": "So God split a hollow place in the ground at Lehi, and water came out of it. After Samson drank, his strength returned, and he revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore,[e] which is still in Lehi today. ", "20": "And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines."}

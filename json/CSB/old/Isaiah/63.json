It is I, proclaiming vindication,[b] powerful to save.", "2": "Why are your clothes red, and your garments like one who treads a winepress?", "3": "I trampled the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with me. I trampled them in my anger and ground them underfoot in my fury; their blood spattered my garments, and all my clothes were stained.", "4": "For I planned the day of vengeance, and the year of my redemption[c] came.", "5": "I looked, but there was no one to help, and I was amazed that no one assisted; so my arm accomplished victory for me, and my wrath assisted me.", "6": "I crushed nations in my anger; I made them drunk with my wrath and poured out their blood on the ground.", "7": "I will make known the Lord's faithful love and the Lord's praiseworthy acts, because of all the Lord has done for us\u2014 even the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, which he did for them based on his compassion and the abundance of his faithful love.", "8": "He said, \u201cThey are indeed my people, children who will not be disloyal,\u201d and he became their Savior.", "9": "In all their suffering, he suffered,[d] and the angel of his presence saved them.

You, Lord, are our Father; your name is Our Redeemer from Ancient Times.", "17": "Why, Lord, do you make us stray from your ways? You harden our hearts so we do not fear[i] you.

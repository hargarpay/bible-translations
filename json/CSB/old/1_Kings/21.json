{"1": "Some time passed after these events. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard; it was in Jezreel next to the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. ", "2": "So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, \u201cGive me your vineyard so I can have it for a vegetable garden, since it is right next to my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer, I will give you its value in silver.\u201d", "3": "But Naboth said to Ahab, \u201cI will never give my fathers' inheritance to you.\u201d", "4": "So Ahab went to his palace resentful and angry because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had told him. He had said, \u201cI will not give you my fathers' inheritance.\u201d He lay down on his bed, turned his face away, and didn't eat any food.", "5": "Then his wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, \u201cWhy are you so upset that you refuse to eat?\u201d", "6": "\u201cBecause I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,\u201d he replied. \u201cI told him: Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you a vineyard in its place. But he said, 'I won't give you my vineyard!'\u201d", "7": "Then his wife Jezebel said to him, \u201cNow, exercise your royal power over Israel. Get up, eat some food, and be happy. For I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\u201d ", "8": "So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. ", "9": "In the letters, she wrote: Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people.

He's in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. ", "19": "Tell him, 'This is what the Lord says: Have you murdered and also taken possession?'  Then tell him, 'This is what the Lord says: In the place where the dogs licked up Naboth's blood, the dogs will also lick up your blood!'\u201d ", "20": "Ahab said to Elijah, \u201cSo, my enemy, you've found me, have you?\u201d  He replied, \u201cI have found you because you devoted yourself to do what is evil in the Lord's sight.

He lay down in sackcloth and walked around subdued. ", "28": "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite: ", "29": "\u201cHave you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? I will not bring the disaster during his lifetime, because he has humbled himself before me. I will bring the disaster on his house during his son's lifetime.\u201d"}

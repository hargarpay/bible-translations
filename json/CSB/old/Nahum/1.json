The Lord takes vengeance against his foes; he is furious with his enemies.", "3": "The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will never leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath his feet.", "4": "He rebukes the sea and dries it up, and he makes all the rivers run dry.

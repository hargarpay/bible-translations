", "2": "Joshua said to all the people, \u201cThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Long ago your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods. ", "3": "But I took your father Abraham from the region beyond the Euphrates River, led him throughout the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac, ", "4": "and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave the hill country of Seir to Esau as a possession. \u201c'Jacob and his sons, however, went down to Egypt. ", "5": "I sent Moses and Aaron, and I defeated Egypt by what I did within it, and afterward I brought you out. ", "6": "When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the Red Sea, the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen as far as the sea. ", "7": "Your fathers cried out to the Lord, so he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea over them, engulfing them. Your own eyes saw what I did to Egypt. After that, you lived in the wilderness a long time.", "8": "\u201c'Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against you, but I handed them over to you. You possessed their land, and I annihilated them before you. ", "9": "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you, ", "10": "but I would not listen to Balaam. Instead, he repeatedly blessed you, and I rescued you from him.", "11": "\u201c'You then crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. Jericho's citizens\u2014as well as the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hethites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites\u2014fought against you, but I handed them over to you. ", "12": "I sent hornets[a] ahead of you, and they drove out the two Amorite kings before you. It was not by your sword or bow. ", "13": "I gave you a land you did not labor for, and cities you did not build, though you live in them; you are eating from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.'", "14": "\u201cTherefore, fear the Lord and worship him in sincerity and truth. Get rid of the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and worship the Lord. ", "15": "But if it doesn't please you to worship the Lord, choose for yourselves today: Which will you worship\u2014the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the Euphrates River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living? As for me and my family, we will worship the Lord.\u201d", "16": "The people replied, \u201cWe will certainly not abandon the Lord to worship other gods! ", "17": "For the Lord our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also protected us all along the way we went and among all the peoples whose lands we traveled through.

We too will worship the Lord, because he is our God.\u201d", "19": "But Joshua told the people, \u201cYou will not be able to worship the Lord, because he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions and sins.

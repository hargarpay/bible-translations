{"1": "This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. ", "2": "At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was imprisoned in the guard's courtyard in the palace of the king of Judah. ", "3": "King Zedekiah of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, \u201cWhy are you prophesying as you do? You say, 'This is what the Lord says: Look, I am about to hand this city over to Babylon's king, and he will capture it. ", "4": "King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; indeed, he will certainly be handed over to Babylon's king. They will speak face to face[a] and meet eye to eye. ", "5": "He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him\u2014this is the Lord's declaration. For you will fight the Chaldeans, but you will not succeed.'\u201d", "6": "Jeremiah replied, \u201cThe word of the Lord came to me: ", "7": "Watch! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, 'Buy my field in Anathoth for yourself, for you own the right of redemption to buy it.'", "8": "\u201cThen, as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to the guard's courtyard and urged me, 'Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord. ", "9": "So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the silver to him\u2014seventeen shekels[b] of silver. ", "10": "I recorded it on a scroll, sealed it, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales. ", "11": "I took the purchase agreement\u2014the sealed copy with its terms and conditions and the open copy\u2014", "12": "and gave the purchase agreement to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah.

You yourself made the heavens and earth by your great power and with your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you!

", "21": "You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror. ", "22": "You gave them this land you swore to give to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. ", "23": "They entered and possessed it, but they did not obey you or live according to your instructions. They failed to perform all you commanded them to do, and so you have brought all this disaster on them. ", "24": "Look! Siege ramps have come against the city to capture it, and the city, as a result of the sword, famine, and plague, has been handed over to the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you have spoken has happened. Look, you can see it!

Is anything too difficult for me? ", "28": "Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans, to Babylon's king Nebuchadnezzar, and he will capture it.

They have done nothing but anger me by the work of their hands\u201d\u2014this is the Lord's declaration\u2014", "31": "\u201cfor this city has caused my wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. I will therefore remove it from my presence ", "32": "because of all the evil the Israelites and Judeans have done to anger me\u2014they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem.

", "35": "They have built the high places of Baal in Ben Hinnom Valley to sacrifice their sons and daughters in the fire[f] to Molech\u2014something I had not commanded them. I had never entertained the thought[g] that they do this detestable act causing Judah to sin!", "36": "\u201cNow therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to this city about which you said, 'It has been handed over to Babylon's king through sword, famine, and plague': ", "37": "I will certainly gather them from all the lands where I have banished them in my anger, rage and intense wrath, and I will return them to this place and make them live in safety.

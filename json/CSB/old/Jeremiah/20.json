{"1": "Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer and chief official in the temple of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. ", "2": "So Pashhur had the prophet Jeremiah beaten and put him in the stocks at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the Lord's temple. ", "3": "The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, \u201cThe Lord does not call you Pashhur, but Terror Is on Every Side,[a] ", "4": "for this is what the Lord says, 'I am about to make you a terror to both yourself and those you love. They will fall by the sword of their enemies before your very eyes. I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will deport them to Babylon and put them to the sword. ", "5": "I will give away all the wealth of this city, all its products and valuables. Indeed, I will hand all the treasures of the kings of Judah over to their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon. ", "6": "As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon. There you will die, and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you prophesied lies.'\u201d", "7": "You deceived me, Lord, and I was deceived. You seized me and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the time; everyone ridicules me.", "8": "For whenever I speak, I cry out, I proclaim, \u201cViolence and destruction!\u201d  so the word of the Lord has become my constant disgrace and derision.", "9": "I say, \u201cI won't mention him or speak any longer in his name.\u201d But his message becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones. I become tired of holding it in, and I cannot prevail.", "10": "For I have heard the gossip of many people, \u201cTerror is on every side! Report him; let's report him!\u201d Everyone I trusted[b] watches for my fall. \u201cPerhaps he will be deceived so that we might prevail against him and take our vengeance on him.\u201d", "11": "But the Lord is with me like a violent warrior. Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. Since they have not succeeded, they will be utterly shamed, an everlasting humiliation that will never be forgotten.", "12": "Lord of Armies, testing the righteous and seeing the heart[c] and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to you.", "13": "Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord, for he rescues the life of the needy from evil people.", "14": "May the day I was born be cursed. May the day my mother bore me never be blessed.", "15": "May the man be cursed who brought the news to my father, saying, \u201cA male child is born to you,\u201d bringing him great joy.", "16": "Let that man be like the cities the Lord demolished without compassion. Let him hear an outcry in the morning and a war cry at noontime", "17": "because he didn't kill me in the womb so that my mother might have been my grave, her womb eternally pregnant.", "18": "Why did I come out of the womb to see only struggle and sorrow, to end my life in shame?"}

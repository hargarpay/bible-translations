This is the Lord's declaration.", "12": "They have contradicted the Lord and insisted, \u201cIt won't happen.[e] Harm won't come to us; we won't see sword or famine.\u201d", "13": "The prophets become only wind, for the Lord's word is not in them. This will in fact happen to them.", "14": "Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Armies says: Because you have spoken this word, I am going to make my words become fire in your mouth. These people are the wood, and the fire will consume them.", "15": "I am about to bring a nation from far away against you, house of Israel. This is the Lord's declaration.

They will consume your sons and your daughters. They will consume your flocks and your herds. They will consume your vines and your fig trees. With the sword they will destroy your fortified cities in which you trust.", "18": "\u201cBut even in those days\u201d\u2014this is the Lord's declaration\u2014\u201cI will not finish you off.

They have not taken up cases, such as the case of the fatherless, so they might prosper, and they have not defended the rights of the needy.", "29": "Should I not punish them for these things? This is the Lord's declaration. Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?", "30": "An appalling, horrible thing has taken place in the land.", "31": "The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority. My people love it like this. But what will you do at the end of it?"}

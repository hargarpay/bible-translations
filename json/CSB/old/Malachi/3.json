Then the Lord you seek will suddenly come to his temple, the Messenger of the covenant you delight in\u2014see, he is coming,\u201d says the Lord of Armies. ", "2": "But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will be able to stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire and like launderer's bleach.[a] ", "3": "He will be like a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the Lord in righteousness.

Yet you are robbing me!\u201d \u201cHow do we rob you?\u201d you ask. \u201cBy not making the payments of the tenth and the contributions.

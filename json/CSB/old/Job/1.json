{"1": "There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of complete integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil. ", "2": "He had seven sons and three daughters. ", "3": "His estate included seven thousand sheep and goats, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east.", "4": "His sons used to take turns having banquets at their homes. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them. ", "5": "Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send for his children and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for[a] all of them. For Job thought, \u201cPerhaps my children have sinned, having cursed God in their hearts.\u201d This was Job's regular practice.", "6": "One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[b] also came with them. ", "7": "The Lord asked Satan, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d \u201cFrom roaming through the earth,\u201d Satan answered him, \u201cand walking around on it.\u201d", "8": "Then the Lord said to Satan, \u201cHave you considered my servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil.\u201d", "9": "Satan answered the Lord, \u201cDoes Job fear God for nothing? ", "10": "Haven't you placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. ", "11": "But stretch out your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse you to your face.\u201d", "12": "\u201cVery well,\u201d the Lord told Satan, \u201ceverything he owns is in your power. However, do not lay a hand on Job himself.\u201d So Satan left the Lord's presence.", "13": "One day when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, ", "14": "a messenger came to Job and reported: \u201cWhile the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby, ", "15": "the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d", "16": "He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: \u201cGod's fire fell from heaven. It burned the sheep and the servants and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d", "17": "That messenger was still speaking when yet another came and reported: \u201cThe Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d", "18": "He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: \u201cYour sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house. ", "19": "Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!\u201d", "20": "Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped, ", "21": "saying: Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will leave this life.[c] The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.", "22": "Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything.[d]"}

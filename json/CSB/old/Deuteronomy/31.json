", "3": "The Lord your God is the one who will cross ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will drive them out. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, as the Lord has said. ", "4": "The Lord will deal with them as he did Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land when he destroyed them.

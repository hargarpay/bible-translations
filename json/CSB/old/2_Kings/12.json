", "2": "Throughout the time the priest Jehoiada instructed him, Joash did what was right in the Lord's sight. ", "3": "Yet the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.", "4": "Then Joash said to the priests, \u201cAll the dedicated silver brought to the Lord's temple, census silver, silver from vows, and all silver voluntarily given for the Lord's temple\u2014", "5": "each priest is to take it from his assessor[a] and repair whatever damage is found in the temple.\u201d[b]", "6": "But by the twenty-third year of the reign of King Joash, the priests had not repaired the damage[c] to the temple. ", "7": "So King Joash called the priest Jehoiada and the other priests and asked, \u201cWhy haven't you repaired the temple's damage? Since you haven't, don't take any silver from your assessors; instead, hand it over for the repair of the temple.\u201d ", "8": "So the priests agreed that they would receive no silver from the people and would not be the ones to repair the temple's damage.", "9": "Then the priest Jehoiada took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the Lord's temple; the priests who guarded the threshold put into the chest all the silver that was brought to the Lord's temple. ", "10": "Whenever they saw there was a large amount of silver in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would go bag up and tally the silver found in the Lord's temple.

Many false prophets have already gone out into the world, ", "2": "and you can know which ones come from God. His Spirit says that Jesus Christ had a truly human body. ", "3": "But when someone doesn't say this about Jesus, you know that person has a spirit that doesn't come from God and is the enemy of Christ. You knew that this enemy was coming into the world and now is already here.", "4": "Children, you belong to God, and you have defeated these enemies. God's Spirit[a] is in you and is more powerful than the one that is in the world. ", "5": "These enemies belong to this world, and the world listens to them, because they speak its language. ", "6": "We belong to God, and everyone who knows God will listen to us. But the people who don't know God won't listen to us. That is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies.", "7": "My dear friends, we must love each other. Love comes from God, and when we love each other, it shows that we have been given new life. We are now God's children, and we know him.

", "17": "If we truly love others and live as Christ did in this world, we won't be worried about the day of judgment. ", "18": "A real love for others will chase those worries away. The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid. It shows that we have not really learned to love.", "19": "We love because God loved us first.

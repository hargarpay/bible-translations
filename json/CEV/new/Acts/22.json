In fact, I was just as eager to obey God as any of you are today.", "4": "I made trouble for everyone who followed the Lord's Way,[a] and I even had some of them killed. I had others arrested and put in jail. I didn't care if they were men or women. ", "5": "The high priest and all the council members can tell you that this is true. They even gave me letters to the Jewish leaders in Damascus, so that I could arrest people there and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.", "6": "One day about noon I was getting close to Damascus, when a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me. ", "7": "I fell to the ground and heard a voice asking, \u201cSaul, Saul, why are you so cruel to me?\u201d", "8": "\u201cWho are you?\u201d I answered.

The people won't listen to what you say about me.\u201d", "19": "I replied, \u201cLord, they know that in many of our meeting places I arrested and beat people who had faith in you. ", "20": "Stephen was killed because he spoke for you, and I stood there and cheered them on. I even guarded the clothes of the men who murdered him.\u201d", "21": "But the Lord told me to go, and he promised to send me far away to the Gentiles.", "22": "The crowd listened until Paul said this.

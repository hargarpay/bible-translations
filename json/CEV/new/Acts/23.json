", "14": "Then some of them went to the chief priests and the nation's leaders and said, \u201cWe have promised God that we would not eat a thing until we have killed Paul. ", "15": "You and everyone in the council must go to the commander and pretend that you want to find out more about the charges against Paul. Ask for him to be brought before your court.

But when I found out that he was a Roman citizen, I took some soldiers and rescued him.", "28": "I wanted to find out what they had against him. So I brought him before their council ", "29": "and learned that the charges concern only their religious laws. This man isn't guilty of anything for which he should die or even be put in jail.", "30": "As soon as I learned that there was a plot against him, I sent him to you and told their leaders to bring charges against him in your court.", "31": "The soldiers obeyed the commander's orders, and that same night they took Paul to the city of Antipatris.

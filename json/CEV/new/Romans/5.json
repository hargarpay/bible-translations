", "2": "Christ has also introduced us[b] to God's undeserved kindness on which we take our stand. So we are happy, as we look forward to sharing in the glory of God. ", "3": "But that's not all! We gladly suffer,[c] because we know that suffering helps us to endure. ", "4": "And endurance builds character, which gives us a hope ", "5": "that will never disappoint us. All of this happens because God has given us the Holy Spirit, who fills our hearts with his love.", "6": "Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful. ", "7": "No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person. ", "8": "But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.", "9": "But there is more! Now that God has accepted us because Christ sacrificed his life's blood, we will also be kept safe from God's anger. ", "10": "Even when we were God's enemies, he made peace with us, because his Son died for us. Yet something even greater than friendship is ours.

", "14": "Yet death still had power over all who lived from the time of Adam to the time of Moses. This happened, though not everyone disobeyed a direct command from God, as Adam did. In some ways Adam is like Christ who came later. ", "15": "But the gift that God was kind enough to give was very different from Adam's sin. That one sin brought death to many others. Yet in an even greater way, Jesus Christ alone brought God's gift of kindness to many people.", "16": "There is a lot of difference between Adam's sin and God's gift. That one sin led to punishment. But God's gift made it possible for us to be acceptable to him, even though we have sinned many times. ", "17": "Death ruled like a king because Adam had sinned. But that cannot compare with what Jesus Christ has done. God has been so kind to us, and he has accepted us because of Jesus. And so we will live and rule like kings.", "18": "Everyone was going to be punished because Adam sinned. But because of the good thing that Christ has done, God accepts us and gives us the gift of life. ", "19": "Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners. But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God.", "20": "The Law came, so that the full power of sin could be seen. Yet where sin was powerful, God's kindness was even more powerful. ", "21": "Sin ruled by means of death. But God's kindness now rules, and God has accepted us because of Jesus Christ our Lord. This means that we will have eternal life."}

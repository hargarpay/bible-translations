We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God. ", "2": "And we shouldn't need to keep teaching about baptisms[a] or about the laying on of hands[b] or about people being raised from death and the future judgment. ", "3": "Let's grow up, if God is willing.", "4-6": "But what about people who turn away after they have already seen the light and have received the gift from heaven and have shared in the Holy Spirit? What about those who turn away after they have received the good message of God and the powers of the future world? There is no way to bring them back. What they are doing is the same as nailing the Son of God to a cross and insulting him in public!", "7": "A field is useful to farmers, if there is enough rain to make good crops grow. In fact, God will bless that field. ", "8": "But land that produces only thornbushes is worthless.

And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed. We have run to God for safety.

In fact, hope reaches behind the curtain[c] and into the most holy place. ", "20": "Jesus has gone there ahead of us, and he is our high priest forever, just like Melchizedek.[d]"}

But why did Christ mention these things and say that God did not want them? ", "9": "Well, it was to do away with offerings and sacrifices and to replace them. That is what he meant by saying to God, \u201cI have come to do what you want.\u201d ", "10": "So we are made holy because Christ obeyed God and offered himself once for all.", "11": "The priests do their work each day, and they keep on offering sacrifices that can never take away sins.

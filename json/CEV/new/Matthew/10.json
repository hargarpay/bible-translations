", "6": "Go only to the people of Israel, because they are like a flock of lost sheep. ", "7": "As you go, announce that the kingdom of heaven will soon be here.[d] ", "8": "Heal the sick, raise the dead to life, heal people who have leprosy,[e] and force out demons. You received without paying, now give without being paid. ", "9": "Don't take along any gold, silver, or copper coins. ", "10": "And don't carry[f] a traveling bag or an extra shirt or sandals or a walking stick. Workers deserve their food.

", "20": "But you will not really be the one speaking. The Spirit from your Father will tell you what to say.", "21": "Brothers and sisters will betray one another and have each other put to death.

I promise you that before you have gone to all the towns of Israel, the Son of Man will come.", "24": "Disciples are not better than their teacher, and slaves are not better than their master. ", "25": "It is enough for disciples to be like their teacher and for slaves to be like their master.

", "38": "And unless you are willing to take up your cross and come with me, you are not fit to be my disciples. ", "39": "If you try to save your life, you will lose it. But if you give it up for me, you will surely find it.", "40": "Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me also welcomes the one who sent me.

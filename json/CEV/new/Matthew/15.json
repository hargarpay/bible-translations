{"1": "About this time some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem. They asked Jesus, ", "2": "\u201cWhy don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do? They don't even wash their hands[a] before they eat.\u201d", "3": "Jesus answered: Why do you disobey God and follow your own teaching? ", "4": "Didn't God command you to respect your father and mother? Didn't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents? ", "5": "But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should. You let them say that what they have has been offered to God.[b] ", "6": "Is this any way to show respect to your parents? You ignore God's commands in order to follow your own teaching. ", "7": "And you are nothing but show-offs! Isaiah the prophet was right when he wrote that God had said,", "8": "\u201cAll of you praise me with your words, but you never really think about me.", "9": "It is useless for you to worship me, when you teach rules made up by humans.\u201d", "10": "Jesus called the crowd together and said, \u201cPay attention and try to understand what I mean. ", "11": "The food that you put into your mouth doesn't make you unclean and unfit to worship God. The bad words that come out of your mouth are what make you unclean.\u201d", "12": "Then his disciples came over to him and asked, \u201cDo you know that you insulted the Pharisees by what you said?\u201d", "13": "Jesus answered, \u201cEvery plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots. ", "14": "Stay away from those Pharisees! They are like blind people leading other blind people, and all of them will fall into a ditch.\u201d", "15": "Peter replied, \u201cWhat did you mean when you talked about the things that make people unclean?\u201d", "16": "Jesus then said: Don't any of you know what I am talking about by now? ", "17": "Don't you know that the food you put into your mouth goes into your stomach and then out of your body? ", "18": "But the words that come out of your mouth come from your heart. And they are what make you unfit to worship God. ", "19": "Out of your heart come evil thoughts, murder, unfaithfulness in marriage, vulgar deeds, stealing, telling lies, and insulting others.

They placed them, and many others, in front of Jesus, and he healed them all. ", "31": "Everyone was amazed at what they saw and heard. People who had never spoken could now speak. The lame were healed, the crippled could walk, and the blind were able to see. Everyone was praising the God of Israel.", "32": "Jesus called his disciples together and told them, \u201cI feel sorry for these people.

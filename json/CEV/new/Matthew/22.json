My cattle and prize calves have all been prepared. Everything is ready. Come to the banquet!\u201d", "5": "But the guests did not pay any attention. Some of them left for their farms, and some went to their places of business. ", "6": "Others grabbed the servants, then beat them up and killed them.", "7": "This made the king so furious that he sent an army to kill those murderers and burn down their city. ", "8": "Then he said to the servants, \u201cIt is time for the wedding banquet, and the invited guests don't deserve to come.

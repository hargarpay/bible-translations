", "4": "But if you are as humble as this child, you are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ", "5": "And when you welcome one of these children because of me, you welcome me.", "6": "It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the deepest part of the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks! ", "7": "The world is in for trouble because of the way it causes people to sin. There will always be something to cause people to sin, but anyone who does this will be in for trouble.", "8": "If your hand or foot causes you to sin, chop it off and throw it away! You would be better off to go into life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the fire that never goes out. ", "9": "If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and get rid of it. You would be better off to go into life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fires of hell.", "10-11": "Don't be cruel to any of these little ones!

He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost.", "15": "If one of my followers[b] sins against you, go and point out what was wrong. But do it in private, just between the two of you. If that person listens, you have won back a follower. ", "16": "But if that one refuses to listen, take along one or two others. The Scriptures teach that every complaint must be proven true by two or more witnesses. ", "17": "If the follower refuses to listen to them, report the matter to the church. Anyone who refuses to listen to the church must be treated like an unbeliever or a tax collector.[c]", "18": "I promise you that God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth, but he will not allow anything you don't allow.

He started choking him and said, \u201cPay me what you owe!\u201d", "29": "The man got down on his knees and began begging, \u201cHave pity on me, and I will pay you back.\u201d ", "30": "But the first official refused to have pity. Instead, he went and had the other official put in jail until he could pay what he owed.", "31": "When some other officials found out what had happened, they felt sorry for the man who had been put in jail. Then they told the king what had happened. ", "32": "The king called the first official back in and said, \u201cYou're an evil man! When you begged for mercy, I said you did not have to pay back a cent.

", "35": "That is how my Father in heaven will treat you, if you don't forgive each of my followers with all your heart."}

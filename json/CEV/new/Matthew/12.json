{"1": "One Sabbath, Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields.[a] His disciples were hungry and began picking and eating grains of wheat.

", "4": "He went into the house of God, and then they ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are supposed to eat. ", "5": "Haven't you read in the Law of Moses that the priests are allowed to work in the temple on the Sabbath? But no one says that they are guilty of breaking the law of the Sabbath. ", "6": "I tell you that there is something here greater than the temple. ", "7": "Don't you know what the Scriptures mean when they say, \u201cInstead of offering sacrifices to me, I want you to be merciful to others?\u201d If you knew what this means, you would not condemn these innocent disciples of mine.

", "12": "People are worth much more than sheep, and so it is right to do good on the Sabbath.\u201d ", "13": "Then Jesus told the man, \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man did, and it became as healthy as the other one.", "14": "The Pharisees left and started making plans to kill Jesus.", "15": "When Jesus found out what was happening, he left there and large crowds followed him. He healed all of their sick, ", "16": "but warned them not to tell anyone about him.

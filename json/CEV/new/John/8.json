They made her stand in the middle of the crowd. ", "4": "Then they said, \u201cTeacher, this woman was caught sleeping with a man who isn't her husband. ", "5": "The Law of Moses teaches that a woman like this should be stoned to death! What do you say?\u201d", "6": "They asked Jesus this question, because they wanted to test him and bring some charge against him. But Jesus simply bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger.", "7": "They kept on asking Jesus about the woman. Finally, he stood up and said, \u201cIf any of you have never sinned, then go ahead and throw the first stone at her!\u201d ", "8": "Once again he bent over and began writing on the ground.

I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don't know where I am from or where I am going. ", "15": "You judge in the same way that everyone else does, but I don't judge anyone.

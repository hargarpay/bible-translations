But everyone who doesn't have faith in him has already been condemned for not having faith in God's only Son.", "19": "The light has come into the world, and people who do evil things are judged guilty because they love the dark more than the light. ", "20": "People who do evil hate the light and won't come to the light, because it clearly shows what they have done.

", "5": "Jesus shouted, \u201cFriends, have you caught anything?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d they answered.", "6": "So he told them, \u201cLet your net down on the right side of your boat, and you will catch some fish.\u201d They did, and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat.", "7": "Jesus' favorite disciple told Peter, \u201cIt's the Lord!\u201d When Simon heard that it was the Lord, he put on the clothes that he had taken off while he was working.

In it were one hundred fifty-three large fish, but still the net did not rip.", "12": "Jesus said, \u201cCome and eat!\u201d But none of the disciples dared ask who he was. They knew he was the Lord.

He simply said, \u201cWhat is it to you, if I want him to live until I return?\u201d", "24": "This disciple is the one who told all of this. He wrote it, and we know he is telling the truth.", "25": "Jesus did many other things. If they were all written in books, I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books."}

", "2": "Every king on earth has slept with her, and her shameless ways are like wine that has made everyone on earth drunk.\u201d", "3": "With the help of the Spirit, the angel took me into the desert, where I saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The beast was covered with names that were an insult to God, and it had seven heads and ten horns. ", "4": "The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet robes, and she wore jewelry made of gold, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup filled with the filthy and nasty things she had done.

I will explain the mystery about this woman and about the beast she is sitting on, with its seven heads and ten horns. ", "8": "The beast you saw is one that used to be and no longer is.

", "4": "You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields, and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you. The Lord All-Powerful has surely heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops.", "5": "While here on earth, you have thought only of filling your own stomachs and having a good time. But now you are like fat cattle on their way to be butchered. ", "6": "You have condemned and murdered innocent people, who couldn't even fight back.", "7": "My friends, be patient until the Lord returns.

The Lord will heal them, and if they have sinned, he will forgive them.", "16": "If you have sinned, you should tell each other what you have done. Then you can pray for one another and be healed. The prayer of an innocent person is powerful, and it can help a lot. ", "17": "Elijah was just as human as we are, and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling.

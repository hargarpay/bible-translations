", "2": "This is because children are placed in the care of guardians and teachers until the time their parents have set. ", "3": "That is how it was with us. We were like children ruled by the powers of this world.", "4": "But when the time was right, God sent his Son, and a woman gave birth to him. His Son obeyed the Law, ", "5": "so he could set us free from the Law, and we could become God's children. ", "6": "Now that we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts. And his Spirit tells us that God is our Father. ", "7": "You are no longer slaves. You are God's children, and you will be given what he has promised.", "8": "Before you knew God, you were slaves of gods that are not real.

", "11": "I am afraid I have wasted my time working with you.", "12": "My friends, I beg you to be like me, just as I once tried to be like you. Did you mistreat me ", "13": "when I first preached to you? No you didn't, even though you knew I had come there because I was sick. ", "14": "My illness must have caused you some trouble, but you didn't hate me or turn me away because of it. You welcomed me as though I were one of God's angels or even Christ Jesus himself. ", "15": "Where is that good feeling now? I am sure that if it had been possible, you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me. ", "16": "Am I now your enemy, just because I told you the truth?", "17": "Those people may be paying you a lot of attention, but it isn't for your good. They only want to keep you away from me, so you will pay them a lot of attention. ", "18": "It is always good to give your attention to something worthwhile, even when I am not with you. ", "19": "My children, I am in terrible pain until Christ may be seen living in you. ", "20": "I wish I were with you now. Then I would not have to talk this way. You really have me puzzled.", "21": "Some of you would like to be under the rule of the Law of Moses. But do you know what the Law says?

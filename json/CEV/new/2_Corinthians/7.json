{"1": "My friends, God has made us these promises. So we should stay away from everything that keeps our bodies and spirits from being clean. We should honor God and try to be completely like him.", "2": "Make a place for us in your hearts! We haven't mistreated or hurt anyone. We haven't cheated anyone. ", "3": "I am not saying this to be hard on you. But, as I have said before, you will always be in our thoughts, whether we live or die. ", "4": "I trust you completely.[a] I am always proud of you, and I am greatly encouraged. In all my trouble I am still very happy.", "5": "After we came to Macedonia, we didn't have any chance to rest. We were faced with all kinds of problems. We were troubled by enemies and troubled by fears. ", "6": "But God cheers up people in need, and that is what he did when he sent Titus to us. ", "7": "Of course, we were glad to see Titus, but what really made us glad is the way you cheered him up. He told how sorry you were and how concerned you were about me. And this made me even happier.", "8": "I don't feel bad anymore, even though my letter[b] hurt your feelings. I did feel bad at first, but I don't now. I know that the letter hurt you for a while.

But when this world makes you feel sorry, it can cause your death.", "11": "Just look what God has done by making you feel sorry! You sincerely want to prove that you are innocent. You are angry. You are shocked. You are eager to see that justice is done. You have proved that you were completely right in this matter. ", "12": "When I wrote you, it wasn't to accuse the one who was wrong or to take up for the one who was hurt. I wrote, so that God would show you how much you do care for us.

", "14": "We had told him how much we thought of you, and you did not disappoint us. Just as we have always told you the truth, so everything we told him about you has also proved to be true. ", "15": "Titus loves all of you very much, especially when he remembers how you obeyed him and how you trembled with fear when you welcomed him. ", "16": "It makes me really glad to know that I can depend on you."}

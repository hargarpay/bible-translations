To God's church in Corinth and to all of God's people in Achaia.", "2": "I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!", "3": "Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! The Father is a merciful God, who always gives us comfort. ", "4": "He comforts us when we are in trouble, so that we can share that same comfort with others in trouble. ", "5": "We share in the terrible sufferings of Christ, but also in the wonderful comfort he gives. ", "6": "We suffer in the hope that you will be comforted and saved. And because we are comforted, you will also be comforted, as you patiently endure suffering like ours. ", "7": "You never disappoint us. You suffered as much as we did, and we know that you will be comforted as we were.", "8": "My friends, I want you to know what a hard time we had in Asia. Our sufferings were so horrible and so unbearable that death seemed certain. ", "9": "In fact, we felt sure that we were going to die.

", "10": "God saved us from the threat of death,[a] and we are sure that he will do it again and again. ", "11": "Please help us by praying for us.

", "18": "God can be trusted, and so can I, when I say that our answer to you has always been \u201cYes\u201d and never \u201cNo.\u201d ", "19": "This is because Jesus Christ the Son of God is always \u201cYes\u201d and never \u201cNo.\u201d And he is the one that Silas,[b] Timothy, and I told you about.", "20": "Christ says \u201cYes\u201d to all of God's promises. That's why we have Christ to say \u201cAmen\u201d[c] for us to the glory of God. ", "21": "And so God makes it possible for you and us to stand firmly together with Christ.

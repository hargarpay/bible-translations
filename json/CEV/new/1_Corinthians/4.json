", "4": "I don't know of anything against me, but that doesn't prove that I am right. The Lord is my judge. ", "5": "So don't judge anyone until the Lord returns. He will show what is hidden in the dark and what is in everyone's heart. Then God will be the one who praises each of us.", "6": "Friends, I have used Apollos and myself as examples to teach you the meaning of the saying, \u201cFollow the rules.\u201d I want you to stop saying that one of us is better than the other.

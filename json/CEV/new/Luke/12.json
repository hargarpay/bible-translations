It is their way of fooling people. ", "2": "Everything that is hidden will be found out, and every secret will be known. ", "3": "Whatever you say in the dark will be heard when it is day. Whatever you whisper in a closed room will be shouted from the housetops.", "4": "My friends, don't be afraid of people. They can kill you, but after that, there is nothing else they can do. ", "5": "God is the one you must fear. Not only can he take your life, but he can throw you into hell. God is certainly the one you should fear!", "6": "Five sparrows are sold for just two pennies, but God doesn't forget a one of them. ", "7": "Even the hairs on your head are counted. So don't be afraid! You are worth much more than many sparrows.", "8": "If you tell others that you belong to me, the Son of Man will tell God's angels that you are my followers.

You have such little faith!", "29": "Don't keep worrying about having something to eat or drink. ", "30": "Only people who don't know God are always worrying about such things. Your Father knows what you need. ", "31": "But put God's work first, and these things will be yours as well.", "32": "My little group of disciples, don't be afraid! Your Father wants to give you the kingdom. ", "33": "Sell what you have and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves moneybags that never wear out.

That servant will then be punished and thrown out with the servants who cannot be trusted.", "47": "If servants are not ready or willing to do what their master wants them to do, they will be beaten hard. ", "48": "But servants who don't know what their master wants them to do will not be beaten so hard for doing wrong. If God has been generous with you, he will expect you to serve him well.

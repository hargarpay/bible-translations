", "5": "The women were afraid and bowed to the ground. But the men said, \u201cWhy are you looking in the place of the dead for someone who is alive? ", "6": "Jesus isn't here! He has been raised from death. Remember that while he was still in Galilee, he told you, ", "7": "'The Son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will nail him to a cross.

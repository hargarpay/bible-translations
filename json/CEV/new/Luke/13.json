", "2": "Jesus replied: Do you think that these people were worse sinners than everyone else in Galilee just because of what happened to them? ", "3": "Not at all! But you can be sure that if you don't turn back to God, every one of you will also be killed. ", "4": "What about those eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were worse than everyone else in Jerusalem? ", "5": "Not at all! But you can be sure that if you don't turn back to God, every one of you will also die.", "6": "Jesus then told them this story: A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. One day he went out to pick some figs, but he didn't find any. ", "7": "So he said to the gardener, \u201cFor three years I have come looking for figs on this tree, and I haven't found any yet. Chop it down! Why should it take up space?\u201d", "8": "The gardener answered, \u201cMaster, leave it for another year. I'll dig around it and put some manure on it to make it grow. ", "9": "Maybe it will have figs on it next year. If it doesn't, you can have it cut down.\u201d", "10": "One Sabbath, Jesus was teaching in a Jewish meeting place, ", "11": "and a woman was there who had been crippled by an evil spirit for eighteen years.

Come and be healed on one of those days, but not on the Sabbath.\u201d", "15": "The Lord replied, \u201cAre you trying to fool someone? Won't any one of you untie your ox or donkey and lead it out to drink on a Sabbath? ", "16": "This woman belongs to the family of Abraham, but Satan has kept her bound for eighteen years. Isn't it right to set her free on the Sabbath?\u201d ", "17": "Jesus' words made his enemies ashamed. But everyone else in the crowd was happy about the wonderful things he was doing.", "18": "Jesus said, \u201cWhat is God's kingdom like? What can I compare it with?

The seed grows as big as a tree, and birds nest in its branches.\u201d", "20": "Then Jesus said, \u201cWhat can I compare God's kingdom with? ", "21": "It is like what happens when a woman mixes yeast into three batches of flour. Finally, all the dough rises.\u201d", "22": "As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he taught the people in the towns and villages. ", "23": "Someone asked him, \u201cLord, are only a few people going to be saved?\u201d Jesus answered:", "24": "Do all you can to go in by the narrow door! A lot of people will try to get in, but will not be able to. ", "25": "Once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door, you will be left standing outside. You will knock on the door and say, \u201cSir, open the door for us!\u201d But the owner will answer, \u201cI don't know a thing about you!\u201d", "26": "Then you will start saying, \u201cWe dined with you, and you taught in our streets.\u201d", "27": "But he will say, \u201cI really don't know who you are! Get away from me, you evil people!\u201d", "28": "Then when you have been thrown outside, you will weep and grit your teeth because you will see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God's kingdom.

After all, Jerusalem is the place where prophets are killed.", "34": "Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Your people have killed the prophets and have stoned the messengers who were sent to you. I have often wanted to gather your people, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you wouldn't let me. ", "35": "Now your temple will be deserted.

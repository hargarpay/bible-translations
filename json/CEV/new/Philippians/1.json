", "6": "God is the one who began this good work in you, and I am certain that he won't stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns.", "7": "You have a special place in my heart. So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do. All of you have helped in the work that God has given me, as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail.

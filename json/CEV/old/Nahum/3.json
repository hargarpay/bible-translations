I will pull up your skirt and let nations and kingdoms stare at your nakedness.", "6": "I will cover you with garbage, treat you like trash, and rub you in the dirt.", "7": "Everyone who sees you will turn away and shout, \u201cNineveh is done for! Is anyone willing to mourn or to give her comfort?\u201d", "8": "Nineveh, do you feel safer than the city of Thebes?[a] The Nile River was its wall of defense.[b]", "9": "Thebes trusted the mighty power of Ethiopia[c] and Egypt; the nations of Put[d] and Libya were her allies.", "10": "But she was captured and taken to a foreign country.

On a chilly day they settle on a fence, but when the sun comes out, they take off to who-knows-where.", "18": "King of Assyria, your officials and leaders sleep the eternal sleep, while your people are scattered in the mountains.

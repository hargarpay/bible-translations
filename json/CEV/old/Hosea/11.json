But they would not admit that I was the one who had healed them.", "4": "I led them with kindness and with love, not with ropes. I held them close to me;[b] I bent down to feed them.", "5": "But they trusted Egypt instead of returning to me; now Assyria will rule them.", "6": "War will visit their cities, and their plans will fail.[c]", "7": "My people are determined to reject me for a god they think is stronger, but he can't help.[d]", "8": "Israel, I can't let you go. I can't give you up. How could I possibly destroy you as I did the towns of Admah and Zeboiim?[e] I just can't do it.

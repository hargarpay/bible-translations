But[b] at Mizpah and Mount Tabor you trapped the people.", "2": "At the place of worship you were a treacherous pit,[c] and I will punish you.", "3": "Israel, I know all about you, and because of your unfaithfulness, I find you unacceptable.", "4": "Your evil deeds are the reason you won't return to me, your Lord God. And your constant craving for sex keeps you from knowing me.", "5": "Israel, your pride testifies to your guilt; it makes you stumble, and Judah stumbles too.", "6": "You offer sheep and cattle as sacrifices to me, but I have turned away and refuse to be found.", "7": "You have been unfaithful to me, your Lord; you have had children by prostitutes.[d] So at the New Moon Festival, you and your crops will be destroyed.[e]", "8": "Give a warning on the trumpet! Let it be heard in Gibeah, Ramah, and sinful Bethel.[f] Benjamin, watch out![g]", "9": "I, the Lord, will punish and wipe out Israel.

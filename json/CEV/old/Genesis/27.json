Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the Lord as his witness. ", "8": "Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do. ", "9": "Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much.

The first time he cheated me out of my rights as the first-born son, and now he has cheated me out of my blessing.\u201d Then Esau asked his father, \u201cDon't you still have any blessing left for me?\u201d", "37": "\u201cMy son,\u201d Isaac answered, \u201cI have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers, and all of you will be his servants.

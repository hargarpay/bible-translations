", "7": "But Er was very evil, and the Lord took his life. ", "8": "So Judah told Onan, \u201cIt's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother.\u201d[a]", "9": "Onan knew the child would not be his,[b] and when he had sex with Tamar, he made sure that she would not get pregnant.

But before either of them was born, one of them stuck a hand out of her womb. The woman who was helping tied a red thread around the baby's hand and explained, \u201cThis one came out first.\u201d", "29": "Right away his hand went back in, and the other child was born first. The woman then said, \u201cWhat an opening you've made for yourself!\u201d So they named the baby Perez.[d] ", "30": "When the brother with the red thread came out, they named him Zerah.[e]"}

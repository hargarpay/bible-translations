You have done a terrible thing.'\u201d", "6": "When the servant caught up with them, he said exactly what Joseph had told him to say. ", "7": "But they replied, \u201cSir, why do you say such things? We would never do anything like that! ", "8": "We even returned the money we found in our grain sacks when we got back to Canaan.

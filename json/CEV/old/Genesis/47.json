They have brought their sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else they own to the region of Goshen.\u201d Then he introduced his brothers to the king, ", "3": "who asked them, \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d \u201cSir, we are shepherds,\u201d was their answer. \u201cOur families have always raised sheep. ", "4": "But in our country all the pastures are dried up, and our sheep have no grass to eat. So we, your servants, have come here. Please let us live in the region of Goshen.\u201d", "5": "The king said to Joseph, \u201cIt's good that your father and brothers have arrived. ", "6": "I will let them live anywhere they choose in the land of Egypt, but I suggest that they settle in Goshen, the best part of our land. I would also like for your finest shepherds to watch after my own sheep and goats.\u201d", "7": "Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and introduced him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing, ", "8": "and the king asked him, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d", "9": "Jacob answered, \u201cI have lived only a hundred thirty years, and I have had to move from place to place. My parents and my grandparents also had to move from place to place. But they lived much longer, and their life was not as hard as mine.\u201d ", "10": "Then Jacob gave the king his blessing once again and left.

If you don't, we'll soon be dead, because our money's all gone.\u201d", "16": "\u201cIf you don't have any money,\u201d Joseph answered, \u201cgive me your animals, and I'll let you have some grain.\u201d ", "17": "From then on, they brought him their horses and donkeys and their sheep and goats in exchange for grain. Within a year Joseph had collected every animal in Egypt. ", "18": "Then the people came to him and said: Sir, there's no way we can hide the truth from you. We are broke, and we don't have any more animals. We have nothing left except ourselves and our land. ", "19": "Don't let us starve and our land be ruined. If you'll give us grain to eat and seed to plant, we'll sell ourselves and our land to the king.[b] We'll become his slaves.", "20": "The famine became so severe that Joseph finally bought every piece of land in Egypt for the king ", "21": "and made everyone the king's slaves,[c] ", "22": "except the priests.

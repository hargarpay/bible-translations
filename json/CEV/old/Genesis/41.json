So he called in his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.", "9": "The king's personal servant said: Now I remember what I was supposed to do.

I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt. ", "20": "The skinny cows ate the fat ones.

They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert. ", "24": "These heads of grain swallowed the full ones.

", "35": "Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities.

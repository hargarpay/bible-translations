", "8": "He then served his guests some yogurt and milk together with the meat. While they were eating, he stood near them under the trees, ", "9": "and they asked, \u201cWhere is your wife Sarah?\u201d \u201cShe is right there in the tent,\u201d Abraham answered.", "10": "One of the guests was the Lord, and he said, \u201cI'll come back about this time next year, and when I do, Sarah will already have a son.\u201d Sarah was behind Abraham, listening at the entrance to the tent.

But the Lord stayed with Abraham, ", "23": "who asked, \u201cLord, when you destroy the evil people, are you also going to destroy those who are good? ", "24": "Wouldn't you spare the city if there are only fifty good people in it? ", "25": "You surely wouldn't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones. You are the judge of all the earth, and you do what is right.\u201d", "26": "The Lord replied, \u201cIf I find fifty good people in Sodom, I will save the city to keep them from being killed.\u201d", "27": "Abraham answered, \u201cI am nothing more than the dust of the earth. Please forgive me, Lord, for daring to speak to you like this. ", "28": "But suppose there are only forty-five good people in Sodom.

Suppose you find only ten good people there.\u201d \u201cFor the sake of ten good people,\u201d the Lord told him, \u201cI still won't destroy the city.\u201d", "33": "After speaking with Abraham, the Lord left, and Abraham went back home."}

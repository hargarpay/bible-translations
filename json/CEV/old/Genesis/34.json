", "4": "He even asked his father to get her for his wife.", "5": "Meanwhile, Jacob heard what had happened.

When they learned that their sister had been raped, they became furiously angry. Nothing is more disgraceful than rape, and it should not be tolerated in Israel.", "8": "Hamor said to Jacob and his sons: My son Shechem really loves Dinah. Please let him marry her. ", "9": "Why don't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours? ", "10": "You can share this land with us. Move freely about until you find the property you want; then buy it and settle down here.", "11": "Shechem added, \u201cDo this favor for me, and I'll give whatever you want.

Our men will have to be circumcised like their men. ", "23": "Just think! We'll get their property, as well as their flocks and herds.

", "8": "When your father said the speckled sheep would be my wages, all of them were speckled. And when he said the spotted ones would be mine, all of them were spotted. ", "9": "That's how God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me.", "10": "Once, when the flocks were mating, I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled. ", "11": "Then God's angel called me by name. I answered, ", "12": "and he said, \u201cNotice that all the rams are either spotted or speckled. I know everything Laban is doing to you, ", "13": "and I am the God you worshiped at Bethel,[a] when you poured olive oil on a rock and made a promise to me. Leave here right away and return to the land where you were born.\u201d", "14": "Rachel and Leah said to Jacob: There's nothing left for us to inherit from our father. ", "15": "He treats us like foreigners and has even cheated us out of the bride price[b] that should have been ours. ", "16": "Now do whatever God tells you to do. Even the property God took from our father and gave to you really belongs to us and our children.", "17": "Then Jacob, his wives, and his children got on camels and left ", "18": "for the home of his father Isaac in Canaan.

Laban went to Jacob ", "26": "and said: Look what you've done! You've tricked me and run off with my daughters like a kidnapper. ", "27": "Why did you sneak away without telling me? I would have given you a going-away party with singing and with music on tambourines and harps. ", "28": "You didn't even give me a chance to kiss my own grandchildren and daughters good-by. That was really foolish. ", "29": "I could easily hurt you, but the God your father worshiped has warned me not to make any threats or promises.", "30": "I can understand why you were eager to return to your father, but why did you have to steal my idols?", "31": "Jacob answered, \u201cI left secretly because I was afraid you would take your daughters from me by force.

Have I committed some crime? Is that why you hunted me down? ", "37": "After searching through everything I have, did you find anything of yours? If so, put it here, where your relatives and mine can see it. Then we can decide what to do.", "38": "In all the twenty years that I've worked for you, not one of your sheep or goats has had a miscarriage, and I've never eaten even one of your rams. ", "39": "If a wild animal killed one of your sheep or goats, I paid for it myself. In fact, you demanded the full price, whether the animal was killed during the day or at night.[g] ", "40": "I sweated every day, and I couldn't sleep at night because of the cold.", "41": "I had to work fourteen of these twenty long years to earn your two daughters and another six years to buy your sheep and goats.

But God saw my hard work, and he knew the trouble I was in, so he helped me. Then last night he told you how wrong you were.", "43": "Laban said to Jacob, \u201cLeah and Rachel are my daughters, and their children belong to me. All these sheep you are taking are really mine too. In fact, everything you have belongs to me. But there is nothing I can do to keep my daughters and their children.

", "49": "Laban also said, \u201cThis pile of rocks means that the Lord will watch us both while we are apart from each other.\u201d So the place was also named Mizpah.[k]", "50": "Then Laban said: If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women, I may not know about it, but remember, God is watching us! ", "51-52": "Both this pile of rocks and this large rock have been set up between us as a reminder. I must never go beyond them to attack you, and you must never go beyond them to attack me. ", "53": "My father Nahor, your grandfather Abraham, and their ancestors all worshiped the same God, and he will make sure that we each keep the agreement. Then Jacob made a promise in the name of the fearsome God[l] his father Isaac had worshiped.

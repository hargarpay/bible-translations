You have led me to his relatives and kept your promise to him.\u201d", "28": "Rebekah ran straight home and told her family everything. ", "29-30": "Her brother Laban heard her tell what the servant had said, and he saw the ring and the bracelets she was wearing. So Laban ran out to Abraham's servant, who was standing by his camels at the well. ", "31": "Then Laban said, \u201cThe Lord has brought you safely here. Come home with me. There's no need for you to keep on standing outside. I have a room ready for you in our house, and there's also a place for your camels.\u201d", "32": "Abraham's servant went home with Laban, where Laban's servants unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed. Then they brought water into the house, so Abraham's servant and his men could wash their feet. ", "33": "After that, they brought in food. But the servant said, \u201cBefore I eat, I must tell you why I have come.\u201d \u201cGo ahead and tell us,\u201d Laban answered.", "34": "The servant explained: I am Abraham's servant.

", "41": "But if they refuse to let her come back with you, then you are freed from your promise.\u201d", "42": "When I came to the well today, I silently prayed, \u201cYou, Lord, are the God my master Abraham worships, so please lead me to a wife for his son ", "43": "while I am here at the well. When a young woman comes out to get water, I'll ask her to give me a drink.

When she had filled the jar, I asked her for a drink. ", "46": "She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, \u201cHave a drink. Then I'll get water for your camels.\u201d So I drank, and after that she got some water for my camels. ", "47": "I asked her who her father was, and she answered, \u201cMy father is Bethuel the son of Nahor and Milcah.\u201d Right away I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.

The Lord has already helped me find a wife for my master's son. Now let us return.\u201d", "57": "They answered, \u201cLet's ask Rebekah what she wants to do.\u201d ", "58": "They called her and asked, \u201cAre you willing to leave with this man right now?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answered.", "59": "So they agreed to let Rebekah and an old family servant woman[c] leave immediately with Abraham's servant and his men.

Then they got on camels and left with Abraham's servant and his men.", "62": "At that time Isaac was living in the southern part of Canaan near a place called \u201cThe Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.\u201d[d] ", "63-65": "One evening he was walking out in the fields, when suddenly he saw a group of people approaching on camels. So he started toward them. Rebekah saw him coming; she got down from her camel, and asked, \u201cWho is that man?\u201d \u201cHe is my master Isaac,\u201d the servant answered. Then Rebekah covered her face with her veil.[e]", "66": "The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.", "67": "Isaac took Rebekah into the tent[f] where his mother had lived before she died, and Rebekah became his wife. He loved her and was comforted over the loss of his mother."}

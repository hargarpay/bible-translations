The dense forest has been chopped down.", "3": "Listen! Shepherds are crying. Their glorious pastures have been ruined. Listen! Lions are roaring. The forests of the Jordan Valley are no more to be found.", "4": "The Lord my God said to me: Tend those sheep doomed for slaughter! ", "5": "The people who buy and butcher them go unpunished, while everyone who sells them says, \u201cPraise the Lord! I'm rich.\u201d Not even their shepherds have pity on them.", "6": "Tend those sheep because I, the Lord, will no longer have pity on the people of this earth. I'll turn neighbor against neighbor and make them slaves of a king. They will bring disaster on the earth, and I'll do nothing to rescue any of them.", "7": "So I became a shepherd of those sheep doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep dealers.[a] And I gave names to the two sticks I used for tending the sheep: One of them was named \u201cMercy\u201d and the other \u201cUnity.\u201d ", "8": "In less than a month, I became impatient with three shepherds who didn't like me, and I got rid of them. ", "9": "Then I said, \u201cI refuse to be your shepherd. Let the sheep that are going to die, go on and die, and those that are going to be destroyed, go on and be destroyed. Then let the others eat one another alive.\u201d", "10": "On that same day, I broke the stick named \u201cMercy\u201d to show that the Lord had canceled his agreement with all people.

Then the Lord said, \u201cThrow the money into the treasury.\u201d[b] So I threw the money into the treasury at the Lord's temple. ", "14": "Then I broke the stick named \u201cUnity\u201d and canceled the ties between Judah and Israel.", "15": "Next, the Lord said to me, \u201cAct like a shepherd again\u2014this time a worthless shepherd. ", "16": "Once more I am going to let a worthless nobody rule the land\u2014one who won't care for the strays or search for the young or heal the sick or feed the healthy. He will just dine on the fattest sheep, leaving nothing but a few bones.\u201d", "17": "You worthless shepherd, deserting the sheep! I hope a sword will cripple your arm and blind your right eye."}

The officials got together a large work force that stopped up the springs and streams near Jerusalem.", "5": "Hezekiah also had workers repair the broken sections of the city wall. Then they built defense towers and an outer wall to help protect the one already there. The landfill on the east side of David's City was also strengthened.

Believe me, your God cannot keep you safe!", "16": "The Assyrian officials said terrible things about the Lord God and his servant Hezekiah. ", "17": "Sennacherib's letter even made fun of the Lord.

He prayed, and the Lord gave him a sign that he would recover. ", "25": "But Hezekiah was so proud that he refused to thank the Lord for everything he had done for him.

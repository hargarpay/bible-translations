We're dedicated to God.\u201d Such people are like smoke, irritating my nose all day.", "6": "I have written this down; I won't keep silent. I'll pay them back just as their sins deserve.", "7": "I, the Lord, will make them pay for their sins and for those of their ancestors\u2014 they have disgraced me by burning incense on mountains.", "8": "Here is what the Lord says: A cluster of grapes that produces wine is worth keeping!

What will happen to you for offering food and wine to the gods you call \u201cGood Luck\u201d and \u201cFate\u201d?", "12": "Your luck will end! I will see to it that you are slaughtered with swords. You refused to answer when I called out; you paid no attention to my instructions. Instead, you did what I hated, knowing it was wrong.", "13": "I, the Lord God, will give food and drink to my servants, and they will celebrate.

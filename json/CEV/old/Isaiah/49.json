{"1": "Everyone, listen, even you foreign nations across the sea. The Lord chose me and gave me a name before I was born.", "2": "He made my words pierce like a sharp sword or a pointed arrow; he kept me safely hidden in the palm of his hand.", "3": "The Lord said to me, \u201cIsrael, you are my servant; and because of you I will be highly honored.\u201d", "4": "I said to myself, \u201cI'm completely worn out; my time has been wasted. But I did it for the Lord God, and he will reward me.\u201d", "5": "Even before I was born, the Lord God chose me to serve him and to lead back the people of Israel. So the Lord has honored me and made me strong.", "6": "Now the Lord says to me, \u201cIt isn't enough for you to be merely my servant. You must do more than lead back survivors from the tribes of Israel. I have placed you here as a light for other nations; you must take my saving power to everyone on earth.\u201d", "7": "Israel, I am the holy Lord God, the one who rescues you. You are slaves of rulers and of a nation who despises you.[a] Now this is what I promise: Kings and rulers will honor you by kneeling at your feet. You can trust me! I am your Lord, the holy God of Israel, and you are my chosen ones.", "8": "This is what the Lord says: I will answer your prayers because I have set a time when I will help by coming to save you. I have chosen you to take my promise of hope to other nations.[b] You will rebuild the country from its ruins, then people will come and settle there.", "9": "You will set prisoners free from dark dungeons to see the light of day. On their way home, they will find plenty to eat, even on barren hills.", "10": "They won't go hungry or get thirsty; they won't be bothered by the scorching sun or hot desert winds. I will be merciful while leading them along to streams of water.", "11": "I will level the mountains and make roads.", "12": "Then my people will return from distant lands in the north and the west and from the city of Syene.[c]", "13": "Tell the heavens and the earth to celebrate and sing; command every mountain to join in the song. The Lord's people have suffered, but he has shown mercy and given them comfort.", "14": "The people of Zion said, \u201cThe Lord has turned away and forgotten us.\u201d", "15": "The Lord answered, \u201cCould a mother forget a child who nurses at her breast? Could she fail to love an infant who came from her own body? Even if a mother could forget, I will never forget you.", "16": "A picture of your city is drawn on my hand. You are always in my thoughts!", "17": "\u201cYour city will be built faster than it was destroyed[d]\u2014 those who attacked it will retreat and leave.", "18": "Look around! You will see your people coming home. As surely as I live, I, the Lord, promise that your city with its people will be as lovely as a bride wearing her jewelry.\u201d", "19": "Jerusalem is now in ruins! Nothing is left of the city. But it will be rebuilt and soon overcrowded; its cruel enemies will be gone far away.", "20": "Jerusalem is a woman whose children were born while she was in deep sorrow[e] over the loss of her husband. Now those children will come and seek room in the crowded city,", "21": "and Jerusalem will ask, \u201cAm I really their mother? How could I have given birth when I was still mourning in a foreign land? Who raised these children? Where have they come from?\u201d", "22": "The Lord God says: \u201cI will soon give a signal for the nations to return your sons and your daughters to the arms of Jerusalem.", "23": "The kings and queens of those nations where they were raised will come and bow down. They will take care of you just like a slave taking care of a child. Then you will know that I am the Lord. You won't be disappointed if you trust me.\u201d", "24": "Is it possible to rescue victims from someone strong and cruel?[f]", "25": "But the Lord has promised to fight on our side and to rescue our children from those strong and violent enemies.", "26": "He will make those cruel people dine on their own flesh and get drunk from drinking their own blood. Then everyone will know that the Lord is our Savior; the powerful God of Israel has rescued his people."}

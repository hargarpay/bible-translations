They used the other two wings for flying, ", "3": "as they shouted, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, Lord All-Powerful! The earth is filled with your glory.\u201d", "4": "As they shouted, the doorposts of the temple shook, and the temple was filled with smoke. ", "5": "Then I cried out, \u201cI'm doomed! Everything I say is sinful, and so are the words of everyone around me. Yet I have seen the King, the Lord All-Powerful.\u201d", "6": "One of the flaming creatures flew over to me with a burning coal that it had taken from the altar with a pair of metal tongs.

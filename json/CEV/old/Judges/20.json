Men who could serve as soldiers came from everywhere in Israel\u2014from Dan in the north, Beersheba in the south, and Gilead east of the Jordan River. Four hundred thousand of them came to Mizpah, and they each felt the same about what those men from the tribe of Benjamin had done. News about the meeting at Mizpah reached the tribe of Benjamin.

And wherever the messengers went, they said, \u201cHow could those worthless men in Gibeah do such a disgusting thing? ", "13": "We can't allow such a terrible crime to go unpunished in Israel!

They sat on the ground, crying and not eating for the rest of the day.

They killed about thirty Israelites in the fields and along the road between Gibeah and Bethel. The men of Benjamin were thinking, \u201cWe're mowing them down like we did before.\u201d The Israelites were running away, but they headed for Baal-Tamar, where they regrouped. They had set an ambush, and they were sure it would work. Ten thousand of Israel's best soldiers had been hiding west of Gibeah,[i] and as soon as the men of Benjamin chased the Israelites into the countryside, these ten thousand soldiers made a surprise attack on the town gates. They dashed in and captured Gibeah, killing everyone there. Then they set the town on fire, because the smoke would be the signal for the other Israelite soldiers to turn and attack the soldiers of Benjamin. The fighting had been so heavy around the soldiers of Benjamin, that they did not know the trouble they were in. But then they looked back and saw clouds of smoke rising from the town. They looked in front and saw the soldiers of Israel turning to attack. This terrified them, because they realized that something horrible was happening.

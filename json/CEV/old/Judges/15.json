", "2": "\u201cWhen you left the way you did, I thought you were divorcing[b] her. So I arranged for her to marry one of the young men who were at your party. But my younger daughter is even prettier, and you can have her as your wife.\u201d", "3": "\u201cThis time,\u201d Samson answered, \u201cI have a good reason for really hurting some Philistines.\u201d", "4": "Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them together in pairs with oil-soaked rags around their tails. ", "5": "Then Samson took the foxes into the Philistine wheat fields that were ready to be harvested. He set the rags on fire and let the foxes go. The wheat fields went up in flames, and so did the stacks of wheat that had already been cut. Even the Philistine vineyards and olive orchards burned.", "6": "Some of the Philistines started asking around, \u201cWho could have done such a thing?\u201d \u201cIt was Samson,\u201d someone told them. \u201cHe married the daughter of that man in Timnah, but then the man gave Samson's wife to one of the men at the wedding.\u201d The Philistine leaders went to Timnah and burned to death Samson's wife and her father.[c]", "7": "When Samson found out what they had done, he went to them and said, \u201cYou killed them! And I won't rest until I get even with you.\u201d ", "8": "Then Samson started hacking them to pieces with his sword.[d] Samson left Philistia and went to live in the cave at Etam Rock. ", "9": "But it wasn't long before the Philistines invaded Judah[e] and set up a huge army camp at Jawbone.[f]", "10": "The people of Judah asked, \u201cWhy have you invaded our land?\u201d The Philistines answered, \u201cWe've come to get Samson. We're going to do the same things to him that he did to our people.\u201d", "11": "Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson, \u201cDon't you know that the Philistines rule us, and they will punish us for what you did?\u201d \u201cI was only getting even with them,\u201d Samson replied. \u201cThey did the same things to me first.\u201d", "12": "\u201cWe came here to tie you up and turn you over to them,\u201d said the men of Judah. \u201cI won't put up a fight,\u201d Samson answered, \u201cbut you have to promise not to hurt me yourselves.\u201d", "13-14": "\u201cWe promise,\u201d the men said. \u201cWe will only tie you up and turn you over to the Philistines. We won't kill you.\u201d Then they tied up his hands and arms with two brand-new ropes and led him away from Etam Rock. When the Philistines saw that Samson was being brought to their camp at Jawbone, they started shouting and ran toward him. But the Lord's Spirit took control of Samson, and Samson broke the ropes, as though they were pieces of burnt cloth. ", "15": "Samson glanced around and spotted the jawbone of a donkey. The jawbone had not yet dried out, so it was still hard and heavy. Samson grabbed it and started hitting Philistines\u2014he killed a thousand of them! ", "16": "After the fighting was over, he made up this poem about what he had done to the Philistines: I used a donkey's jawbone to kill a thousand men; I beat them with this jawbone over and over again.[g]", "17": "Samson tossed the jawbone on the ground and decided to call the place Jawbone Hill.[h] It is still called that today.", "18": "Samson was so thirsty that he prayed, \u201cOur Lord, you helped me win a battle against a whole army. Please don't let me die of thirst now. Those heathen Philistines will carry off my dead body.\u201d", "19": "Samson was tired and weary, but God sent water gushing from a rock.[i] Samson drank some and felt strong again. Samson named the place Caller Spring,[j] because he had called out to God for help. The spring is still there at Jawbone.", "20": "Samson was a leader[k] of Israel for twenty years, but the Philistines were still the rulers of Israel."}

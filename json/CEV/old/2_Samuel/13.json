{"1": "David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar, who was the sister of Absalom. She was also the half sister of Amnon,[a] who fell in love with her. ", "2": "But Tamar was a virgin, and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick.", "3": "Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted, ", "4": "and he said to Amnon, \u201cWhat's the matter? You're the king's son! You shouldn't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning.\u201d Amnon said, \u201cI'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\u201d", "5": "Jonadab told him, \u201cLie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him to send Tamar, so you can watch her cook something for you. Then she can serve you the food.\u201d", "6": "So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, \u201cPlease, ask Tamar to come over. She can make some special bread[b] while I watch, and then she can serve me the bread.\u201d", "7": "David told Tamar, \u201cGo over to Amnon's house and fix him some food.\u201d ", "8": "When she got there, he was lying in bed. She mixed the dough, made the loaves, and baked them while he watched. ", "9": "Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it. Amnon said, \u201cSend the servants out of the house.\u201d After they had gone, ", "10": "he said to Tamar, \u201cServe the food in my bedroom.\u201d Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon's bedroom. ", "11": "But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, \u201cCome to bed with me!\u201d", "12": "She answered, \u201cNo! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's too disgusting! ", "13": "Think of me. I'll be disgraced forever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but trash! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.\u201d", "14": "But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her. ", "15": "Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, \u201cGet up and get out!\u201d", "16": "She said, \u201cDon't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.\u201d But Amnon would not listen. ", "17": "He called in his servant and said, \u201cThrow this woman out and lock the door!\u201d", "18": "The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her. The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves.[c] ", "19": "Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away.", "20": "Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, \u201cHow could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.\u201d Tamar soon moved into Absalom's house, but she was always sad and lonely. ", "21": "When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his oldest son and also his favorite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy.[d]", "22": "Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar.", "23": "Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all of the king's sons to be there.[e] ", "24": "Then he went to David and said, \u201cMy servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!\u201d", "25": "David answered, \u201cNo, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.\u201d Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time.", "26": "Absalom said, \u201cIf you won't go, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.\u201d David asked, \u201cWhy should he go with you?\u201d ", "27": "But Absalom kept on insisting, and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.[f] ", "28": "But he told his servants, \u201cKeep an eye on Amnon. When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling good, I'll give the signal. Then kill him! I've commanded you to do it, so don't be afraid. Be strong and brave.\u201d", "29": "Absalom's servants killed Amnon, just as Absalom had told them. The rest of the king's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom.", "30": "While they were on their way to Jerusalem, someone told David, \u201cAbsalom has killed all of your sons! Not even one is left.\u201d ", "31": "David got up, and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground. His servants remained standing, but they tore their clothes too.", "32": "Then David's nephew[g] Jonadab said, \u201cYour Majesty, not all of your sons were killed! Only Amnon is dead. On the day that Amnon raped Tamar, Absalom decided to kill him. ", "33": "Don't worry about the report that all your sons were killed. Only Amnon is dead, ", "34": "and Absalom has run away.\u201d One of the guards noticed a lot of people coming along the hillside on the road to Horonaim.[h] He went and told the king, \u201cI saw some men coming along Horonaim Road.\u201d[i]", "35": "Jonadab said, \u201cYour Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.\u201d", "36": "No sooner had he said it, than David's sons came in. They were weeping out loud, and David and all his officials cried just as loudly. ", "37-38": "David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead. Absalom had run away to Geshur, where he stayed for three years with King Talmai[j] the son of Ammihud. ", "39": "David still felt so sad over the loss of Amnon that he wanted to take his army there and capture Absalom.[k]"}

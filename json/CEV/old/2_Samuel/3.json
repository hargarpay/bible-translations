But Saul's son Ishbosheth[b] told Abner, \u201cYou shouldn't have slept with one of my father's wives!\u201d", "8": "Abner was very angry at what Ishbosheth had said, and he told Ishbosheth: Am I some kind of worthless dog from Judah? I've always been loyal to your father's family and to his relatives and friends. I haven't turned you over to David. And yet you talk to me as if I've committed a crime with this woman.", "9": "I ask God to punish me if I don't help David get what the Lord promised him! ", "10": "God said that he wouldn't let anyone in Saul's family ever be king again and that David would be king instead.

", "18": "So do it! After all, God said he would use his servant David to rescue his people Israel from their enemies, especially from the Philistines.\u201d", "19": "Finally, Abner talked with the tribe of Benjamin. Then he left for Hebron to tell David everything that the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the people of Israel wanted to do.

He wants to find out how strong your army is and to know everything you're doing.\u201d", "26": "Joab left David, then he sent some messengers to catch up with Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah,[f] but David did not know anything about it. ", "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pretended he wanted to talk privately with him. So he took Abner into one of the small rooms that were part of the town gate and stabbed him in the stomach. Joab killed him because Abner had killed Joab's brother Asahel.", "28": "David heard how Joab had killed Abner, and he said, \u201cI swear to the Lord that I am completely innocent of Abner's death! ", "29": "Joab and his family are the guilty ones. I pray that Joab's family will always be sick with sores and other skin diseases. May they all be cowards,[g] and may they die in war or starve to death.\u201d", "30": "Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.", "31": "David told Joab and everyone with him, \u201cShow your sorrow by tearing your clothes and wearing sackcloth![h] Walk in front of Abner's body and cry!\u201d David walked behind the stretcher on which Abner's body was being carried.

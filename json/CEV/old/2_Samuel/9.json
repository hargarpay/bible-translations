{"1": "One day, David thought, \u201cI wonder if any of Saul's family are still alive. If they are, I will be kind to them, because I made a promise to Jonathan.\u201d ", "2": "David called in Ziba, one of the servants of Saul's family. David said, \u201cSo you are Ziba.\u201d \u201cYes, Your Majesty, I am.\u201d", "3": "David asked, \u201cAre any of Saul's family still alive? If there are, I want to be kind to them.\u201d Ziba answered, \u201cOne of Jonathan's sons is still alive, but he can't walk.\u201d", "4": "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d David asked. Ziba replied, \u201cHe lives in Lo-Debar with Machir the son of Ammiel.\u201d", "5-6": "David sent some servants to bring Jonathan's son from Lo-Debar. His name was Mephibosheth,[a] and he was the grandson of Saul. He came to David and knelt down. David asked, \u201cAre you Mephibosheth?\u201d \u201cYes, I am, Your Majesty.\u201d", "7": "David said, \u201cDon't be afraid. I'll be kind to you because Jonathan was your father. I'm going to give you back the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul. Besides that, you will always eat with me at my table.\u201d", "8": "Mephibosheth knelt down again and said, \u201cWhy should you care about me? I'm worth no more than a dead dog.\u201d", "9": "David called in Ziba, Saul's chief servant, and told him, \u201cSince Mephibosheth is Saul's grandson, I've given him back everything that belonged to your master Saul and his family. ", "10": "You and your fifteen sons and twenty servants will work for Mephibosheth. You will farm his land and bring in his crops, so that Saul's family and servants[b] will have food. But Mephibosheth will always eat with me at my table.\u201d", "11-13": "Ziba replied, \u201cYour Majesty, I will do exactly what you tell me to do.\u201d So Ziba's family and servants worked for Mephibosheth. Mephibosheth was lame, but he lived in Jerusalem and ate at David's[c] table, just like one of David's own sons. And he had a young son of his own, named Mica."}

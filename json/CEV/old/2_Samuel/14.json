Go to the king and pretend you have spent a long time mourning the death of a loved one.\u201d Then he told her what to say.", "4": "The woman from Tekoa went to David. She bowed very low and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please help me!\u201d", "5": "David asked, \u201cWhat's the matter?\u201d She replied: My husband is dead, and I'm a widow. ", "6": "I had two sons, but they got into a fight out in a field where there was no one to pull them apart, and one of them killed the other. ", "7": "Now all of my relatives have come to me and said, \u201cHand over your son! We're going to put him to death for killing his brother.\u201d But what they really want is to get rid of him, so they can take over our land. Please don't let them put out my only flame of hope! There won't be anyone left on this earth to carry on my husband's name.", "8": "\u201cGo on home,\u201d David told her. \u201cI'll take care of this matter for you.\u201d", "9": "The woman said, \u201cI hope your decision doesn't cause any problems for you.

Your own son had to leave the country. And when you judged in my favor, it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back. ", "14": "We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground. But God doesn't take our lives.[b] Instead, he figures out ways of bringing us back when we run away.", "15": "Your Majesty, I came here to tell you about my problem, because I was afraid of what someone might do to me. I decided to come to you, because I thought you could help. ", "16": "In fact, I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us.[c]", "17": "I can rest easy now that you have given your decision. You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God, and I pray that the Lord your God will be with you.", "18": "Then David said to the woman, \u201cNow I'm going to ask you a question, and don't try to hide the truth!\u201d The woman replied, \u201cPlease go ahead, Your Majesty.\u201d", "19": "David asked, \u201cDid Joab put you up to this?\u201d The woman answered, \u201cYour Majesty, I swear by your life that no one can hide the truth from you.

Go and bring Absalom back.\u201d", "22": "Joab bowed very low and said, \u201cYour Majesty, I thank you for giving your permission.

I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now! If I'm guilty, let him kill me.\u201d", "33": "Joab went to David and told him what Absalom had said. David sent for Absalom, and Absalom came. He bowed very low, and David leaned over and kissed him."}

Then they told David, \u201cThe people from Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul.\u201d", "5": "David sent messengers to tell them: The Lord bless you! You were kind enough to bury Saul your ruler, ", "6": "and I pray that the Lord will be kind and faithful to you. I will be your friend because of what you have done. ", "7": "Saul is dead, but the tribe of Judah has made me their king. So be strong and have courage.", "8": "Abner the son of Ner[a] had been the general of Saul's army. He took Saul's son Ishbosheth[b] across the Jordan River to Mahanaim ", "9": "and made him king of Israel,[c] including the areas of Gilead, Asher,[d] Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin. ", "10": "Ishbosheth was forty years old at the time, and he ruled for two years. But the tribe of Judah made David their king, ", "11": "and he ruled from Hebron for seven and a half years.", "12": "One day, Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth[e] left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.

", "14": "Abner yelled to Joab, \u201cLet's have some of our best soldiers get up and fight each other!\u201d Joab agreed, ", "15": "and twelve of Ishbosheth's men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of David's men. ", "16": "They grabbed each other by the hair and stabbed each other in the side with their daggers. They all died right there! That's why the place in Gibeon is called \u201cField of Daggers.\u201d[h] ", "17": "Then everyone started fighting. Both sides fought very hard, but David's soldiers defeated Abner and the soldiers of Israel.", "18": "Zeruiah's three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a deer in an open field, ", "19": "and he ran straight after Abner, without looking to the right or to the left.", "20": "When Abner turned and saw him, he said, \u201cIs that you, Asahel?\u201d Asahel answered, \u201cYes it is.\u201d", "21": "Abner said, \u201cThere are soldiers all around. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.\u201d But Asahel refused to stop.", "22": "Abner said, \u201cIf you don't turn back, I'll have to kill you! Then I could never face your brother Joab again.\u201d", "23": "But Asahel would not turn back, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still.

", "25": "Abner brought the men of Benjamin together in one group on top of a hill, and they got ready to fight.", "26": "Abner shouted to Joab, \u201cAren't we ever going to stop killing each other? Don't you know that the longer we keep on doing this, the worse it's going to be when it's all over? When are you going to order your men to stop chasing their own relatives?\u201d", "27": "Joab shouted back, \u201cI swear by the living God, if you hadn't spoken, my men would have chased their relatives all night!\u201d ", "28": "Joab took his trumpet and blew the signal for his soldiers to stop chasing the soldiers of Israel. Right away, the fighting stopped.", "29": "Abner and his troops marched through the Jordan River valley all that night. Then they crossed the river and marched all morning[i] until they arrived back at Mahanaim.", "30": "As soon as Joab stopped chasing Abner, he got David's troops together and counted them. There were nineteen missing besides Asahel. ", "31": "But David's soldiers had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin.

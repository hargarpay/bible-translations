", "4": "The first was like a lion with the wings of an eagle. As I watched, its wings were pulled off. Then it was lifted to an upright position and made to stand on two feet, just like a human, and it was given a human mind.", "5": "The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs.[b] It held three ribs in its teeth, and it was told, \u201cAttack! Eat all the flesh you want.\u201d", "6": "The third beast was like a leopard\u2014except that it had four wings and four heads. It was given authority to rule.", "7": "The fourth beast was stronger and more terrifying than the others. Its huge teeth were made of iron, and what it didn't grind with its teeth, it smashed with its feet. It was different from the others, and it had horns on its head\u2014ten of them.

He will rule forever, and his kingdom is eternal, never to be destroyed.", "15": "Daniel wrote: I was terrified by these visions, and I didn't know what to think.

Don't forget that Esau was the brother of your ancestor Jacob, but I chose Jacob ", "3": "instead of Esau. And I turned Esau's hill country into a barren desert where jackals[a] roam. ", "4": "Esau's descendants may say, \u201cAlthough our nation Edom is in ruins, we will rebuild.\u201d But I, the Lord All-Powerful, promise to tear down whatever they build.

I will punish you for this, because I am the great King, the Lord All-Powerful, and I am worshiped by nations everywhere."}

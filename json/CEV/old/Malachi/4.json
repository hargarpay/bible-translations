{"1": "The Lord said: The day of judgment is certain to come. And it will be like a red-hot furnace with flames that burn up proud and sinful people, as though they were straw. Not a branch or a root will be left. I, the Lord All-Powerful, have spoken! ", "2": "But for you that honor my name, victory will shine like the sun with healing in its rays, and you will jump around like calves at play. ", "3": "When I come to bring justice, you will trample those who are evil, as though they were ashes under your feet. I, the Lord All-Powerful, have spoken!", "4": "Don't ever forget the laws and teachings I gave my servant Moses on Mount Sinai.[a]", "5": "I, the Lord, promise to send the prophet Elijah before that great and terrible day comes. ", "6": "He will lead children and parents to love each other more, so that when I come, I won't bring doom to the land."}

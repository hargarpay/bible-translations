These seven nations have more people and are stronger than Israel, but when you attack them, ", "2": "the Lord will force them out of the land. Then you must destroy them without mercy. Don't make any peace treaties with them, ", "3": "and don't let your sons and daughters marry any of them. ", "4": "If you do, those people will lead your descendants to worship other gods and to turn their backs on the Lord. That will make him very angry, and he will quickly destroy Israel.", "5": "So when you conquer these nations, tear down the altars where they worship their gods. Break up their sacred stones, cut down the poles that they use in worshiping the goddess Asherah, and throw their idols in the fire.", "6": "Moses said: Israel, you are the chosen people of the Lord your God. There are many nations on this earth, but he chose only Israel to be his very own. ", "7": "You were the weakest of all nations, ", "8": "but the Lord chose you because he loves you and because he had made a promise to your ancestors. Then with his mighty arm, he rescued you from the king of Egypt, who had made you his slaves.", "9": "You know that the Lord your God is the only true God. So love him and obey his commands, and he will faithfully keep his agreement with you and your descendants for a thousand generations.

Your herds of cattle will have many calves, and your flocks of sheep will have many lambs.

", "15": "You will no longer suffer with the same horrible diseases that you sometimes had in Egypt. You will be healthy, but the Lord will make your enemies suffer from those diseases.", "16": "Moses said to Israel: When the Lord helps you defeat your enemies, you must destroy them without pity! And don't get trapped into worshiping their gods.", "17": "You may be thinking, \u201cHow can we destroy these nations? They are more powerful than we are.\u201d ", "18": "But stop worrying! Just remember what the Lord your God did to Egypt and its king. ", "19": "You saw how the Lord used his tremendous power to work great miracles and bring you out of Egypt. And he will again work miracles for you when you face these enemies you fear so much.

You will defeat them one after another until they are gone, and no one will remember they ever lived.", "25": "After you conquer a nation, burn their idols.

In the letter, I wrote ", "4": "that the Lord All-Powerful, the God of Israel, had said: I had you taken from Jerusalem to Babylonia. Now I tell you ", "5": "to settle there and build houses. Plant gardens and eat what you grow in them. ", "6": "Get married and have children, then help your sons find wives and help your daughters find husbands, so they can have children as well.

The nations will sneer and make fun of them and use the names \u201cJudah\u201d and \u201cJerusalem\u201d as curse words.

So I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar, who will put them to death while the rest of you watch.

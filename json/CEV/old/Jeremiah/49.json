So why have you worshipers of the god Milcom[a] taken over towns and land belonging to the Gad tribe?", "2": "Someday I will send an army to attack you in Rabbah, your capital city. It will be left in ruins, and the surrounding villages will lie in ashes. You took some of Israel's land, but on that day Israel will take yours!", "3": "Cry, people of Heshbon;[b] your town will become a pile of rubble.[c] You will turn here and there, but your path will be blocked.[d] Put on sackcloth[e] and mourn, you citizens of Rabbah, because the idol you worship[f] will be taken to a foreign country, along with its priests and temple officials.", "4": "You rebellious Ammonites trust your wealth and ask, \u201cWho could attack us?\u201d But I warn you not to boast when your strength is fading.[g]", "5": "I, the Lord All-Powerful, will send neighboring nations to strike you with terror. You will be scattered, with no one to care for your refugees.", "6": "Yet someday, I will bring your people back home. I, the Lord, have spoken.", "7-8": "The Lord All-Powerful says about Edom: Wisdom and common sense have vanished from Teman.[h] I will send disaster to punish you descendants of Esau,[i] so anyone from Dedan[j] had better turn around and run back home.[k]", "9": "People who harvest grapes leave some for the poor. Thieves who break in at night take only what they want.", "10": "But I will take everything that belongs to you, people of Edom, and I will uncover every place where you try to hide. Then you will die, and so will your children, relatives, and neighbors.", "11": "But I can be trusted to care for your orphans and widows.", "12": "Even those nations that don't deserve to be punished will have to drink from the cup of my anger. So how can you possibly hope to escape? ", "13": "I, the Lord, swear in my own name that your city of Bozrah[l] and all your towns will suffer a horrible fate. They will lie in ruins forever, and people will use the name \u201cBozrah\u201d as a curse word.", "14": "I have sent a messenger to command the nations to prepare for war against you people of Edom.", "15": "Your nation will be small, yet hated by other nations.", "16": "Pride tricks you into thinking that other nations look at you with fear.[m] You live along the cliffs and high in the mountains like the eagles, but I am the Lord, and I will bring you down.", "17": "People passing by your country will be shocked and horrified to see a disaster", "18": "as bad as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and towns nearby. The towns of Edom will be empty.", "19": "I will attack you like a lion from the forest, attacking sheep in a meadow along the Jordan. In a moment the flock runs, and the land is empty. Who will I choose to attack you? I will do it myself! No one can force me to fight or chase me away.", "20": "Listen to my plans for you, people of Edom.[n] Your children will be dragged off and your country destroyed.", "21": "The sounds of your destruction will reach the Red Sea[o] and cause the earth to shake.", "22": "An enemy will swoop down to attack you, like an eagle spreading its wings and circling over Bozrah.

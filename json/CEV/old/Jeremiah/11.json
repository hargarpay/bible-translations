So pay attention to what it says. ", "4": "My commands haven't changed since I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, a nation that seemed like a blazing furnace where iron ore is melted. I told your ancestors that if they obeyed my commands, I would be their God, and they would be my people. ", "5": "Then I did what I had promised and gave them this wonderful land, where you now live. \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d I replied, \u201cthat's true.\u201d", "6": "Then the Lord told me to say to everyone on the streets of Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah: Pay attention to the commands in my agreement with you.

You have refused to listen, and instead you have done whatever your sinful hearts have desired. You have not kept the agreement we made, so I will make you suffer every curse that goes with it.", "9": "The Lord said to me: Jeremiah, the people of Judah and Jerusalem are plotting against me. ", "10": "They have sinned in the same way their ancestors did, by turning from me and worshiping other gods. The northern kingdom of Israel broke the agreement I made with your ancestors, and now the southern kingdom of Judah[a] has done the same.", "11": "Here is what I've decided to do. I will bring suffering on the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and no one will escape. They will beg me to help, but I won't listen to their prayers.

I can't stop you.\u201d", "6": "Then they took me back to the courtyard of the palace guards and let me down with ropes into the well that belonged to Malchiah, the king's son. There was no water in the well, and I sank down in the mud.", "7-8": "Ebedmelech from Ethiopia[c] was an official at the palace, and he heard what they had done to me.

No one else can hear what we say, and I won't let anyone kill you.\u201d", "17": "Then I told him that the Lord had said: \u201cZedekiah, I am the Lord God All-Powerful, the God of Israel. I promise that if you surrender to King Nebuchadnezzar's[g] officers, you and your family won't be killed, and Jerusalem won't be burned down.

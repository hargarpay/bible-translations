Now, get a scroll[c] and write down everything I have told you, ", "3": "then read it to the people of Judah. Maybe they will stop sinning when they hear what terrible things I plan for them.

So Baruch took the scroll to the upper courtyard of the temple. He went over to the side of the courtyard and stood in a covered area near New Gate, where he read the scroll aloud. This covered area belonged to Gemariah,[f] one of the king's highest officials. ", "11": "Gemariah's son Micaiah was there and heard Baruch read what the Lord had said.

It was the ninth month[i] of the year, so there was a fire burning in the fireplace,[j] and the king was sitting nearby. After the officials told the king about the scroll, he sent Jehudi to get it.

Then I told him what to write, so this second scroll would contain even more than was on the scroll Jehoiakim had burned."}

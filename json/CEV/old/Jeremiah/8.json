These bones will be scattered and left lying on the ground like trash, where the sun and moon and stars can shine on them.", "3": "Some of you people of Judah will be left alive, but I will force you to go to foreign countries, and you will wish you were dead. I, the Lord God All-Powerful, have spoken.", "4": "The Lord said: People of Jerusalem, when you stumble and fall, you get back up, and if you take a wrong road, you turn around and go back.[a]", "5": "So why do you refuse to come back to me? Why do you hold so tightly to your false gods?", "6": "I listen carefully, but none of you admit that you've done wrong.

Listen! You'll hear them say, \u201cHas the Lord deserted Zion? Is he no longer its king?\u201d I hear the Lord reply, \u201cWhy did you make me angry by worshiping useless idols?\u201d", "20": "The people complain, \u201cSpring and summer have come and gone, but still the Lord hasn't rescued us.\u201d", "21": "My people are crushed, and so is my heart.

So now I'll really take care of you, and believe me, you will pay for your crimes!", "3": "I will bring the rest of my people home from the lands where I have scattered them, and they will grow into a mighty nation. ", "4": "I promise to choose leaders who will care for them like real shepherds. All of my people will be there, and they will never again be frightened.", "5": "Someday I will appoint an honest king from the family of David, a king who will be wise and rule with justice.", "6": "As long as he is king, Israel will have peace, and Judah will be safe. The name of this king will be \u201cThe Lord Gives Justice.\u201d", "7": "A time will come when you will again worship me. But you will no longer call me the Living God who rescued Israel from Egypt.

I, the Lord, have spoken.", "13": "The prophets in Samaria were disgusting to me, because they preached in the name of Baal and led my people astray.", "14": "And you prophets in Jerusalem are even worse. You're unfaithful in marriage[c] and never tell the truth.[d] You even lead others to sin instead of helping them turn back to me. You and the people of Jerusalem are evil like Sodom and Gomorrah.[e]", "15": "You prophets in Jerusalem have spread evil everywhere. That's why I, the Lord, promise to give you bitter poison to eat and drink.", "16": "The Lord said: Don't listen to the lies of these false prophets, you people of Judah! The message they preach is something they imagined; it did not come from me, the Lord All-Powerful.", "17": "These prophets go to people who refuse to respect me and who are stubborn and do whatever they want. The prophets tell them, \u201cThe Lord has promised everything will be fine.\u201d", "18": "But I, the Lord, tell you that these prophets have never attended a meeting of my council in heaven[f] or heard me speak.", "19": "They are evil!

", "29": "My words are a powerful fire; they are a hammer that shatters rocks.", "30-32": "These unfaithful prophets claim I give them their dreams, but it isn't true. I didn't choose them to be my prophets, and yet they babble on and on, speaking in my name, while stealing words from each other. And when my people hear these liars, they are led astray instead of being helped. So I warn you that I am now the enemy of these prophets. I, the Lord, have spoken.", "33": "The Lord said to me: Jeremiah, when a prophet or a priest or anyone else comes to you and asks, \u201cDoes the Lord have news for us?\u201d tell them, \u201cYou people are a nuisance[g] to the Lord, and he[h] will get rid of you.\u201d", "34": "If any of you say, \u201cHere is news from the Lord,\u201d I will punish you and your families, even if you are a prophet or a priest.

So if you say, \u201cHere is news from the Lord,\u201d you are twisting my words into a lie. Remember that I am your God, the Lord All-Powerful.", "37": "If you go to a prophet, it's all right to ask, \u201cWhat answer did the Lord give to my question?\u201d or \u201cWhat has the Lord said?\u201d ", "38": "But if you disobey me and say, \u201cHere is news from the Lord,\u201d ", "39": "I will pick you up[i] and throw you far away.

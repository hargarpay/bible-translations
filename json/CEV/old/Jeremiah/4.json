Your hearts have become hard, like unplowed ground where thornbushes grow.", "4": "With all your hearts, keep the agreement I made with you. But if you are stubborn and keep on sinning, my anger will burn like a fire that cannot be put out.", "5": "The Lord said: \u201cSound the trumpets, my people. Warn the people of Judah,[a] 'Run for your lives!", "6": "Head for Jerusalem or another walled town!' \u201cJeremiah, tell them I'm sending disaster from the north.", "7": "An army will come out, like a lion from its den.

I, the Lord, have spoken.", "18": "\u201cPeople of Judah, your hearts will be in pain, but it's your own fault that you will be punished.\u201d", "19": "I can't stand the pain! My heart pounds, as I twist and turn in agony. I hear the signal trumpet and the battle cry of the enemy, and I cannot be silent.", "20": "I see the enemy defeating us time after time, leaving everything in ruins. Even my own home is destroyed in a moment.", "21": "How long will I see enemy flags and hear their trumpets?", "22": "I heard the Lord say, \u201cMy people ignore me.

Terror is all around.", "6": "You are strong and run fast, but you can't escape. You fall in battle near the Euphrates River.", "7": "What nation is this, that rises like the Nile River overflowing its banks?", "8": "It is Egypt, rising with a roar like a raging river and saying, \u201cI'll flood the earth, destroying cities, and killing everyone in them.\u201d", "9": "Go ahead, Egypt. Tell your chariots and cavalry to attack and fight hard. Order your troops to march out, with Ethiopians[d] and Libyans carrying shields, and the Lydians[e] armed with bows and arrows.", "10": "But the Lord All-Powerful will win this battle and take revenge on his enemies. His sword will eat them and drink their blood until it is full.

Your capital, Memphis, will lie empty and in ruins.", "20": "An enemy from the north will attack you, beautiful Egypt, like a fly biting a cow.", "21": "The foreign soldiers you hired will turn and run.

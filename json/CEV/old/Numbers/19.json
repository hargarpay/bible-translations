", "4": "He will dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the direction of the sacred tent. ", "5": "Then the whole cow, including its skin, meat, blood, and insides must be burned. ", "6": "A priest[a] is to throw a stick of cedar wood, a hyssop[b] branch, and a piece of red yarn into the fire.", "7": "After the ceremony, the priest is to take a bath and wash his clothes. Only then can he go back into the camp, but he remains unclean and unfit for worship until evening. ", "8": "The man who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and take a bath, but he is also unclean until evening.", "9": "A man who isn't unclean must collect the ashes of the burnt cow and store them outside the camp in a clean place. The people of Israel can mix these ashes with the water used in the ceremony to wash away sin. ", "10": "The man who collects the ashes must wash his clothes, but will remain unclean until evening. This law must always be obeyed by the people of Israel and the foreigners living among them.", "11": "The Lord said: If you touch a dead body, you will be unclean for seven days. ", "12": "But if you wash with the water mixed with the cow's ashes on the third day and again on the seventh day, you will be clean and acceptable for worship.

That same person must dip a hyssop branch in the water and ashes, then sprinkle it on the tent and everything in it, including everyone who was inside. If you have touched a human bone, a grave, or a dead body, you must be sprinkled with that water. ", "19": "If this is done on the third day and on the seventh day, you will be clean. Then after you take a bath and wash your clothes, you can worship that evening.", "20": "If you are unclean and refuse to be made clean by washing with the water mixed with ashes, you will be guilty of making my sacred tent unclean, and you will no longer belong to the people of Israel.

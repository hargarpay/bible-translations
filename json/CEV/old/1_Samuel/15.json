{"1": "One day, Samuel told Saul: The Lord had me choose you to be king of his people, Israel. Now listen to this message from the Lord: ", "2": "\u201cWhen the Israelites were on their way out of Egypt, the nation of Amalek attacked them. I am the Lord All-Powerful, and now I am going to make Amalek pay!", "3": "\u201cGo and attack the Amalekites! Destroy them and all their possessions. Don't have any pity. Kill their men, women, children, and even their babies. Slaughter their cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.\u201d", "4": "Saul sent messengers who told every town and village to send men to join the army at Telaim. There were two hundred ten thousand troops in all, and ten thousand of these were from Judah. Saul organized them, ", "5": "then led them to a valley near one of the towns in[a] Amalek, where they got ready to make a surprise attack. ", "6": "Some Kenites lived nearby, and Saul told them, \u201cYour people were kind to our nation when we left Egypt, and I don't want you to get killed when I wipe out the Amalekites. Leave here and stay away from them.\u201d The Kenites left, ", "7": "and Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah[b] to Shur, which is just east of Egypt. ", "8": "Every Amalekite was killed except King Agag. ", "9": "Saul and his army let Agag live, and they also spared the best sheep and cattle. They didn't want to destroy anything of value, so they only killed the animals that were worthless or weak.[c]", "10": "The Lord told Samuel, ", "11": "\u201cSaul has stopped obeying me, and I'm sorry that I made him king.\u201d Samuel was angry, and he cried out in prayer to the Lord all night. ", "12": "Early the next morning he went to talk with Saul. Someone told him, \u201cSaul went to Carmel, where he had a monument built so everyone would remember his victory. Then he left for Gilgal.\u201d", "13": "Samuel finally caught up with Saul,[d] and Saul told him, \u201cI hope the Lord will bless you! I have done what the Lord told me.\u201d", "14": "\u201cThen why,\u201d Samuel asked, \u201cdo I hear sheep and cattle?\u201d", "15": "\u201cThe army took them from the Amalekites,\u201d Saul explained. \u201cThey kept the best sheep and cattle, so they could sacrifice them to the Lord your God. But we destroyed everything else.\u201d", "16": "\u201cStop!\u201d Samuel said. \u201cLet me tell you what the Lord told me last night.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d Saul answered.", "17": "Samuel continued, \u201cYou may not think you're very important, but the Lord chose you to be king, and you are in charge of the tribes of Israel. ", "18": "When the Lord sent you on this mission, he told you to wipe out those worthless Amalekites. ", "19": "Why didn't you listen to the Lord? Why did you keep the animals and make him angry?\u201d", "20": "\u201cBut I did listen to the Lord!\u201d Saul answered. \u201cHe sent me on a mission, and I went. I captured King Agag and destroyed his nation. ", "21": "All the animals were going to be destroyed[e] anyway. That's why the army brought the best sheep and cattle to Gilgal as sacrifices to the Lord your God.\u201d", "22": "\u201cTell me,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cDoes the Lord really want sacrifices and offerings? No! He doesn't want your sacrifices. He wants you to obey him. ", "23": "Rebelling against God or disobeying him because you are proud is just as bad as worshiping idols or asking them for advice. You refused to do what God told you, so God has decided that you can't be king.\u201d", "24": "\u201cI have sinned,\u201d Saul admitted. \u201cI disobeyed both you and the Lord. I was afraid of the army, and I listened to them instead. ", "25": "Please forgive me and come back with me so I can worship the Lord.\u201d", "26": "\u201cNo!\u201d Samuel replied, \u201cYou disobeyed the Lord, and I won't go back with you. Now the Lord has said that you can't be king of Israel any longer.\u201d", "27": "As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the edge of Samuel's robe. It tore! ", "28": "Samuel said, \u201cThe Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and he will give it to someone who is better than you. ", "29": "Besides, the eternal[f] God of Israel isn't a human being. He doesn't tell lies or change his mind.\u201d", "30": "Saul said, \u201cI did sin, but please honor me in front of the leaders of the army and the people of Israel. Come back with me, so I can worship the Lord your God.\u201d", "31": "Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the Lord. ", "32": "Then Samuel shouted, \u201cBring me King Agag of Amalek!\u201d Agag came in chains,[g] and he was saying to himself, \u201cSurely they won't kill me now.\u201d[h]", "33": "But Samuel said, \u201cAgag, you have snatched children from their mothers' arms and killed them. Now your mother will be without children.\u201d Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces at the place of worship in Gilgal.", "34": "Samuel went home to Ramah, and Saul returned to his home in Gibeah.

{"1-3": "Samuel had died some time earlier,[a] and people from all over Israel had attended his funeral in his hometown of Ramah. Meanwhile, Saul had been trying to get rid of everyone who spoke with the spirits of the dead.[b] But one day the Philistines brought their soldiers together to attack Israel. Achish told David, \u201cOf course, you know that you and your men must fight as part of our Philistine army.\u201d David answered, \u201cThat will give you a chance to see for yourself just how well we can fight!\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d Achish said, \u201cyou and your men will always be my bodyguards.\u201d", "4": "The Philistines went to Shunem and set up camp. Saul called the army of Israel together, and they set up their camp in Gilboa. ", "5": "Saul took one look at the Philistine army and started shaking with fear. ", "6": "So he asked the Lord what to do. But the Lord would not answer, either in a dream or by a priest or a prophet. ", "7": "Then Saul told his officers, \u201cFind me a woman who can talk to the spirits of the dead. I'll go to her and find out what's going to happen.\u201d His servants told him, \u201cThere's a woman at Endor who can talk to spirits of the dead.\u201d", "8": "That night, Saul put on different clothing so nobody would recognize him. Then he and two of his men went to the woman, and asked, \u201cWill you bring up the ghost of someone for us?\u201d", "9": "The woman said, \u201cWhy are you trying to trick me and get me killed? You know King Saul has gotten rid of everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead!\u201d", "10": "Saul replied, \u201cI swear by the living Lord that nothing will happen to you because of this.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWho do you want me to bring up?\u201d she asked. \u201cBring up the ghost of Samuel,\u201d he answered.", "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. Then she turned to Saul and said, \u201cYou've tricked me! You're the king!\u201d", "13": "\u201cDon't be afraid,\u201d Saul replied. \u201cJust tell me what you see.\u201d She answered, \u201cI see a spirit rising up out of the ground.\u201d", "14": "\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d \u201cIt looks like an old man wearing a robe.\u201d Saul knew it was Samuel, so he bowed down low.", "15": "\u201cWhy are you bothering me by bringing me up like this?\u201d Samuel asked. \u201cI'm terribly worried,\u201d Saul answered. \u201cThe Philistines are about to attack me. God has turned his back on me and won't answer any more by prophets or by dreams. What should I do?\u201d", "16": "Samuel said: If the Lord has turned away from you and is now your enemy, don't ask me what to do. ", "17": "I've already told you: The Lord has sworn to take the kingdom from you and give it to David. And that's just what he's doing! ", "18": "When the Lord was angry with the Amalekites, he told you to destroy them, but you didn't do it. That's why the Lord is doing this to you. ", "19": "Tomorrow the Lord will let the Philistines defeat Israel's army, then you and your sons will join me down here in the world of the dead.", "20": "At once, Saul collapsed and lay stretched out on the floor, terrified at what Samuel had said. He was weak because he had not eaten anything since the day before.", "21": "The woman came over to Saul, and when she saw that he was completely terrified, she said, \u201cYour Majesty, I listened to you and risked my life to do what you asked. ", "22": "Now please listen to me. Let me get you a little something to eat. It will give you strength for your walk back to camp.\u201d", "23": "\u201cNo, I won't eat!\u201d But his officers and the woman kept on urging Saul, until he finally agreed. He got up off the floor and sat on the bed. ", "24": "Right away the woman killed a calf that she had been fattening up. She cooked part of the meat and baked some thin bread.[c] ", "25": "Then she served the food to Saul and his officers, who ate and left before daylight."}

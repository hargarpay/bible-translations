", "6": "You harvest less than you plant, you never have enough to eat or drink, your clothes don't keep you warm, and your wages are stored in bags full of holes.", "7": "Think about what I have said! ", "8": "But first, go to the hills and get wood for my temple, so I can take pride in it and be worshiped there. ", "9": "You expected much, but received only a little.

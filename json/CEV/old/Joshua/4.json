Then have the men set up those rocks as a monument at the place where you camp tonight.", "4": "Joshua chose twelve men; he called them together, ", "5": "and told them: Go to the middle of the riverbed where the sacred chest is, and pick up a large rock. Carry it on your shoulder to our camp. There are twelve of you, so there will be one rock for each tribe. ", "6-7": "Someday your children will ask, \u201cWhy are these rocks here?\u201d Then you can tell them how the water stopped flowing when the chest was being carried across the river. These rocks will always remind our people of what happened here today.", "8": "The men followed the instructions that the Lord had given Joshua. They picked up twelve rocks, one for each tribe, and carried them to the camp, where they put them down.", "9": "Joshua had some other men set up a monument next to the place where the priests were standing. This monument was also made of twelve large rocks, and it is still there in the middle of the river.", "10-13": "The army got ready for battle and crossed the Jordan. They marched quickly past the sacred chest[b] and into the desert near Jericho. Forty thousand soldiers from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh[c] led the way, as Moses had ordered.[d] The priests stayed right where they were until the army had followed the orders that the Lord had given Moses and Joshua. Then the army watched as the priests carried the chest the rest of the way across.", "14-18": "\u201cJoshua,\u201d the Lord said, \u201chave the priests come up from the Jordan and bring the chest with them.\u201d So Joshua went over to the priests and told them what the Lord had said. And as soon as the priests carried the chest past the highest place that the floodwaters of the Jordan had reached, the river flooded its banks again. That's how the Lord showed the Israelites that Joshua was their leader.[e] For the rest of Joshua's life, they respected him as they had respected Moses.", "19": "It was the tenth day of the first month[f] of the year when Israel crossed the Jordan River.

", "21": "Then Joshua told the people: Years from now your children will ask you why these rocks are here.

He did the same thing here for us that he did for our people at the Red Sea,[g] ", "24": "because he wants everyone on earth to know how powerful he is. And he wants us to worship only him.\u201d"}

", "6-10": "They killed five hundred people in Susa,[b] but they did not take anything that belonged to the ones they killed. Haman had been one of the worst enemies of the Jews, and ten of his sons were among those who were killed. Their names were Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.", "11": "Later that day, someone told the king how many people had been killed in Susa.[c] ", "12": "Then he told Esther, \u201cFive hundred people, including Haman's ten sons, have been killed in Susa alone. If that many were killed here, what must have happened in the provinces? Is there anything else you want done? Just tell me, and it will be done.\u201d", "13": "Esther answered, \u201cYour Majesty, please let the Jews in Susa fight to defend themselves tomorrow, just as they did today.

Then he sent letters to the Jews everywhere in the provinces ", "21": "and told them: Each year you must celebrate on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar, ", "22": "the days when we Jews defeated our enemies. Remember this month as a time when our sorrow was turned to joy, and celebration took the place of crying.

In the letter they said: We pray that all of you will live in peace and safety.", "31": "You and your descendants must always remember to celebrate Purim at the time and in the way that we have said. You must also follow the instructions that we have given you about mourning and going without eating.[f]", "32": "These laws about Purim are written by the authority of Queen Esther."}

Now the city is shattered, and we will take its place.\u201d", "3": "Because the people of Tyre have sung that song, I have the following warning for them: I am the Lord God, and I am now your enemy! I will send nations to attack you, like waves crashing against the shore. ", "4": "They will tear down your city walls and defense towers. I will sweep away the ruins until all that's left of you is a bare rock, ", "5": "where fishermen can dry their nets along the coast. I promise that you will be robbed ", "6": "and that the people who live in your towns along the coast will be killed.

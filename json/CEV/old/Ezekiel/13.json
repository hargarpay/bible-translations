Tell them it's time to hear my message.", "3": "I, the Lord God, say those lying prophets are doomed! They don't see visions\u2014they make up their own messages! ", "4": "Israel's prophets are no better than jackals[a] that hunt for food among the ruins of a city. ", "5": "They don't warn the people about coming trouble or tell them how dangerous it is to sin against me. ", "6": "Those prophets lie by claiming they speak for me, but I have not even chosen them to be my prophets. And they still think their words will come true. ", "7": "They say they're preaching my messages, but they are full of lies\u2014I did not speak to them!", "8": "So I am going to punish those lying prophets for deceiving the people of Israel with false messages. ", "9": "I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people. They will not be allowed to call themselves Israelites or even to set foot in Israel. Then they will realize that I am the Lord God.", "10": "Those prophets refuse to be honest. They tell my people there will be peace, even though there's no peace to be found.

They use lies to sentence the innocent to death and to help the guilty go free. And my people believe them!", "20": "I hate the magic charms they use to trick people into believing their lies. I will rip those charms from their wrists and set free the people they have trapped like birds.[c] ", "21": "I will tear the scarves from their heads and rescue my people from their power once and for all. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.", "22": "They do things I would never do.

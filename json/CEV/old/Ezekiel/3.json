", "5-6": "They are Israelites, not some strangers who speak a foreign language you can't understand. If I were to send you to foreign nations, they would listen to you. ", "7": "But the people of Israel will refuse to listen, because they have refused to listen to me. All of them are stubborn and hardheaded, ", "8": "so I will make you as stubborn as they are. ", "9": "You will be so determined to speak my message that nothing will stop you. I will make you hard like a diamond, and you'll have no reason to be afraid of those arrogant rebels.", "10": "Listen carefully to everything I say and then think about it.

{"1": "The Lord said: Ezekiel, sing a funeral song for two of Israel's leaders:[a]", "2": "Your mother was a brave lioness who raised her cubs among lions.", "3": "She taught one of them to hunt, and he learned to eat people.", "4": "When the nations heard of him, they trapped him in a pit, then they used hooks to drag him to Egypt.", "5": "His mother waited for him to return. But soon she lost all hope and raised another cub, who also became fierce.", "6": "He hunted with other lions and learned to eat people.", "7": "He destroyed fortresses[b] and ruined towns; his mighty roar terrified everyone.", "8": "Nations plotted to kill him, and people came from all over to spread out a net and catch him in a trap.", "9": "They put him in a cage and took him to Babylonia. The lion was locked away, so that his mighty roar would never again be heard on Israel's hills.", "10": "Your mother was a vine[c] growing near a stream. There was plenty of water, so she was filled with branches and with lots of fruit.", "11": "Her strong branches became symbols of authority, and she was taller than all other trees\u2014 everyone could see how strong and healthy she was.", "12": "But in anger, I pulled her up by the roots and threw her to the ground, where the scorching desert wind dried out her fruit. Her strong branches wilted and burned up.", "13": "Then she was planted in a hot, dry desert,", "14": "where her stem caught fire, and flames burned her branches and fruit. Not one strong branch is left; she is stripped bare. This funeral song must be sung with sorrow."}

", "3": "Tell the people of Israel that on the tenth day of this month the head of each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for his family to eat. ", "4-5": "If any family is too small to eat the whole animal, they must share it with their next-door neighbors. Choose either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a one-year-old male that has nothing wrong with it. And it must be large enough for everyone to have some of the meat.", "6": "Each family must take care of its animal until the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, when the animals are to be killed. ", "7": "Some of the blood must be put on the two doorposts and above the door of each house where the animals are to be eaten. ", "8": "That night the animals are to be roasted and eaten, together with bitter herbs and thin bread made without yeast. ", "9": "Don't eat the meat raw or boiled. The entire animal, including its head, legs, and insides, must be roasted. ", "10": "Eat what you want that night, and the next morning burn whatever is left. ", "11": "When you eat the meal, be dressed and ready to travel. Have your sandals on, carry your walking stick in your hand, and eat quickly. This is the Passover Festival in honor of me, your Lord.", "12": "That same night I will pass through Egypt and kill the first-born son in every family and the first-born male of all animals. I am the Lord, and I will punish the gods of Egypt. ", "13": "The blood on the houses will show me where you live, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. Then you won't be bothered by the terrible disasters I will bring on Egypt.", "14": "Remember this day and celebrate it each year as a festival in my honor. ", "15": "For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast. And on the first of these seven days, you must remove all yeast from your homes. If you eat anything made with yeast during this festival, you will no longer be part of Israel. ", "16": "Meet together for worship on the first and seventh days of the festival. The only work you are allowed to do on either of these two days is that of preparing the bread.", "17": "Celebrate this Festival of Thin Bread as a way of remembering the day that I brought your families and tribes out of Egypt. And do this each year. ", "18": "Begin on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month by eating bread made without yeast. Then continue this celebration until the evening of the twenty-first day. ", "19": "During these seven days no yeast is allowed in anyone's home, whether they are native Israelites or not. If you are caught eating anything made with yeast, you will no longer be part of Israel. ", "20": "Stay away from yeast, no matter where you live. No one is allowed to eat anything made with yeast!", "21": "Moses called the leaders of Israel together and said: Each family is to pick out a sheep and kill it for Passover. ", "22": "Make a brush from a few small branches of a hyssop plant and dip the brush in the bowl that has the blood of the animal in it. Then brush some of the blood above the door and on the posts at each side of the door of your house. After this, everyone is to stay inside.", "23": "During that night the Lord will go through the country of Egypt and kill the first-born son in every Egyptian family. He will see where you have put the blood, and he will not come into your house. His angel that brings death will pass over and not kill your first-born sons.", "24-25": "After you have entered the country promised to you by the Lord, you and your children must continue to celebrate Passover each year. ", "26": "Your children will ask you, \u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201d ", "27": "And you will answer, \u201cThe Passover animal is killed to honor the Lord. We do these things because on that night long ago the Lord passed over the homes of our people in Egypt. He killed the first-born sons of the Egyptians, but he saved our children from death.\u201d After Moses finished speaking, the people of Israel knelt down and worshiped the Lord. ", "28": "Then they left and did what Moses and Aaron had told them to do.", "29": "At midnight the Lord killed the first-born son of every Egyptian family, from the son of the king[b] to the son of every prisoner in jail. He also killed the first-born male of every animal that belonged to the Egyptians.", "30": "That night the king, his officials, and everyone else in Egypt got up and started crying bitterly. In every Egyptian home, someone was dead.", "31": "During the night the king[c] sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, \u201cGet your people out of my country and leave us alone! Go and worship the Lord, as you have asked. ", "32": "Take your sheep, goats, and cattle, and get out. But ask your God to be kind to me.\u201d", "33": "The Egyptians did everything they could to get the Israelites to leave their country fast. They said, \u201cPlease hurry and leave. If you don't, we will all be dead.\u201d ", "34": "So the Israelites quickly made some bread dough and put it in pans. But they did not mix any yeast in the dough to make it rise. They wrapped cloth around the pans and carried them on their shoulders.", "35": "The Israelites had already done what Moses had told them to do. They had gone to their Egyptian neighbors and asked for gold and silver and for clothes. ", "36": "The Lord had made the Egyptians friendly toward the people of Israel, and they gave them whatever they asked for. In this way they carried away the wealth of the Egyptians when they left Egypt.", "37": "The Israelites walked from the city of Rameses to the city of Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand of them, not counting women and children. ", "38": "Many other people went with them as well, and there were also a lot of sheep, goats, and cattle. ", "39": "They left Egypt in such a hurry that they did not have time to prepare any food except the bread dough made without yeast. So they baked it and made thin bread.", "40-41": "The Lord's people left Egypt exactly four hundred thirty years after they had arrived. ", "42": "On that night the Lord kept watch for them, and on this same night each year Israel will always keep watch in honor of the Lord.", "43": "The Lord gave Moses and Aaron the following instructions for celebrating Passover: No one except Israelites may eat the Passover meal.", "44": "Your slaves may eat the meal if they have been circumcised, ", "45": "but no foreigners who work for you are allowed to have any.", "46": "The entire meal must be eaten inside, and no one may leave the house during the celebration. No bones of the Passover lamb may be broken. ", "47": "And all Israelites must take part in the meal.", "48": "If anyone who isn't an Israelite wants to celebrate Passover with you, every man and boy in that family must first be circumcised. Then they may join in the meal, just like native Israelites. No uncircumcised man or boy may eat the Passover meal! ", "49": "This law applies both to native Israelites and to those foreigners who live among you.", "50": "The Israelites obeyed everything the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron to tell them. ", "51": "And on that same day the Lord brought Israel's families and tribes out of Egypt."}

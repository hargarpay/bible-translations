I would go with my people, but they are so rebellious that I would destroy them before they get there.", "4-5": "Even before the Lord said these harsh things, he had told Moses, \u201cThese people really are rebellious, and I would kill them at once, if I went with them. But tell them to take off their fancy jewelry, then I'll decide what to do with them.\u201d So the people started mourning, ", "6": "and after leaving Mount Sinai,[a] they stopped wearing fancy jewelry.", "7": "Moses used to set up a tent far from camp.

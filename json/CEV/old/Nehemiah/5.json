", "5": "We are Jews just as they are, and our children are as good as theirs. But we still have to sell our children as slaves, and some of our daughters have already been raped. We are completely helpless; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us.\u201d", "6": "When I heard their complaints and their charges, I became very angry. ", "7": "So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials, \u201cHow can you charge your own people interest?\u201d Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders ", "8": "by saying, \u201cWe have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile. But here you are, selling more of them for us to buy back!\u201d The officials and leaders did not say a word, because they knew this was true.", "9": "I continued, \u201cWhat you have done is wrong!

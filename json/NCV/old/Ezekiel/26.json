{"1": "It was the eleventh year of our captivity, on the first day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me, saying: ", "2": "\u201cHuman, the city of Tyre has spoken against Jerusalem: 'The city that traded with the nations is destroyed. Now we can be the trading center. Since the city of Jerusalem is ruined, we can make money.' ", "3": "So this is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Tyre. I will bring many nations against you, like the sea beating its waves on your island shores. ", "4": "They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers. I will also scrape away her ruins and make her a bare rock. ", "5": "Tyre will be an island where fishermen dry their nets. I have spoken, says the Lord God. The nations will steal treasures from Tyre. ", "6": "Also, her villages on the shore across from the island will be destroyed by war. Then they will know that I am the Lord.", "7": "\u201cThis is what the Lord God says: I will bring a king from the north against Tyre. He is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the greatest king, with his horses, chariots, horsemen, and a great army. ", "8": "He will fight a battle and destroy your villages on the shore across from the island. He will set up devices to attack you. He will build a road of earth to the top of the walls. He will raise his shields against you. ", "9": "He will bring logs to pound through your city walls, and he will break down your towers with his iron bars. ", "10": "His horses will be so many that they will cover you with their dust. Your walls will shake at the noise of horsemen, wagons, and chariots. The king of Babylon will enter your city gates as men enter a city where the walls are broken through. ", "11": "The hoofs of his horses will run over your streets. He will kill your army with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall down to the ground. ", "12": "Also, his men will take away your riches and will steal the things you sell. They will break down your walls and destroy your nice houses. They will throw your stones, wood, and trash into the sea. ", "13": "So I will stop your songs; the music of your harps will not be heard anymore. ", "14": "I will make you a bare rock, and you will be a place for drying fishing nets. You will not be built again, because I, the Lord, have spoken, says the Lord God.", "15": "\u201cThis is what the Lord God says to Tyre: The people who live along the seacoast will shake with fear when they hear about your defeat. Those of you who are injured and dying will groan. ", "16": "Then all the leaders of the seacoast will get down from their thrones, take off their beautiful needlework clothes, and show how afraid they are. They will sit on the ground and tremble all the time. When they see you, they will be shocked. ", "17": "They will begin singing a funeral song about you and will say to you: 'Tyre, you famous city, you have been destroyed! You have lost your sea power! You and your people had great power on the seas. You made everyone around you afraid of you.", "18": "Now the people who live by the coast tremble, now that you have fallen. The islands of the sea are afraid because you have been defeated.'", "19": "\u201cThis is what the Lord God says: I will make you an empty city, like cities that have no people living in them. I will bring the deep ocean waters over you, and the Mediterranean Sea will cover you. ", "20": "At that time I will send you down to the place of the dead to join those who died long ago. I will make you live with the dead below the earth in places that are like old ruins. You will not come back from there or have any place in the world of the living again. ", "21": "Other people will be afraid of what happened to you, and it will be the end of you. People will look for you, but they will never find you again, says the Lord God.\u201d"}

It was a loud rumbling sound. ", "14": "So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I was unhappy and angry, and I felt the great power of the Lord. ", "15": "I came to the captives from Judah, who lived by the Kebar River at Tel Abib. I sat there seven days where these people lived, feeling shocked.", "16": "After seven days the Lord spoke his word to me again. He said, ", "17": "\u201cHuman, I now make you a watchman for Israel. Any time you hear a word from my mouth, warn them for me. ", "18": "When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' you must warn them so they may live. If you don't speak out to warn the wicked to stop their evil ways, they will die in their sin. But I will hold you responsible for their death.

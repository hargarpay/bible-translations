This is a sign to Israel.", "4": "\u201cThen lie down on your left side, and take the guilt of Israel on yourself. Their guilt will be on you for the number of days you lie on your left side.

So you will have the guilt of Israel's sin on you for three hundred ninety days.", "6": "\u201cAfter you have finished these three hundred ninety days, lie down a second time, on your right side. You will then have the guilt of Judah on you. I will give it to you for forty days, a day for each year of their sin. ", "7": "Then you will look toward Jerusalem, which is being attacked. With your arm bare, you will prophesy against Jerusalem.

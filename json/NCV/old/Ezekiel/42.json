The rooms were built in three stories like steps and had balconies. ", "4": "There was a path on the north side of the rooms, which was seventeen and one-half feet wide and one hundred seventy-five feet long. Doors led into the rooms from this path. ", "5": "The top rooms were narrower, because the balconies took more space from them. The rooms on the first and second stories of the building were wider. ", "6": "The rooms were on three stories. They did not have pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. So the top rooms were farther back than those on the first and second stories.

There the priests who go near the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings: the grain offerings, sin offerings, and the penalty offerings, because the place is holy. ", "14": "The priests who enter the Holy Place must leave their serving clothes there before they go into the outer courtyard, because these clothes are holy. After they put on other clothes, they may go to the part of the Temple area which is for the people.\u201d", "15": "When the man finished measuring inside the Temple area, he brought me out through the east gateway. He measured the area all around. ", "16": "The man measured the east side with the measuring stick; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick.

The Temple area had a wall all around it that was eight hundred seventy-five feet long and eight hundred seventy-five feet wide. It separated what was holy from that which was not holy."}

", "3": "You eat the milk curds, and you clothe yourselves with the wool. You kill the fat sheep, but you do not feed the flock. ", "4": "You have not made the weak strong. You have not healed the sick or put bandages on those that were hurt. You have not brought back those who strayed away or searched for the lost. But you have ruled the sheep with cruel force. ", "5": "The sheep were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for every wild animal. ", "6": "My flock wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered all over the face of the earth, and no one searched or looked for them.", "7": "\u201c'So, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says: ", "8": "As surely as I live, my flock has been caught and eaten by all the wild animals, because the flock has no shepherd. The shepherds did not search for my flock. No, they fed themselves instead of my flock. ", "9": "So, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. ", "10": "This is what the Lord God says: I am against the shepherds.

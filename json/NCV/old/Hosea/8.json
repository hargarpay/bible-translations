The Israelites have broken my agreement and have turned against my teachings.", "2": "They cry out to me, 'Our God, we in Israel know you!'", "3": "But Israel has rejected what is good, so the enemy will chase them.", "4": "They chose their own kings without asking my permission. They chose their own leaders, people I did not know. They made their silver and gold into idols, and for all this they will be destroyed.", "5": "I hate the calf-shaped idol of Israel! I am very angry with the people. How long will they remain unclean?", "6": "The idol is something a craftsman made; it is not God.

He remembers the evil they have done, and he will punish them for their sins. They will be slaves again as they were in Egypt.", "14": "Israel has forgotten their Maker and has built palaces; Judah has built many strong, walled cities. But I will send fire on their cities and destroy their strong buildings.\u201d"}

Make yourselves ready for the Lord's service, and make holy the Temple of the Lord, the God of your ancestors. Remove from the Temple everything that makes it impure. ", "6": "Our ancestors were unfaithful to God and did what the Lord said was wrong. They left the Lord and stopped worshiping at the Temple where he lives. They rejected him. ", "7": "They shut the doors of the porch of the Temple, and they let the fire go out in the lamps. They stopped burning incense and offering burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. ", "8": "So the Lord became very angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and he punished them. Other people are frightened and shocked by what he did to them. So they insult the people of Judah. You know these things are true. ", "9": "That is why our ancestors were killed in battle and our sons, daughters, and wives were taken captive. ", "10": "Now I, Hezekiah, have decided to make an agreement with the Lord, the God of Israel, so he will not be angry with us anymore. ", "11": "My sons, don't waste any more time.

Then they went into the Temple of the Lord to purify it. They obeyed the king's command that had come from the Lord. ", "16": "When the priests went into the Temple of the Lord to purify it, they took out all the unclean things they found in the Temple of the Lord and put them in the Temple courtyard. Then the Levites took these things out to the Kidron Valley. ", "17": "Beginning on the first day of the first month, they made the Temple holy for the Lord's service. On the eighth day of the month, they came to the porch of the Temple, and for eight more days they made the Temple of the Lord holy.

", "21": "They brought seven bulls, seven male sheep, seven lambs, and seven male goats. These animals were an offering to remove the sin of the people and the kingdom of Judah and to make the Temple ready for service to God. King Hezekiah commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these animals on the Lord's altar. ", "22": "So the priests killed the bulls and sprinkled their blood on the altar.

With the goats' blood they made an offering on the altar to remove the sins of the Israelites so they would belong to God. The king had said that the burnt offering and sin offering should be made for all Israel.", "25": "King Hezekiah put the Levites in the Temple of the Lord with cymbals, harps, and lyres, as David, Gad, and Nathan had commanded. (Gad was the king's seer, and Nathan was a prophet.) This command came from the Lord through his prophets. ", "26": "So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments of music, and the priests stood ready with their trumpets.", "27": "Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the singing to the Lord also began. The trumpets were blown, and the musical instruments of David king of Israel were played.

", "33": "The holy offerings totaled six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats. ", "34": "There were not enough priests to skin all the animals for the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them until the work was finished and other priests could be made holy. The Levites had been more careful to make themselves holy for the Lord's service than the priests. ", "35": "There were many burnt offerings along with the fat of fellowship offerings and drink offerings. So the service in the Temple of the Lord began again. ", "36": "And Hezekiah and the people were very happy that God had made it happen so quickly for his people."}

{"1": "Finally all the work Solomon did for the Temple of the Lord was finished. He brought in everything his father David had set apart for the Temple\u2014all the silver and gold and other articles. And he put everything in the treasuries of God's Temple.", "2": "Solomon called for the elders of Israel, the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the families to come to him in Jerusalem.

", "3": "So all the Israelites came together with the king during the festival in the seventh month.", "4": "When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites lifted up the Ark. ", "5": "They carried the Ark of the Agreement, the Meeting Tent, and the holy utensils in it; the priests and the Levites brought them up. ", "6": "King Solomon and all the Israelites gathered before the Ark of the Agreement and sacrificed so many sheep and bulls no one could count them.", "7": "Then the priests put the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord in its place inside the Most Holy Place in the Temple, under the wings of the golden creatures. ", "8": "The wings of these creatures were spread out over the place for the Ark, covering it and its carrying poles. ", "9": "The carrying poles were so long that anyone standing in the Holy Place in front of the Most Holy Place could see the ends of the poles. But no one could see them from outside the Holy Place. The poles are still there today. ", "10": "The only things inside the Ark were two stone tablets[a] that Moses had put in the Ark at Mount Sinai.

", "13": "Those who blew the trumpets and those who sang together sounded like one person as they praised and thanked the Lord.

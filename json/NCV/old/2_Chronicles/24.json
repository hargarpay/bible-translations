", "3": "Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash, and Joash had sons and daughters.", "4": "Later, Joash decided to repair the Temple of the Lord. ", "5": "He called the priests and the Levites together and said to them, \u201cGo to the towns of Judah and gather the money all the Israelites have to pay every year. Use it to repair the Temple of your God. Do this now.\u201d But the Levites did not hurry.", "6": "So King Joash called for Jehoiada the leading priest and said to him, \u201cWhy haven't you made the Levites bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax money that Moses, the Lord's servant, and the people of Israel used for the Holy Tent?\u201d", "7": "In the past the sons of wicked Athaliah had broken into the Temple of God and used its holy things for worshiping the Baal idols.", "8": "King Joash commanded that a box for contributions be made.

", "10": "All the officers and people were happy to bring their money, and they put it in the box until the box was full. ", "11": "When the Levites would take the box to the king's officers, they would see that it was full of money.

", "12": "King Joash and Jehoiada gave the money to the people who worked on the Temple of the Lord. And they hired stoneworkers and carpenters to repair the Temple of the Lord. They also hired people to work with iron and bronze to repair the Temple.", "13": "The people worked hard, and the work to repair the Temple went well. They rebuilt the Temple of God to be as it was before, but even stronger. ", "14": "When the workers finished, they brought the money that was left to King Joash and Jehoiada.

", "18": "The king and these leaders stopped worshiping in the Temple of the Lord, the God of their ancestors. Instead, they began to worship the Asherah idols and other idols. Because they did wrong, God was angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem. ", "19": "Even though the Lord sent prophets to the people to turn them back to him and even though the prophets warned them, they refused to listen.", "20": "Then the Spirit of God entered Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. Zechariah stood before the people and said, \u201cThis is what God says: 'Why do you disobey the Lord's commands? You will not be successful. Because you have left the Lord, he has also left you.'\u201d", "21": "But the king and his officers made plans against Zechariah.

They attacked Judah and Jerusalem, killed all the leaders of the people, and sent all the valuable things to their king in Damascus. ", "24": "The Aramean army came with only a small group of men, but the Lord handed over to them a very large army from Judah, because the people of Judah had left the Lord, the God of their ancestors. So Joash was punished. ", "25": "When the Arameans left, Joash was badly wounded. His own officers made plans against him because he had killed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. So they killed Joash in his own bed. He died and was buried in Jerusalem but not in the graves of the kings.", "26": "The officers who made plans against Joash were Jozabad and Jehozabad. Jozabad was the son of Shimeath, a woman from Ammon. And Jehozabad was the son of Shimrith, a woman from Moab.

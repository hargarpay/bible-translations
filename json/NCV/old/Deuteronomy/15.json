", "2": "This is how you must do it: Everyone who has loaned money must cancel the loan and not make a neighbor or relative pay it back. This is the Lord's time for canceling what people owe. ", "3": "You may make a foreigner pay what is owed to you, but you must not collect what another Israelite owes you.

", "8": "But give freely to them, and freely lend them whatever they need. ", "9": "Beware of evil thoughts. Don't think, \u201cThe seventh year is near, the year to cancel what people owe.\u201d You might be mean to the needy and not give them anything. Then they will complain to the Lord about you, and he will find you guilty of sin. ", "10": "Give freely to the poor person, and do not wish that you didn't have to give. The Lord your God will bless your work and everything you touch.

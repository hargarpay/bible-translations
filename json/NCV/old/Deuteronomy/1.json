They were in the desert area near Suph, between Paran and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.", "2": "(The trip from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea on the Mount Seir road takes eleven days.) ", "3": "Forty years after the Israelites had left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses told the people of Israel everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them. ", "4": "This was after the Lord had defeated Sihon and Og. Sihon was king of the Amorite people and lived in Heshbon. Og was king of Bashan and lived in Ashteroth and Edrei.", "5": "Now the Israelites were east of the Jordan River in the land of Moab, and there Moses began to explain what God had commanded. He said:", "6": "The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Sinai and said, \u201cYou have stayed long enough at this mountain. ", "7": "Get ready, and go to the mountain country of the Amorites, and to all the places around there\u2014the Jordan Valley, the mountains, the western hills, the southern area, the seacoast, the land of Canaan, and Lebanon. Go as far as the great river, the Euphrates. ", "8": "See, I have given you this land, so go in and take it for yourselves. The Lord promised it to your ancestors\u2014Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants.\u201d", "9": "At that time I said, \u201cI am not able to take care of you by myself.

I appointed commanders over a thousand people, over a hundred people, over fifty people, and over ten people and made them officers over your tribes. ", "16": "Then I told your leaders, \u201cListen to the arguments between your people. Judge fairly between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner.

We went through that large and terrible desert you saw, and then we came to Kadesh Barnea.

He brought us out of Egypt just to give us to the Amorites, who will destroy us. ", "28": "Where can we go now? The spies we sent have made us afraid, because they said, 'The people there are stronger and taller than we are. The cities are big, with walls up to the sky. And we saw the Anakites there!'\u201d", "29": "Then I said to you, \u201cDon't be frightened; don't be afraid of those people. ", "30": "The Lord your God will go ahead of you and fight for you as he did in Egypt; you saw him do it. ", "31": "And in the desert you saw how the Lord your God carried you, like one carries a child. And he has brought you safely all the way to this place.\u201d", "32": "But you still did not trust the Lord your God, even though ", "33": "he had always gone before you to find places for you to camp. In a fire at night and in a cloud during the day, he showed you which way to go.", "34": "When the Lord heard what you said, he was angry and made an oath, saying, ", "35": "\u201cI promised a good land to your ancestors, but none of you evil people will see it.

Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to take the land for their own.", "39": "\u201cYour little children that you said would be captured, who do not know right from wrong at this time, will go into the land. I will give the land to them, and they will take it for their own.

I will not be with you, and your enemies will defeat you.'\u201d", "43": "So I told you, but you would not listen. You would not obey the Lord's command. You were proud, so you went on up into the mountains, ", "44": "and the Amorites who lived in those mountains came out and fought you. They chased you like bees and defeated you from Edom to Hormah. ", "45": "So you came back and cried before the Lord, but the Lord did not listen to you; he refused to pay attention to you. ", "46": "So you stayed in Kadesh a long time."}

Why should I obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.\u201d", "3": "Then Aaron and Moses said, \u201cThe God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. If we don't do this, he may kill us with a disease or in war.\u201d", "4": "But the king said to them, \u201cMoses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Go back to your jobs!

", "7": "He said, \u201cDon't give the people straw to make bricks as you used to do. Let them gather their own straw. ", "8": "But they must still make the same number of bricks as they did before. Do not accept fewer. They have become lazy, and that is why they are asking me, 'Let us go to offer sacrifices to our God.'

But you must make as many bricks as you made before.\u201d ", "12": "So the people went everywhere in Egypt looking for dry stalks to use for straw.

They said, \u201cYou must make just as many bricks as you did when you were given straw.\u201d ", "14": "The king's slave masters had made the Israelite foremen responsible for the work the people did. The Egyptian slave masters beat these men and asked them, \u201cWhy aren't you making as many bricks as you made in the past?\u201d", "15": "Then the Israelite foremen went to the king and complained, \u201cWhy are you treating us, your servants, this way?

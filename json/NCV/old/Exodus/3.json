When Moses led the flock to the west side of the desert, he came to Sinai, the mountain of God. ", "2": "There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire coming out of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire, but it was not burning up. ", "3": "So he said, \u201cI will go closer to this strange thing. How can a bush continue burning without burning up?\u201d", "4": "When the Lord saw Moses was coming to look at the bush, God called to him from the bush, \u201cMoses, Moses!\u201d And Moses said, \u201cHere I am.\u201d", "5": "Then God said, \u201cDo not come any closer. Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground. ", "6": "I am the God of your ancestors\u2014the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\u201d Moses covered his face because he was afraid to look at God.", "7": "The Lord said, \u201cI have seen the troubles my people have suffered in Egypt, and I have heard their cries when the Egyptian slave masters hurt them. I am concerned about their pain, ", "8": "and I have come down to save them from the Egyptians. I will bring them out of that land and lead them to a good land with lots of room\u2014a fertile land. It is the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. ", "9": "I have heard the cries of the people of Israel, and I have seen the way the Egyptians have made life hard for them. ", "10": "So now I am sending you to the king of Egypt. Go! Bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt!\u201d", "11": "But Moses said to God, \u201cI am not a great man! How can I go to the king and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?\u201d", "12": "God said, \u201cI will be with you. This will be the proof that I am sending you: After you lead the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship me on this mountain.\u201d", "13": "Moses said to God, \u201cWhen I go to the Israelites, I will say to them, 'The God of your ancestors sent me to you.' What if the people say, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?\u201d", "14": "Then God said to Moses, \u201cI am who I am.[a] When you go to the people of Israel, tell them, 'I am sent me to you.'\u201d", "15": "God also said to Moses, \u201cThis is what you should tell the people: 'The Lord is the God of your ancestors\u2014the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He sent me to you.' This will always be my name, by which people from now on will know me.", "16": "\u201cGo and gather the elders and tell them this: 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me.

Let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.'", "19": "\u201cBut I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go. Only a great power will force him to let you go, ", "20": "so I will use my great power against Egypt. I will strike Egypt with all the miracles that will happen in that land. After I do that, he will let you go. ", "21": "I will cause the Egyptians to think well of the Israelites. So when you leave, they will give gifts to your people. ", "22": "Each woman should ask her Egyptian neighbor and any Egyptian woman living in her house for gifts\u2014silver, gold, and clothing. You should put those gifts on your children when you leave Egypt. In this way you will take with you the riches of the Egyptians.\u201d"}

They made the ten curtains of blue, purple, and red cloth, and they sewed designs of creatures with wings on the curtains. ", "9": "Each curtain was the same size\u2014forty-two feet long and six feet wide. ", "10": "Five of the curtains were fastened together to make one set, and the other five were fastened together to make another set. ", "11": "Then they made loops of blue cloth along the edge of the end curtain on the first set of five, and they did the same thing with the other set of five. ", "12": "There were fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the other curtain, with the loops opposite each other. ", "13": "They made fifty gold hooks to join the two curtains together so that the Holy Tent was joined together as one piece.", "14": "Then the workers made another tent of eleven curtains made of goat hair, to put over the Holy Tent.

", "23": "They made twenty frames for the south side of the Tent, ", "24": "and they made forty silver bases that went under the twenty frames. There were two bases for every frame\u2014one for each peg of each frame. ", "25": "They also made twenty frames for the north side of the Holy Tent ", "26": "and forty silver bases\u2014two to go under each frame.

Five crossbars held the frames together on one side of the Tent, ", "32": "and five held the frames together on the other side. Also, five crossbars held the frames together on the west end, at the rear of the Tent. ", "33": "They made the middle crossbar run along the entire length of each side and rear of the Tent. It was set halfway up the frames. ", "34": "They made gold rings on the sides of the frames to hold the crossbars, and they covered the frames and the crossbars with gold.", "35": "Then they made the curtain of blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen. A skilled craftsman sewed designs of creatures with wings on it. ", "36": "They made four posts of acacia wood for it and covered them with gold. Then they made gold hooks for the posts, as well as four silver bases in which to set the posts. ", "37": "For the entrance to the Tent, they made a curtain of blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen. A person who sewed well sewed designs on it. ", "38": "Then they made five posts and hooks for it. They covered the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, and they made five bronze bases for the posts."}

I will ruin the evil people, and I will remove human beings from the earth,\u201d says the Lord.", "4": "\u201cI will punish Judah and all the people living in Jerusalem. I will remove from this place all signs of Baal, the false priests, and the other priests.", "5": "I will destroy those who worship the stars from the roofs,[a] and those who worship and make promises by both the Lord and the god Molech,", "6": "and those who turned away from the Lord, and those who quit following the Lord and praying to him for direction.", "7": "Be silent before the Lord God, because the Lord's day for judging people is coming soon.

The Lord's anger will be like a fire that will burn up the whole world; suddenly he will bring an end, yes, an end to everyone on earth.\u201d"}

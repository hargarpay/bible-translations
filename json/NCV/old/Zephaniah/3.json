{"1": "How terrible for the wicked, stubborn city of Jerusalem, which hurts its own people.", "2": "It obeys no voice; it can't be taught to do right. It doesn't trust the Lord; it doesn't worship its God.", "3": "Its officers are like roaring lions. Its rulers are like hungry wolves that attack in the evening, and in the morning nothing is left of those they attacked.", "4": "Its prophets are proud; they are people who cannot be trusted. Its priests don't respect holy things; they break God's teachings.", "5": "But the Lord is good, and he is there in that city. He does no wrong. Every morning he governs the people fairly; every day he can be trusted. But evil people are not ashamed of what they do.", "6": "\u201cI have destroyed nations; their towers were ruined. I made their streets empty so no one goes there anymore. Their cities are ruined; no one lives there at all.", "7": "I said, 'Surely now Jerusalem will respect me and will accept my teaching.' Then the place where they lived would not be destroyed, and I would not have to punish them. But they were still eager to do evil in everything they did.", "8": "Just wait,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cSomeday I will stand up as a witness. I have decided that I will gather nations and assemble kingdoms. I will pour out my anger on them, all my strong anger. My anger will be like fire that will burn up the whole world.", "9": "\u201cThen I will give the people of all nations pure speech so that all of them will speak the name of the Lord and worship me together.", "10": "People will come from where the Nile River begins; my scattered people will come with gifts for me.", "11": "Then Jerusalem will not be ashamed of the wrongs done against me, because I will remove from this city those who like to brag; there will never be any more proud people on my holy mountain in Jerusalem.", "12": "But I will leave in the city the humble and those who are not proud, and they will trust in the Lord.", "13": "Those who are left alive in Israel won't do wrong or tell lies; they won't trick people with their words. They will eat and lie down with no one to make them afraid.\u201d", "14": "Sing, Jerusalem. Israel, shout for joy! Jerusalem, be happy and rejoice with all your heart.", "15": "The Lord has stopped punishing you; he has sent your enemies away. The King of Israel, the Lord, is with you; you will never again be afraid of being harmed.", "16": "On that day Jerusalem will be told, \u201cDon't be afraid, city of Jerusalem. Don't give up.", "17": "The Lord your God is with you; the mighty One will save you. He will rejoice over you. You will rest in his love; he will sing and be joyful about you.\u201d", "18": "\u201cI will take away the sadness planned for you, which would have made you very ashamed.", "19": "At that time I will punish all those who harmed you. I will save my people who cannot walk and gather my people who have been thrown out. I will give them praise and honor in every place where they were shamed.", "20": "At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you back home. I will give you honor and praise from people everywhere when I make things go well again for you, as you will see with your own eyes,\u201d says the Lord."}

", "3": "Then the Lord spoke his word to me a second time: ", "4": "\u201cTake the belt you bought and are wearing, and go to Perath. Hide the belt there in a crack in the rocks.\u201d ", "5": "So I went to Perath and hid the belt there, just as the Lord told me.", "6": "Many days later the Lord said to me, \u201cNow go to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.\u201d ", "7": "So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from where I had hidden it. But now it was ruined; it was good for nothing.", "8": "Then the Lord spoke his word to me. ", "9": "This is what the Lord said: \u201cIn the same way I will ruin the pride of the people of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. ", "10": "These evil people refuse to listen to my warnings. They stubbornly do only what they want to do, and they follow other gods to serve and worship them. So they will become like this linen belt\u2014good for nothing. ", "11": "As a belt is wrapped tightly around a person's waist, I wrapped the families of Israel and Judah around me,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cI did that so they would be my people and bring fame, praise, and honor to me.

Don't be too proud, because the Lord has spoken to you.", "16": "Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings darkness and before you slip and fall on the dark hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it into thick darkness; he will change it into deep gloom.", "17": "If you don't listen to him, I will cry secretly because of your pride. I will cry painfully, and my eyes will overflow with tears, because the Lord's people will be captured.", "18": "Tell this to the king and the queen mother: \u201cCome down from your thrones, because your beautiful crowns have fallen from your heads.\u201d", "19": "The cities of southern Judah are locked up, and no one can open them.

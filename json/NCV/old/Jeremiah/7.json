Then I will let you live in this place. ", "4": "Don't trust the lies of people who say, \u201cThis is the Temple of the Lord. This is the Temple of the Lord. This is the Temple of the Lord!\u201d ", "5": "You must change your lives and do what is right. Be fair to each other. ", "6": "You must not be hard on strangers, orphans, and widows.

Do you think you can say, \u201cWe are safe!\u201d when you do all these hateful things? ", "11": "This place where I have chosen to be worshiped is nothing more to you than a hideout for robbers.

I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen to me. I called you, but you did not answer. ", "14": "So I will destroy the place where I have chosen to be worshiped in Jerusalem.

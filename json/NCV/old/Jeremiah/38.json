But everyone who surrenders to the Babylonian army will live; they will escape with their lives and live.' ", "3": "And this is what the Lord says: 'This city of Jerusalem will surely be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon. He will capture this city!'\u201d", "4": "Then the officers said to the king, \u201cJeremiah must be put to death! He is discouraging the soldiers who are still in the city, and all the people, by what he is saying to them. He does not want good to happen to us; he wants to ruin us.\u201d", "5": "King Zedekiah said to them, \u201cJeremiah is in your control. I cannot do anything to stop you.\u201d", "6": "So the officers took Jeremiah and put him into the well of Malkijah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guards. The officers used ropes to lower Jeremiah into the well, which did not have any water in it, only mud.

Ebed-Melech said to him, ", "9": "\u201cMy master and king, these rulers have acted in an evil way. They have treated Jeremiah the prophet badly.

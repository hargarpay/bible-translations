And I will give all the people of Judah to the king of Babylon, who will take them away as captives to Babylon and then will kill them with swords.

You are stronger than I am, so you won. I have become a joke; everyone makes fun of me all day long.", "8": "Every time I speak, I shout. I am always shouting about violence and destruction.

Disaster is coming from the north; terrible destruction is coming to you.", "2": "Jerusalem, I will destroy you, you who are fragile and gentle.", "3": "Shepherds with their flocks will come against Jerusalem. They will set up their tents all around her, each shepherd taking care of his own section.\u201d", "4": "They say, \u201cGet ready to fight against Jerusalem! Get up! We will attack at noon! But it is already getting late; the evening shadows are growing long.", "5": "So get up! We will attack at night. We will destroy the strong towers of Jerusalem!\u201d", "6": "This is what the Lord All-Powerful says: \u201cCut down the trees around Jerusalem, and build an attack ramp to the top of its walls. This city must be punished. Inside it is nothing but slavery.", "7": "Jerusalem pours out her evil as a well pours out its water. The sounds of violence and destruction are heard within her. I can see the sickness and hurts of Jerusalem.", "8": "Listen to this warning, Jerusalem, or I will turn my back on you and make your land an empty desert where no one can live.\u201d", "9": "This is what the Lord All-Powerful says: \u201cGather the few people of Israel who are left alive, as you would gather the last grapes on a grapevine.

Watch what I will do to the people of Judah.", "19": "Hear this, people of the earth: I am going to bring disaster to the people of Judah because of the evil they plan. They have not listened to my messages and have rejected my teachings.", "20": "Why do you bring me offerings of incense from the land of Sheba? Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway land?

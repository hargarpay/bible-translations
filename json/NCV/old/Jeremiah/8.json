", "2": "The bones will be spread on the ground under the sun, moon, and stars that the people loved and served and went after and searched for and worshiped. No one will gather up the bones and bury them. So they will be like dung thrown on the ground. ", "3": "I will force the people of Judah to leave their homes and their land. Those of this evil family who are not dead will wish they were, says the Lord All-Powerful.'", "4": "\u201cSay to the people of Judah: 'This is what the Lord says: When people fall down, don't they get up again? And when someone goes the wrong way, doesn't he turn back?", "5": "Why, then, have the people of Jerusalem gone the wrong way and not turned back? They believe their own lies and refuse to turn around and come back.", "6": "I have listened to them very carefully, but they do not say what is right. They do not feel sorry about their wicked ways, saying, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Each person goes his own way, like a horse charging into a battle.", "7": "Even the birds in the sky know the right times to do things.

They will be ashamed. They will be shocked and trapped.", "10": "So I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. Everyone, from the least important to the greatest, is greedy for money. Even the prophets and priests all tell lies.", "11": "They tried to heal my people's serious injuries as if they were small wounds. They said, \u201cIt's all right, it's all right.\u201d But really, it is not all right.", "12": "They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act, but they are not ashamed at all. They don't even know how to blush about their sins. So they will fall, along with everyone else. They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them, says the Lord.", "13": "\u201c'I will take away their crops, says the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree.

I am sending poisonous snakes to attack you. These snakes cannot be charmed, and they will bite you,\u201d says the Lord.", "18": "God, you are my comfort when I am very sad and when I am afraid.", "19": "Listen to the sound of my people.

I have called you by name, and you are mine.", "2": "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you cross rivers, you will not drown. When you walk through fire, you will not be burned, nor will the flames hurt you.", "3": "This is because I, the Lord, am your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I gave Egypt to pay for you, and I gave Cush and Seba to make you mine.", "4": "Because you are precious to me, because I give you honor and love you, I will give other people in your place; I will give other nations to save your life.", "5": "Don't be afraid, because I am with you.

It was not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses, and I am God,\u201d says the Lord.", "13": "\u201cI have always been God. No one can save people from my power; when I do something, no one can change it.\u201d", "14": "This is what the Lord, who saves you, the Holy One of Israel, says: \u201cI will send armies to Babylon for you, and I will knock down all its locked gates.

Instead you have weighed me down with your many sins; you have made me tired of your many wrongs.", "25": "\u201cI, I am the One who erases all your sins, for my sake; I will not remember your sins.", "26": "But you should remind me. Let's meet and decide what is right.

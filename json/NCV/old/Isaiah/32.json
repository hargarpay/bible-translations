{"1": "A king will rule in a way that brings justice, and leaders will make fair decisions.", "2": "Then each ruler will be like a shelter from the wind, like a safe place in a storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like a cool shadow from a large rock in a hot land.", "3": "People will look to the king for help, and they will truly listen to what he says.", "4": "People who are now worried will be able to understand. Those who cannot speak clearly now will then be able to speak clearly and quickly.", "5": "Fools will not be called great, and people will not respect the wicked.", "6": "A fool says foolish things, and in his mind he plans evil. A fool does things that are wicked, and he says wrong things about the Lord. A fool does not feed the hungry or let thirsty people drink water.", "7": "The wicked person uses evil like a tool. He plans ways to take everything from the poor. He destroys the poor with lies, even when the poor person is in the right.", "8": "But a good leader plans to do good, and those good things make him a good leader.", "9": "You women who are calm now, stand up and listen to me. You women who feel safe now, hear what I say.", "10": "You women feel safe now, but after one year you will be afraid. There will be no grape harvest and no summer fruit to gather.", "11": "Women, you are calm now, but you should shake with fear. Women, you feel safe now, but you should tremble. Take off your nice clothes and put rough cloth around your waist to show your sadness.", "12": "Beat your breasts in grief, because the fields that were pleasant are now empty. Cry, because the vines that once had fruit now have no more grapes.", "13": "Cry for the land of my people, in which only thorns and weeds now grow. Cry for the city that once was happy and for all the houses that once were filled with joy.", "14": "The palace will be empty; people will leave the noisy city. Strong cities and towers will be empty. Wild donkeys will love to live there, and sheep will go there to eat.", "15": "This will continue until God pours his Spirit from above upon us. Then the desert will be like a fertile field and the fertile field like a forest.", "16": "Justice will be found even in the desert, and fairness will be found in the fertile fields.", "17": "That fairness will bring peace, and it will bring calm and safety forever.", "18": "My people will live in peaceful places and in safe homes and in calm places of rest.", "19": "Hail will destroy the forest, and the city will be completely destroyed.", "20": "But you will be happy as you plant seeds near every stream and as you let your cattle and donkeys wander freely."}

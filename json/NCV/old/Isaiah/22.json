Kir will prepare their shields.", "7": "Your nicest valleys will be filled with chariots. Horsemen will be ordered to guard the gates of the city.", "8": "The walls protecting Judah will fall. At that time the people of Jerusalem depended on the weapons kept at the Palace of the Forest.", "9": "You saw that the walls of Jerusalem had many cracks that needed repairing.

The earth and all the people in it should listen, the world and everything in it.", "2": "The Lord is angry with all the nations; he is angry with their armies. He will destroy them and kill them all.", "3": "Their bodies will be thrown outside. The stink will rise from the bodies, and the blood will flow down the mountains.", "4": "The sun, moon, and stars will dissolve, and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll. The stars will fall like dead leaves from a vine or dried-up figs from a fig tree.", "5": "The Lord's sword in the sky is covered with blood. It will cut through Edom and destroy those people as an offering to the Lord.", "6": "The Lord's sword will be covered with blood; it will be covered with fat, with the blood from lambs and goats, with the fat from the kidneys of sheep. This is because the Lord decided there will be a sacrifice in Bozrah and much killing in Edom.", "7": "The oxen will be killed, and the cattle and the strong bulls. The land will be filled with their blood, and the dirt will be covered with their fat.", "8": "The Lord has chosen a time for punishment.

It will be a home for wild dogs and a place for owls to live.", "14": "Desert animals will live with the hyenas, and wild goats will call to their friends. Night animals will live there and find a place of rest.", "15": "Owls will nest there and lay eggs. When they hatch open, the owls will gather their young under their wings. Hawks will gather with their own kind.", "16": "Look at the Lord's scroll and read what is written there: None of these will be missing; none will be without its mate. God has given the command, so his Spirit will gather them together.", "17": "God has divided the land among them, and he has given them each their portion. So they will own that land forever and will live there year after year."}

{"1": "Who would have believed what we heard? Who saw the Lord's power in this?", "2": "He grew up like a small plant before the Lord, like a root growing in a dry land. He had no special beauty or form to make us notice him; there was nothing in his appearance to make us desire him.", "3": "He was hated and rejected by people. He had much pain and suffering. People would not even look at him. He was hated, and we didn't even notice him.", "4": "But he took our suffering on him and felt our pain for us. We saw his suffering and thought God was punishing him.", "5": "But he was wounded for the wrong we did; he was crushed for the evil we did. The punishment, which made us well, was given to him, and we are healed because of his wounds.", "6": "We all have wandered away like sheep; each of us has gone his own way. But the Lord has put on him the punishment for all the evil we have done.", "7": "He was beaten down and punished, but he didn't say a word. He was like a lamb being led to be killed. He was quiet, as a sheep is quiet while its wool is being cut; he never opened his mouth.", "8": "Men took him away roughly and unfairly. He died without children to continue his family. He was put to death; he was punished for the sins of my people.", "9": "He was buried with wicked men, and he died with the rich. He had done nothing wrong, and he had never lied.", "10": "But it was the Lord who decided to crush him and make him suffer. The Lord made his life a penalty offering, but he will still see his descendants and live a long life. He will complete the things the Lord wants him to do.", "11": "\u201cAfter his soul suffers many things, he will see life and be satisfied. My good servant will make many people right with God; he will carry away their sins.", "12": "For this reason I will make him a great man among people, and he will share in all things with those who are strong. He willingly gave his life and was treated like a criminal. But he carried away the sins of many people and asked forgiveness for those who sinned.\u201d"}

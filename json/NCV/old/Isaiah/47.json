You will no longer be called tender or beautiful.", "2": "You must use large stones to grind grain into flour. Remove your veil and your nice skirts. Uncover your legs and cross the rivers.", "3": "People will see your nakedness; they will see your shame. I will punish you; I will punish every one of you.\u201d", "4": "Our Savior is named the Lord All-Powerful; he is the Holy One of Israel.", "5": "\u201cBabylon, sit in darkness and say nothing. You will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms.", "6": "I was angry with my people, so I rejected those who belonged to me. I gave them to you, but you showed them no mercy. You even made the old people work very hard.", "7": "You said, 'I will live forever as the queen.' But you did not think about these things or consider what would happen.", "8": "\u201cNow, listen, you lover of pleasure. You think you are safe. You tell yourself, 'I am the only important person. I will never be a widow or lose my children.'", "9": "Two things will happen to you suddenly, in a single day. You will lose your children and your husband. These things will truly happen to you, in spite of all your magic, in spite of your powerful tricks.", "10": "You do evil things, but you feel safe and say, 'No one sees what I do.'

Disaster will fall on you, and you will not be able to keep it away. You will be destroyed quickly; you will not even see it coming.", "12": "\u201cKeep on using your tricks and doing all your magic that you have used since you were young. Maybe they will help you; maybe you will be able to scare someone.", "13": "You are tired of the advice you have received. So let those who study the sky\u2014 those who tell the future by looking at the stars and the new moons\u2014 let them save you from what is about to happen to you.", "14": "But they are like straw; fire will quickly burn them up. They cannot save themselves from the power of the fire.

Everyone will go his own way, and there will be no one left to save you.\u201d"}

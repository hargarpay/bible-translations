All things are here because I made them,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cThese are the people I am pleased with: those who are not proud or stubborn and who fear my word.", "3": "But those people who kill bulls as a sacrifice to me are like those who kill people. Those who kill sheep as a sacrifice are like those who break the necks of dogs. Those who give me grain offerings are like those who offer me the blood of pigs.[a] Those who burn incense are like those who worship idols. These people choose their own ways, not mine, and they love the terrible things they do.", "4": "So I will choose their punishments, and I will punish them with what they fear most. This is because I called to them, but they did not listen. I spoke to them, but they did not hear me. They did things I said were evil; they chose to do things I did not like.\u201d", "5": "You people who obey the words of the Lord, listen to what he says: \u201cYour brothers hated you and turned against you because you followed me.

In the same way no one ever saw a country begin in one day; no one has ever heard of a new nation beginning in one moment. But Jerusalem will give birth to her children just as soon as she feels the birth pains.", "9": "In the same way I will not cause pain without allowing something new to be born,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cIf I cause you the pain, I will not stop you from giving birth to your new nation,\u201d says your God.", "10": "\u201cJerusalem, rejoice. All you people who love Jerusalem, be happy. Those of you who felt sad for Jerusalem should now feel happy with her.", "11": "You will take comfort from her and be satisfied, as a child is nursed by its mother. You will receive her good things and enjoy her wealth.\u201d", "12": "This is what the Lord says: \u201cI will give her peace that will flow to her like a river. The wealth of the nations will come to her like a river overflowing its banks.

", "20": "And they will bring all your fellow Israelites from all nations to my holy mountain in Jerusalem. Your fellow Israelites will come on horses, donkeys, and camels and in chariots and wagons. They will be like the grain offerings that the people bring in clean containers to the Temple,\u201d says the Lord.

Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d", "5": "Joab went into the king's house and said, \u201cToday you have shamed all your men. They saved your life and the lives of your sons, daughters, wives, and slave women. ", "6": "You have shamed them because you love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. Today you have made it clear that your commanders and men mean nothing to you. What if Absalom had lived and all of us were dead? I can see you would be pleased.

We should make David the king again.\u201d", "11": "King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, that said, \u201cSpeak to the elders of Judah. Say, 'Even in my house I have heard what all the Israelites are saying. So why are you the last tribe to bring the king back to his palace? ", "12": "You are my brothers, my own family. Why are you the last tribe to bring back the king?' ", "13": "And say to Amasa, 'You are part of my own family. May God punish me terribly if I don't make you commander of the army in Joab's place!'\u201d", "14": "David touched the hearts of all the people of Judah at once. They sent a message to the king that said, \u201cReturn with all your men.\u201d ", "15": "Then the king returned as far as the Jordan River. The men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and to bring him across the Jordan.", "16": "Shimei son of Gera, a Benjaminite who lived in Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. ", "17": "With Shimei came a thousand Benjaminites. Ziba, the servant from Saul's family, also came, bringing his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him. They all hurried to the Jordan River to meet the king. ", "18": "The people went across the Jordan to help bring the king's family back to Judah and to do whatever the king wanted. As the king was crossing the river, Shimei son of Gera came to him and bowed facedown on the ground in front of the king. ", "19": "He said to the king, \u201cMy master, don't hold me guilty. Don't remember the wrong I did when you left Jerusalem! Don't hold it against me. ", "20": "I know I have sinned.

I said to Ziba, 'I am crippled, so saddle a donkey. Then I will ride it so I can go with the king.' ", "27": "But he lied about me to you. You, my master and king, are like an angel from God. Do what you think is good. ", "28": "You could have killed all my grandfather's family. Instead, you put me with those people who eat at your own table. So I don't have a right to ask anything more from the king!\u201d", "29": "The king said to him, \u201cDon't say anything more. I have decided that you and Ziba will divide the land.\u201d", "30": "Mephibosheth said to the king, \u201cLet Ziba take all the land now that my master the king has arrived safely home.\u201d", "31": "Barzillai of Gilead came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan River with the king.

Come with me to Jerusalem, and I will take care of you.\u201d", "34": "But Barzillai answered the king, \u201cDo you know how old I am? Do you think I can go with you to Jerusalem? ", "35": "I am eighty years old! I am too old to taste what I eat or drink. I am too old to hear the voices of men and women singers. Why should you be bothered with me? ", "36": "I am not worthy of a reward from you, but I will cross the Jordan River with you. ", "37": "Then let me go back so I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and mother. But here is Kimham, your servant. Let him go with you, my master and king. Do with him whatever you want.\u201d", "38": "The king answered, \u201cKimham will go with me. I will do for him anything you wish, and I will do anything for you that you wish.\u201d ", "39": "The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him.

Why did they bring you and your family across the Jordan River with your men?\u201d", "42": "All the people of Judah answered the Israelites, \u201cWe did this because the king is our close relative. Why are you angry about it? We have not eaten food at the king's expense or taken anything for ourselves!\u201d", "43": "The Israelites answered the people of Judah, \u201cWe have ten tribes in the kingdom, so we have more right to David than you do! But you ignored us! We were the first ones to talk about bringing our king back!\u201d But the people of Judah spoke even more unkindly than the people of Israel."}

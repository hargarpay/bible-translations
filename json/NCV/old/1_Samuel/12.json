I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader since I was young. ", "3": "Here I am. If I have done anything wrong, you must testify against me before the Lord and his appointed king. Did I steal anyone's ox or donkey? Did I hurt or cheat anyone? Did I ever secretly accept money to pretend not to see something wrong? If I did any of these things, I will make it right.\u201d", "4": "The Israelites answered, \u201cYou have not cheated us, or hurt us, or taken anything unfairly from anyone.\u201d", "5": "Samuel said to them, \u201cThe Lord is a witness to what you have said. His appointed king is also a witness today that you did not find anything wrong in me.\u201d \u201cHe is our witness,\u201d they said.", "6": "Then Samuel said to the people, \u201cIt is the Lord who chose Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors out of Egypt. ", "7": "Now, stand there, and I will remind you of all the good things the Lord did for you and your ancestors.", "8": "\u201cAfter Jacob entered Egypt, his descendants cried to the Lord for help. So the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who took your ancestors out of Egypt and brought them to live in this place.", "9": "\u201cBut they forgot the Lord their God. So he handed them over as slaves to Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and as slaves to the Philistines and the king of Moab. They all fought against your ancestors. ", "10": "Then your ancestors cried to the Lord and said, 'We have sinned. We have left the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now save us from our enemies, and we will serve you.' ", "11": "So the Lord sent Gideon,[a] Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel. He saved you from your enemies around you, and you lived in safety. ", "12": "But when you saw Nahash king of the Ammonites coming against you, you said, 'No! We want a king to rule over us!'\u2014even though the Lord your God was your king. ", "13": "Now here is the king you chose, the one you asked for. The Lord has put him over you. ", "14": "You must honor the Lord and serve him. You must obey his word and not turn against his commands. Both you and the king ruling over you must follow the Lord your God. If you do, it will be well with you.

So the people were very afraid of the Lord and Samuel. ", "19": "They said to Samuel, \u201cPray to the Lord your God for us, your servants! Don't let us die! We've added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king.\u201d", "20": "Samuel answered, \u201cDon't be afraid. It's true that you did wrong, but don't turn away from the Lord. Serve the Lord with all your heart. ", "21": "Idols are of no use, so don't worship them. They can't help you or save you. They are useless! ", "22": "For his own sake, the Lord won't leave his people. Instead, he was pleased to make you his own people. ", "23": "I will surely not stop praying for you, because that would be sinning against the Lord. I will teach you what is good and right. ", "24": "You must honor the Lord and truly serve him with all your heart. Remember the wonderful things he did for you! ", "25": "But if you are stubborn and do evil, he will sweep you and your king away.\u201d"}

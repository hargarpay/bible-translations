Saul sent the other men in the army back home.", "3": "Jonathan attacked the Philistine camp in Geba, and the other Philistines heard about it. Saul said, \u201cLet the Hebrews hear what happened.\u201d So he told the men to blow trumpets through all the land of Israel. ", "4": "All the Israelites heard the news. The men said, \u201cSaul has defeated the Philistine camp. Now the Philistines will really hate us!\u201d Then the Israelites were called to join Saul at Gilgal.", "5": "The Philistines gathered to fight Israel with three thousand[b] chariots and six thousand men to ride in them. Their soldiers were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. The Philistines went and camped at Micmash, which is east of Beth Aven. ", "6": "When the Israelites saw that they were in trouble, they went to hide in caves and bushes, among the rocks, and in pits and wells.

If you had obeyed him, the Lord would have made your kingdom continue in Israel always, ", "14": "but now your kingdom will not continue. The Lord has looked for the kind of man he wants. He has appointed him to rule his people, because you haven't obeyed his command.\u201d", "15": "Then Samuel left Gilgal and went to Gibeah in Benjamin.

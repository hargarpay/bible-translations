", "6": "He defeated Samaria in the ninth year Hoshea was king, and he took the Israelites away to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.", "7": "All these things happened because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God. He had brought them out of Egypt and had rescued them from the power of the king of Egypt, but the Israelites had honored other gods. ", "8": "They lived like the nations the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of them. They lived as their evil kings had shown them, ", "9": "secretly sinning against the Lord their God. They built places to worship gods in all their cities, from the watchtower to the strong, walled city. ", "10": "They put up stone pillars to gods and Asherah idols on every high hill and under every green tree. ", "11": "The Israelites burned incense everywhere gods were worshiped, just as the nations who lived there before them had done, whom the Lord had forced out of the land.

Only the tribe of Judah was left.", "19": "But even Judah did not obey the commands of the Lord their God.

These people took over Samaria and lived in the cities. ", "25": "At first they did not worship the Lord, so he sent lions among them which killed some of them. ", "26": "The king of Assyria was told, \u201cYou sent foreigners into the cities of Samaria who do not know the law of the god of the land. This is why he has sent lions among them. The lions are killing them because they don't know what the god wants.\u201d", "27": "Then the king of Assyria commanded, \u201cSend back one of the priests you took away. Let him live there and teach the people what the god wants.\u201d ", "28": "So one of the priests who had been carried away from Samaria returned to live in Bethel. And he taught the people how to honor the Lord.", "29": "But each nation made gods of its own and put them in the cities where they lived and in the temples where gods were worshiped.

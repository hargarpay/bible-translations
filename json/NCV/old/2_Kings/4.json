{"1": "The wife of a man from the groups of prophets said to Elisha, \u201cYour servant, my husband, is dead. You know he honored the Lord. But now the man he owes money to is coming to take my two boys as his slaves!\u201d", "2": "Elisha answered, \u201cHow can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?\u201d The woman said, \u201cI don't have anything there except a pot of oil.\u201d", "3": "Then Elisha said, \u201cGo and get empty jars from all your neighbors. Don't ask for just a few. ", "4": "Then go into your house and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and set the full ones aside.\u201d", "5": "So she left Elisha and shut the door behind her and her sons. As they brought the jars to her, she poured out the oil. ", "6": "When the jars were all full, she said to her son, \u201cBring me another jar.\u201d But he said, \u201cThere are no more jars.\u201d Then the oil stopped flowing.", "7": "She went and told Elisha. And the prophet said to her, \u201cGo, sell the oil and pay what you owe. You and your sons can live on what is left.\u201d", "8": "One day Elisha went to Shunem, where an important woman lived. She begged Elisha to stay and eat. So every time Elisha passed by, he stopped there to eat. ", "9": "The woman said to her husband, \u201cI know that this is a holy man of God who passes by our house all the time. ", "10": "Let's make a small room on the roof[a] and put a bed in the room for him. We can put a table, a chair, and a lampstand there. Then when he comes by, he can stay there.\u201d", "11": "One day Elisha came to the woman's house. After he went to his room and rested, ", "12": "he said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cCall the Shunammite woman.\u201d When the servant had called her, she stood in front of him. ", "13": "Elisha had told his servant, \u201cNow say to her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak to the king or the commander of the army for you?'\u201d She answered, \u201cI live among my own people.\u201d", "14": "Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cBut what can we do for her?\u201d He answered, \u201cShe has no son, and her husband is old.\u201d", "15": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cCall her.\u201d When he called her, she stood in the doorway. ", "16": "Then Elisha said, \u201cAbout this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.\u201d The woman said, \u201cNo, master, man of God, don't lie to me, your servant!\u201d", "17": "But the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son at that time the next year, just as Elisha had told her.", "18": "The boy grew up and one day went out to his father, who was with the grain harvesters. ", "19": "The boy said to his father, \u201cMy head! My head!\u201d The father said to his servant, \u201cTake him to his mother!\u201d ", "20": "The servant took him to his mother, and he lay on his mother's lap until noon. Then he died. ", "21": "So she took him up and laid him on Elisha's bed. Then she shut the door and left.", "22": "She called to her husband, \u201cSend me one of the servants and one of the donkeys. Then I can go quickly to the man of God and return.\u201d", "23": "The husband said, \u201cWhy do you want to go to him today? It isn't the New Moon or the Sabbath day.\u201d She said, \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d", "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \u201cLead on. Don't slow down for me unless I tell you.\u201d ", "25": "So she went to Elisha, the man of God, at Mount Carmel. When he saw her coming from far away, he said to his servant Gehazi, \u201cLook, there's the Shunammite woman! ", "26": "Run to meet her and ask, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the boy all right?'\u201d She answered, \u201cEverything is all right.\u201d", "27": "Then she came to Elisha at the hill and grabbed his feet. Gehazi came near to pull her away, but Elisha said to him, \u201cLeave her alone. She's very upset, and the Lord has not told me about it. He has hidden it from me.\u201d", "28": "She said, \u201cMaster, did I ask you for a son? Didn't I tell you not to lie to me?\u201d", "29": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, \u201cGet ready. Take my walking stick in your hand and go quickly. If you meet anyone, don't say hello. If anyone greets you, don't respond. Lay my walking stick on the boy's face.\u201d", "30": "The boy's mother said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I won't leave you!\u201d So Elisha got up and followed her.", "31": "Gehazi went on ahead and laid the walking stick on the boy's face, but the boy did not talk or move. Then Gehazi went back to meet Elisha. \u201cThe boy has not awakened,\u201d he said.", "32": "When Elisha came into the house, the boy was lying dead on his bed. ", "33": "Elisha entered the room and shut the door, so only he and the boy were in the room. Then he prayed to the Lord. ", "34": "He went to the bed and lay on the boy, putting his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on the boy's eyes, and his hands on the boy's hands. He stretched himself out on top of the boy. Soon the boy's skin became warm. ", "35": "Elisha turned away and walked around the room. Then he went back and put himself on the boy again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.", "36": "Elisha called Gehazi and said, \u201cCall the Shunammite!\u201d So he did. When she came, Elisha said, \u201cPick up your son.\u201d ", "37": "She came in and fell at Elisha's feet, bowing facedown to the floor. Then she picked up her son and went out.", "38": "When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a shortage of food in the land. While the groups of prophets were sitting in front of him, he said to his servant, \u201cPut the large pot on the fire, and boil some stew for these men.\u201d", "39": "One of them went out into the field to gather plants. Finding a wild vine, he picked fruit from the vine and filled his robe with it. Then he came and cut up the fruit into the pot. But they didn't know what kind of fruit it was. ", "40": "They poured out the stew for the others to eat. When they began to eat it, they shouted, \u201cMan of God, there's death in the pot!\u201d And they could not eat it.", "41": "Elisha told them to bring some flour. He threw it into the pot and said, \u201cPour it out for the people to eat.\u201d Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.", "42": "A man from Baal Shalishah came to Elisha, bringing him twenty loaves of barley bread from the first harvest. He also brought fresh grain in his sack. Elisha said, \u201cGive it to the people to eat.\u201d", "43": "Elisha's servant asked, \u201cHow can I feed a hundred people with so little?\u201d \u201cGive the bread to the people to eat,\u201d Elisha said. \u201cThis is what the Lord says: 'They will eat and will have food left over.'\u201d ", "44": "After he gave it to them, the people ate and had food left over, as the Lord had said."}

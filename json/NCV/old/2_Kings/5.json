{"1": "Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was honored by his master, and he had much respect because the Lord used him to give victory to Aram. He was a mighty and brave man, but he had a skin disease.", "2": "The Arameans had gone out to raid the Israelites and had taken a little girl as a captive. This little girl served Naaman's wife. ", "3": "She said to her mistress, \u201cI wish my master would meet the prophet who lives in Samaria. He would cure him of his disease.\u201d", "4": "Naaman went to the king and told him what the girl from Israel had said. ", "5": "The king of Aram said, \u201cGo ahead, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\u201d So Naaman left and took with him about seven hundred fifty pounds of silver, as well as one hundred fifty pounds of gold and ten changes of clothes. ", "6": "He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, \u201cI am sending my servant Naaman to you so you can heal him of his skin disease.\u201d", "7": "When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. He said, \u201cI'm not God! I can't kill and make alive again! Why does this man send someone with a skin disease for me to heal? You can see that the king of Aram is trying to start trouble with me.\u201d", "8": "When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent the king this message: \u201cWhy have you torn your clothes? Let Naaman come to me. Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel.\u201d ", "9": "So Naaman went with his horses and chariots to Elisha's house and stood outside the door.", "10": "Elisha sent Naaman a messenger who said, \u201cGo and wash in the Jordan River seven times. Then your skin will be healed, and you will be clean.\u201d", "11": "Naaman became angry and left. He said, \u201cI thought Elisha would surely come out and stand before me and call on the name of the Lord his God. I thought he would wave his hand over the place and heal the disease. ", "12": "The Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, are better than all the waters of Israel. Why can't I wash in them and become clean?\u201d So Naaman went away very angry.", "13": "Naaman's servants came near and said to him, \u201cMy father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? Doesn't it make more sense just to do it? After all, he only told you, 'Wash, and you will be clean.'\u201d ", "14": "So Naaman went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, just as Elisha had said. Then his skin became new again, like the skin of a child. And he was clean.", "15": "Naaman and all his group returned to Elisha. He stood before Elisha and said, \u201cLook, I now know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Now please accept a gift from me.\u201d", "16": "But Elisha said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives whom I serve, I won't accept anything.\u201d Naaman urged him to take the gift, but he refused.", "17": "Then Naaman said, \u201cIf you won't take the gift, then please give me some soil\u2014as much as two of my mules can carry. From now on I'll not offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other gods but the Lord. ", "18": "But let the Lord pardon me for this: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon[a] to worship, he leans on my arm. Then I must bow in that temple. May the Lord pardon me when I do that.\u201d", "19": "Elisha said to him, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d Naaman left Elisha and went a short way. ", "20": "Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, \u201cMy master has not accepted what Naaman the Aramean brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I'll run after him and get something from him.\u201d ", "21": "So Gehazi went after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got off the chariot to meet Gehazi. He asked, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d", "22": "Gehazi said, \u201cEverything is all right. My master has sent me. He said, 'Two young men from the groups of prophets in the mountains of Ephraim just came to me. Please give them seventy-five pounds of silver and two changes of clothes.'\u201d", "23": "Naaman said, \u201cPlease take one hundred fifty pounds,\u201d and he urged Gehazi to take it. He tied one hundred fifty pounds of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes. Then he gave them to two of his servants to carry for Gehazi. ", "24": "When they came to the hill, Gehazi took these things from Naaman's servants and put them in the house. Then he let Naaman's servants go, and they left.", "25": "When he came in and stood before his master, Elisha said to him, \u201cWhere have you been, Gehazi?\u201d \u201cI didn't go anywhere,\u201d he answered.", "26": "But Elisha said to him, \u201cMy spirit was with you. I knew when the man turned from his chariot to meet you. This isn't a time to take money, clothes, olives, grapes, sheep, oxen, male servants, or female servants. ", "27": "So Naaman's skin disease will come on you and your children forever.\u201d When Gehazi left Elisha, he had the disease and was as white as snow."}

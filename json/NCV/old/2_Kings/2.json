{"1": "It was almost time for the Lord to take Elijah by a whirlwind up into heaven. While Elijah and Elisha were leaving Gilgal, ", "2": "Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cPlease stay here. The Lord has told me to go to Bethel.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So they went down to Bethel. ", "3": "The groups of prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, \u201cDo you know the Lord will take your master away from you today?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cYes, I know, but don't talk about it.\u201d", "4": "Elijah said to him, \u201cStay here, Elisha, because the Lord has sent me to Jericho.\u201d But Elisha said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So they went to Jericho. ", "5": "The groups of prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said, \u201cDo you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?\u201d Elisha answered, \u201cYes, I know, but don't talk about it.\u201d", "6": "Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cStay here. The Lord has sent me to the Jordan River.\u201d Elisha answered, \u201cAs the Lord lives, and as you live, I won't leave you.\u201d So the two of them went on. ", "7": "Fifty men of the groups of prophets came and stood far from where Elijah and Elisha were by the Jordan. ", "8": "Elijah took off his coat, rolled it up, and hit the water. The water divided to the right and to the left, and Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.", "9": "After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cWhat can I do for you before I am taken from you?\u201d Elisha said, \u201cLeave me a double share of your spirit.\u201d[a]", "10": "Elijah said, \u201cYou have asked a hard thing. But if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours. If you don't, it won't happen.\u201d", "11": "As they were walking and talking, a chariot and horses of fire appeared and separated Elijah from Elisha. Then Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. ", "12": "Elisha saw it and shouted, \u201cMy father! My father! The chariots of Israel and their horsemen!\u201d And Elisha did not see him anymore. Then Elisha grabbed his own clothes and tore them to show how sad he was.", "13": "He picked up Elijah's coat that had fallen from him. Then he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan. ", "14": "Elisha hit the water with Elijah's coat and said, \u201cWhere is the Lord, the God of Elijah?\u201d When he hit the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over.", "15": "The groups of prophets at Jericho were watching and said, \u201cElisha now has the spirit Elijah had.\u201d And they came to meet him, bowing down to the ground before him. ", "16": "They said to him, \u201cThere are fifty strong men with us. Please let them go and look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the Lord has taken Elijah up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley.\u201d But Elisha answered, \u201cNo, don't send them.\u201d", "17": "When the groups of prophets had begged Elisha until he couldn't refuse them anymore, he said, \u201cSend them.\u201d So they sent fifty men who looked for three days, but they could not find him.

He said to them, \u201cI told you not to go, didn't I?\u201d", "19": "The people of the city said to Elisha, \u201cLook, master, this city is a nice place to live as you can see. But the water is so bad the land cannot grow crops.\u201d", "20": "Elisha said, \u201cBring me a new bowl and put salt in it.\u201d So they brought it to him.", "21": "Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it. He said, \u201cThis is what the Lord says: 'I have healed this water. From now on it won't cause death, and it won't keep the land from growing crops.'\u201d ", "22": "So the water has been healed to this day just as Elisha had said.", "23": "From there Elisha went up to Bethel. On the way some boys came out of the city and made fun of him. They said to him, \u201cGo up too, you baldhead! Go up too, you baldhead!\u201d ", "24": "Elisha turned around, looked at them, and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two mother bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces. ", "25": "Elisha went to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria."}

", "3": "Hezekiah did what the Lord said was right, just as his ancestor David had done. ", "4": "He removed the places where gods were worshiped. He smashed the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah idols. Also the Israelites had been burning incense to Nehushtan, the bronze snake Moses had made. But Hezekiah broke it into pieces.", "5": "Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him. ", "6": "Hezekiah was loyal to the Lord and did not stop following him; he obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses. ", "7": "And the Lord was with Hezekiah, so he had success in everything he did. He turned against the king of Assyria and stopped serving him. ", "8": "Hezekiah defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its borders, including the watchtowers and the strong, walled cities.", "9": "Shalmaneser king of Assyria surrounded Samaria and attacked it in the fourth year Hezekiah was king.

", "11": "The king of Assyria took the Israelites away to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes. ", "12": "This happened because they did not obey the Lord their God. They broke his agreement and did not obey all that Moses, the Lord's servant, had commanded. They would not listen to the commands or do them.", "13": "During Hezekiah's fourteenth year as king, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the strong, walled cities of Judah and captured them. ", "14": "Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish. He said, \u201cI have done wrong.

", "15": "Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was in the Temple of the Lord and in the palace treasuries.

They went with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When they came near the waterway from the upper pool on the road where people do their laundry, they stopped.

", "21": "Look, you are depending on Egypt to help you, but Egypt is like a splintered walking stick. If you lean on it for help, it will stab your hand and hurt you. The king of Egypt will hurt all those who depend on him. ", "22": "You might say, \u201cWe are depending on the Lord our God,\u201d but Hezekiah destroyed the Lord's altars and the places of worship. Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem, \u201cYou must worship only at this one altar in Jerusalem.\u201d", "23": "\u201c'Now make an agreement with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses if you can find enough men to ride them. ", "24": "You cannot defeat one of my master's least important officers, so why do you depend on Egypt to give you chariots and horsemen? ", "25": "I have not come to attack and destroy this place without an order from the Lord. The Lord himself told me to come to this country and destroy it.'\u201d", "26": "Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, \u201cPlease speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew, because the people on the city wall can hear you.\u201d", "27": "\u201cNo,\u201d the commander said, \u201cmy master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king. He sent me to speak also to those people sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you.\u201d", "28": "Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language, \u201cListen to what the great king, the king of Assyria, says! ", "29": "The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you, because he can't save you from my power.

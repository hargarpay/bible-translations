{"1": "At the same time, Elisha the prophet called a man from the groups of prophets. Elisha said, \u201cGet ready, and take this small bottle of olive oil in your hand. Go to Ramoth in Gilead. ", "2": "When you arrive, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in and make Jehu get up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room. ", "3": "Then take the bottle and pour the oil on Jehu's head and say, 'This is what the Lord says: I have appointed you king over Israel.' Then open the door and run away. Don't wait!\u201d", "4": "So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth in Gilead. ", "5": "When he arrived, he saw the officers of the army sitting together. He said, \u201cCommander, I have a message for you.\u201d Jehu asked, \u201cFor which one of us?\u201d The young man said, \u201cFor you, commander.\u201d", "6": "Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head and said to him, \u201cThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: 'I have appointed you king over the Lord's people Israel. ", "7": "You must destroy the family of Ahab your master. I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants the prophets and for all the Lord's servants who were murdered. ", "8": "All of Ahab's family must die. I will not let any male child in Ahab's family live in Israel, whether slave or free. ", "9": "I will make Ahab's family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah. ", "10": "The dogs will eat Jezebel at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'\u201d Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away.", "11": "When Jehu went back to his master's officers, one of them said to Jehu, \u201cIs everything all right? Why did this crazy man come to you?\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cYou know the man and how he talks.\u201d", "12": "They answered, \u201cThat's not true. Tell us.\u201d Jehu said, \u201cHe said to me, 'This is what the Lord says: I have appointed you to be king over Israel.'\u201d", "13": "Then the officers hurried, and each man took off his own coat and put it on the stairs for Jehu. They blew the trumpet and shouted, \u201cJehu is king!\u201d", "14": "So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, made plans against Joram. Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth in Gilead from Hazael king of Aram. ", "15": "But King Joram had to return to Jezreel to heal from the injuries the Arameans had given him when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, \u201cIf you agree with this, don't let anyone leave the city. They might tell the news in Jezreel.\u201d ", "16": "Then he got into his chariot and set out for Jezreel, where Joram was resting. Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.", "17": "The lookout was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel when he saw Jehu's troops coming. He said, \u201cI see some soldiers!\u201d Joram said, \u201cTake a horseman and send him to meet them. Tell him to ask, 'Is all in order?'\u201d", "18": "The horseman rode out to meet Jehu, and he said, \u201cThis is what the king says: 'Is all in order?'\u201d Jehu said, \u201cWhy bother yourself with order? Come along behind me.\u201d The lookout reported, \u201cThe messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.\u201d", "19": "Then Joram sent out a second horseman. This rider came to Jehu's group and said, \u201cThis is what the king says: 'Is all in order?'\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cWhy bother yourself with order? Come along behind me.\u201d", "20": "The lookout reported, \u201cThe second man reached them, but he is not coming back. The man in the chariot is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi. He drives as if he were crazy!\u201d", "21": "Joram said, \u201cGet my chariot ready.\u201d Then the servant got Joram's chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.", "22": "When Joram saw Jehu, he said, \u201cIs all in order, Jehu?\u201d Jehu answered, \u201cThere will never be any order as long as your mother Jezebel worships idols and uses witchcraft.\u201d", "23": "Joram turned the horses to run away and yelled to Ahaziah, \u201cIt's a trick, Ahaziah!\u201d", "24": "Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow went through Joram's heart, and he fell down in his chariot.", "25": "Jehu ordered Bidkar, his chariot officer, \u201cPick up Joram's body, and throw it into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I rode together with Joram's father Ahab. The Lord made this prophecy against him: ", "26": "'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons, says the Lord, so I will punish Ahab in his field, says the Lord.' Take Joram's body and throw it into the field, as the Lord has said.\u201d", "27": "When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he ran away toward Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, saying, \u201cShoot Ahaziah, too!\u201d Ahaziah was wounded in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam. He got as far as Megiddo but died there. ", "28": "Ahaziah's servants carried his body in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in Jerusalem. ", "29": "(Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year Joram son of Ahab was king.)", "30": "When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it. She put on her eye makeup and fixed her hair. Then she looked out the window. ", "31": "When Jehu entered the city gate, Jezebel said, \u201cHave you come in peace, you Zimri,[a] you who killed your master?\u201d", "32": "Jehu looked up at the window and said, \u201cWho is on my side? Who?\u201d Two or three servants looked out the window at Jehu. ", "33": "He said to them, \u201cThrow her down.\u201d So they threw Jezebel down, and the horses ran over her. Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses.", "34": "Jehu went into the house and ate and drank. Then he said, \u201cNow see about this cursed woman. Bury her, because she is a king's daughter.\u201d", "35": "The men went to bury Jezebel, but they could not find her. They found only her skull, feet, and the palms of her hands. ", "36": "When they came back and told Jehu, he said, \u201cThe Lord said this through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: 'The dogs will eat Jezebel at Jezreel. ", "37": "Her body will be like manure on the field in the land at Jezreel. No one will be able to say that this is Jezebel.'\u201d"}

He sent messengers and told them, \u201cGo, ask Baal-Zebub, god of Ekron, if I will recover from my injuries.\u201d", "3": "But the Lord's angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, \u201cGo up and meet the messengers sent by the king of Samaria. Ask them, 'Why are you going to ask questions of Baal-Zebub, god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel?'

{"1": "Elisha said, \u201cListen to the Lord's word. This is what the Lord says: 'About this time tomorrow seven quarts of fine flour will be sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver, and thirteen quarts of barley will be sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver. This will happen at the gate of Samaria.'\u201d", "2": "Then the officer who was close to the king answered Elisha, \u201cEven if the Lord opened windows in the sky, that couldn't happen.\u201d Elisha said, \u201cYou will see it with your eyes, but you will not eat any of it.\u201d", "3": "There were four men with a skin disease at the entrance to the city gate. They said to each other, \u201cWhy do we sit here until we die? ", "4": "There is no food in the city. So if we go into the city, we will die there. If we stay here, we will die. So let's go to the Aramean camp. If they let us live, we will live. If they kill us, we die.\u201d", "5": "So they got up at twilight and went to the Aramean camp, but when they arrived, no one was there. ", "6": "The Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a large army. They had said to each other, \u201cThe king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!\u201d ", "7": "So they got up and ran away in the twilight, leaving their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp standing and ran for their lives.", "8": "When the men with the skin disease came to the edge of the camp, they went into one of the tents and ate and drank. They carried silver, gold, and clothes out of the camp and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent. They carried things from this tent and hid them, also. ", "9": "Then they said to each other, \u201cWe're doing wrong. Today we have good news, but we are silent. If we wait until the sun comes up, we'll be discovered. Let's go right now and tell the people in the king's palace.\u201d", "10": "So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city. They said, \u201cWe went to the Aramean camp, but no one is there; we didn't hear anyone. The horses and donkeys were still tied up, and the tents were still standing.\u201d ", "11": "Then the gatekeepers shouted out and told the people in the palace.", "12": "The king got up in the night and said to his officers, \u201cI'll tell you what the Arameans are doing to us. They know we are starving. They have gone out of the camp to hide in the field. They're saying, 'When the Israelites come out of the city, we'll capture them alive. Then we'll enter the city.'\u201d", "13": "One of his officers answered, \u201cLet some men take five of the horses that are still left in the city. These men are like all the Israelites who are left; they are also about to die. Let's send them to see what has happened.\u201d", "14": "So the men took two chariots with horses. The king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, \u201cGo and see what has happened.\u201d ", "15": "The men followed the Aramean army as far as the Jordan River. The road was full of clothes and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away as they had hurriedly left. So the messengers returned and told the king. ", "16": "Then the people went out and took valuables from the Aramean camp. So seven quarts of fine flour were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver, and thirteen quarts of barley were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver, just as the Lord had said.", "17": "The king chose the officer who was close to him to guard the gate, but the people trampled the officer to death. This happened just as Elisha had told the king when the king came to his house. ", "18": "He had said, \u201cThirteen quarts of barley and seven quarts of fine flour will each sell for two-fifths of an ounce of silver about this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria.\u201d", "19": "But the officer had answered, \u201cEven if the Lord opened windows in the sky, that couldn't happen.\u201d And Elisha had told him, \u201cYou will see it with your eyes, but you won't eat any of it.\u201d ", "20": "It happened to the officer just that way. The people trampled him in the gateway, and he died."}

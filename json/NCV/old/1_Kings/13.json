{"1": "The Lord commanded a man of God from Judah to go to Bethel. When he arrived, Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer a sacrifice. ", "2": "The Lord had commanded the man of God to speak against the altar. The man said, \u201cAltar, altar, the Lord says to you: 'David's family will have a son named Josiah. The priests for the places of worship now make their sacrifices on you, but Josiah will sacrifice those priests on you. Human bones will be burned on you.'\u201d ", "3": "That same day the man of God gave proof that these things would happen. \u201cThis is the Lord's sign that this will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis altar will break apart, and the ashes on it will fall to the ground.\u201d", "4": "When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God said about the altar in Bethel, the king raised his hand from the altar and pointed at the man. \u201cTake him!\u201d he said. But when the king said this, his arm was paralyzed, and he could not move it. ", "5": "The altar also broke into pieces, and its ashes fell to the ground. This was the sign the Lord had told the man of God to give.", "6": "Then the king said to the man of God, \u201cPlease pray to the Lord your God for me, and ask him to heal my arm.\u201d So the man of God prayed to the Lord, and the king's arm was healed, becoming as it was before.", "7": "Then the king said to the man of God, \u201cPlease come home and eat with me, and I will give you a gift.\u201d", "8": "But the man of God answered the king, \u201cEven if you gave me half of your kingdom, I would not go with you. I will not eat or drink anything in this place. ", "9": "The Lord commanded me not to eat or drink anything nor to return on the same road by which I came.\u201d ", "10": "So he took a different road and did not return on the same road by which he had come to Bethel.", "11": "Now an old prophet was living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to King Jeroboam. ", "12": "The father asked, \u201cWhich road did he use when he left?\u201d So his sons showed him the road the man of God from Judah had taken. ", "13": "Then the prophet told his sons to put a saddle on his donkey. So they saddled the donkey, and he left.", "14": "He went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. The prophet asked, \u201cAre you the man of God who came from Judah?\u201d The man answered, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d", "15": "The prophet said, \u201cPlease come home and eat with me.\u201d", "16": "\u201cI can't go home with you,\u201d the man of God answered. \u201cI can't eat or drink with you in this place. ", "17": "The Lord said to me, 'Don't eat or drink anything there or return on the same road by which you came.'\u201d", "18": "Then the old prophet said, \u201cBut I also am a prophet like you.\u201d Then he told a lie. He said, \u201cAn angel from the Lord came to me and told me to bring you to my home. He said you should eat and drink with me.\u201d ", "19": "So the man of God went to the old prophet's house, and he ate and drank with him there.", "20": "While they were sitting at the table, the Lord spoke his word to the old prophet. ", "21": "The old prophet cried out to the man of God from Judah, \u201cThe Lord said you did not obey him! He said you did not do what the Lord your God commanded you. ", "22": "The Lord commanded you not to eat or drink anything in this place, but you came back and ate and drank. So your body will not be buried in your family grave.\u201d", "23": "After the man of God finished eating and drinking, the prophet put a saddle on his donkey for him, and the man left. ", "24": "As he was traveling home, a lion attacked and killed him. His body lay on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing nearby. ", "25": "Some men who were traveling on that road saw the body and the lion standing nearby. So they went to the city where the old prophet lived and told what they had seen.", "26": "The old prophet who had brought back the man of God heard what had happened. \u201cIt is the man of God who did not obey the Lord's command,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the Lord sent a lion to kill him, just as he said he would.\u201d", "27": "Then the prophet said to his sons, \u201cPut a saddle on my donkey,\u201d which they did. ", "28": "The old prophet went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing nearby. The lion had not eaten the body or hurt the donkey. ", "29": "The prophet put the body on his donkey and carried it back to the city to have a time of sadness for him and to bury him. ", "30": "The prophet buried the body in his own family grave, and they were sad for the man of God and said, \u201cOh, my brother.\u201d", "31": "After the prophet buried the body, he said to his sons, \u201cWhen I die, bury me in this same grave. Put my bones next to his. ", "32": "Through him the Lord spoke against the altar at Bethel and against the places of worship in the towns of Samaria. What the Lord spoke through him will certainly come true.\u201d", "33": "After this incident King Jeroboam did not stop doing evil. He continued to choose priests for the places of worship from among all the people. Anyone who wanted to be a priest for the places of worship was allowed to be one. ", "34": "In this way the family of Jeroboam sinned, and this sin caused its ruin and destruction from the earth."}

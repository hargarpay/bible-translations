If you do these things, you will be successful in all you do and wherever you go. ", "4": "And if you obey the Lord, he will keep the promise he made to me. He said: 'If your descendants live as I tell them and have complete faith in me, a man from your family will always be king over the people of Israel.'", "5": "\u201cAlso, you remember what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me. He killed the two commanders of Israel's armies: Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He did this as if he and they were at war, although it was a time of peace. He put their blood on the belt around his waist and on his sandals on his feet.

You are a wise man, and you will know what to do to him, but you must be sure he is killed.\u201d", "10": "Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem.

Then she sat down at his right side.", "20": "Bathsheba said, \u201cI have one small thing to ask you. Please do not refuse me.\u201d \u201cAsk, mother,\u201d the king answered. \u201cI will not refuse you.\u201d", "21": "So she said, \u201cAllow Abishag the Shunammite to marry your brother Adonijah.\u201d", "22": "King Solomon answered his mother, \u201cWhy do you ask me to give him Abishag? Why don't you also ask for him to become the king since he is my older brother? Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah would support him!\u201d", "23": "Then King Solomon swore by the name of the Lord, saying, \u201cMay God punish me terribly if this doesn't cost Adonijah his life!

I will not kill you at this time, because you helped carry the Ark of the Lord God while marching with my father David. And I know you shared in all the hard times with him.\u201d ", "27": "Then Solomon removed Abiathar from being the Lord's priest. This happened as the Lord had said it would, when he was speaking in Shiloh about the priest Eli and his descendants.", "28": "When Joab heard about what had happened, he was afraid.

", "31": "Then the king ordered Benaiah, \u201cDo as he says! Kill him there and bury him. Then my family and I will be free of the guilt of Joab, who has killed innocent people. ", "32": "Without my father knowing it, he killed two men who were much better than he was\u2014Abner son of Ner, the commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, the commander of Judah's army.

", "35": "The king then made Benaiah son of Jehoiada commander of the army in Joab's place. He also made Zadok the new high priest in Abiathar's place.", "36": "Next the king sent for Shimei. Solomon said to him, \u201cBuild a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there. Don't leave the city.

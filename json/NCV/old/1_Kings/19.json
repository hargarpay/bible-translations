", "2": "So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, \u201cMay the gods punish me terribly if by this time tomorrow I don't kill you just as you killed those prophets.\u201d", "3": "When Elijah heard this, he was afraid and ran for his life, taking his servant with him. When they came to Beersheba in Judah, Elijah left his servant there. ", "4": "Then Elijah walked for a whole day into the desert. He sat down under a bush and asked to die. \u201cI have had enough, Lord,\u201d he prayed. \u201cLet me die. I am no better than my ancestors.\u201d ", "5": "Then he lay down under the tree and slept. Suddenly an angel came to him and touched him. \u201cGet up and eat,\u201d the angel said. ", "6": "Elijah saw near his head a loaf baked over coals and a jar of water, so he ate and drank. Then he went back to sleep.", "7": "Later the Lord's angel came to him a second time. The angel touched him and said, \u201cGet up and eat. If you don't, the journey will be too hard for you.\u201d ", "8": "So Elijah got up and ate and drank. The food made him strong enough to walk for forty days and nights to Mount Sinai, the mountain of God. ", "9": "There Elijah went into a cave and stayed all night. Then the Lord spoke his word to him: \u201cElijah! Why are you here?\u201d", "10": "He answered, \u201cLord God All-Powerful, I have always served you as well as I could. But the people of Israel have broken their agreement with you, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with swords. I am the only prophet left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.\u201d", "11": "The Lord said to Elijah, \u201cGo, stand in front of me on the mountain, and I will pass by you.\u201d Then a very strong wind blew until it caused the mountains to fall apart and large rocks to break in front of the Lord . But the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. ", "12": "After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a quiet, gentle sound. ", "13": "When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his coat and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. Then a voice said to him, \u201cElijah! Why are you here?\u201d", "14": "He answered, \u201cLord God All-Powerful, I have always served you as well as I could.

He owned twelve teams of oxen and was plowing with the twelfth team. Elijah came up to Elisha, took off his coat, and put it on Elisha. ", "20": "Then Elisha left his oxen and ran to follow Elijah. \u201cLet me kiss my father and my mother good-bye,\u201d Elisha said. \u201cThen I will go with you.\u201d Elijah answered, \u201cGo back. It does not matter to me.\u201d", "21": "So Elisha went back and took his pair of oxen and killed them. He used their wooden yoke for a fire. Then he cooked the meat and gave it to the people. After they ate it, Elisha left and followed Elijah and became his helper."}

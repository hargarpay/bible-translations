{"1": "How terrible it will be for people who plan wickedness, who lie on their beds and make evil plans. When the morning light comes, they do what they planned, because they have the power to do so.", "2": "They want fields, so they take them; they want houses, so they take them away. They cheat people to get their houses; they rob them even of their property.", "3": "That is why the Lord says: \u201cLook, I am planning trouble against such people, and you won't be able to save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, because it will be a terrible time.", "4": "At that time people will make fun of you and sing this sad song about you: 'We are completely ruined; the Lord has taken away my people's land. Yes, he has taken it away from me and divided our fields among our enemies!'\u201d", "5": "So you will have no one from the Lord's people to throw lots to divide the land.", "6": "The prophets say, \u201cDon't prophesy to us! Don't prophesy about these things! Nothing to make us feel bad will happen!\u201d", "7": "But I must say this, people of Jacob: The Lord is becoming angry about what you have done. My words are welcome to the person who does what is right.", "8": "But you are fighting against my people like an enemy.

This is not your place of rest anymore. You have made this place unclean, and it is doomed to destruction.", "11": "But you people want a false prophet who will tell you nothing but lies. You want one who promises to prophesy good things for you if you give him wine and beer. He's just the prophet for you.", "12": "\u201cYes, people of Jacob, I will bring all of you together; I will bring together all those left alive in Israel. I will put them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will be filled with many people.", "13": "Someone will open the way and lead the people out. The people will break through the gate and leave the city where they were held captive. Their king will go out in front of them, and the Lord will lead them.\u201d"}

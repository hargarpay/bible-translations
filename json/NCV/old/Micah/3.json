You skin my people alive and tear the flesh off their bones.", "3": "You eat my people's flesh and skin them and break their bones; you chop them up like meat for the pot, like meat in a cooking pan.", "4": "They will cry to the Lord, but he won't answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them, because what they have done is evil.\u201d", "5": "The Lord says this about the prophets who teach his people the wrong way of living: \u201cIf these prophets are given food to eat, they shout, 'Peace!'

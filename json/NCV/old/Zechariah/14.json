They will capture the city and rob the houses and attack the women. Half the people will be taken away as captives, but the rest of the people won't be taken from the city.", "3": "Then the Lord will go to war against those nations; he will fight as in a day of battle. ", "4": "On that day he will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem. The Mount of Olives will split in two, forming a deep valley that runs east and west. Half the mountain will move toward the north, and half will move toward the south. ", "5": "You will run through this mountain valley to the other side, just as you ran from the earthquake when Uzziah was king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come and all the holy ones with him.", "6": "On that day there will be no light, cold, or frost. ", "7": "There will be no other day like it, and the Lord knows when it will come. There will be no day or night; even at evening it will still be light.", "8": "At that time fresh water will flow from Jerusalem. Half of it will flow east to the Dead Sea, and half will flow west to the Mediterranean Sea. It will flow summer and winter.", "9": "Then the Lord will be king over the whole world. At that time there will be only one Lord, and his name will be the only name.", "10": "All the land south of Jerusalem from Geba to Rimmon will be turned into a plain. Jerusalem will be raised up, but it will stay in the same place. The city will reach from the Benjamin Gate and to the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. ", "11": "People will live there, and it will never be destroyed again. Jerusalem will be safe.", "12": "But the Lord will bring a terrible disease on the nations that fought against Jerusalem. Their flesh will rot away while they are still standing up. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. ", "13": "At that time the Lord will cause panic. Everybody will grab his neighbor, and they will attack each other. ", "14": "The people of Judah will fight in Jerusalem. And the wealth of the nations around them will be collected\u2014much gold, silver, and clothes.

Then the Lord will send them the same terrible disease he sent the other nations that did not celebrate the Feast of Shelters. ", "19": "This will be the punishment for Egypt and any nation which does not go to celebrate the Feast of Shelters.", "20": "At that time the horses' bells will have written on them: holy to the lord. The cooking pots in the Temple of the Lord will be like the holy altar bowls. ", "21": "Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord All-Powerful, and everyone who offers sacrifices will be able to take food from them and cook in them. At that time there will not be any buyers or sellers in the Temple of the Lord All-Powerful."}

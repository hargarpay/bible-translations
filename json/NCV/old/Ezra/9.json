The leaders and officers of Israel have led the rest of the Israelites to do this unfaithful thing.\u201d", "3": "When I heard this, I angrily tore my robe and coat, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down in shock. ", "4": "Everyone who trembled in fear at the word of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the captives who had returned. I sat there in shock until the evening sacrifice.", "5": "At the evening sacrifice I got up from where I had shown my shame. My robe and coat were torn, and I fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God.

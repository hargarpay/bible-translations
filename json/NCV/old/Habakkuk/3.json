God has always done this.", "7": "I saw that the tents of Cushan were in trouble and that the tents of Midian trembled.", "8": "Lord, were you angry at the rivers, or were you angry at the streams?

He makes me like a deer that does not stumble so I can walk on the steep mountains. For the director of music. On my stringed instruments."}

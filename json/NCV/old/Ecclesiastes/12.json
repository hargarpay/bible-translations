Your teeth will fall out so you cannot chew, and your eyes will not see clearly.", "4": "Your ears will be deaf to the noise in the streets, and you will barely hear the millstone grinding grain. You'll wake up when a bird starts singing, but you will barely hear singing.", "5": "You will fear high places and will be afraid to go for a walk. Your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree. You will limp along like a grasshopper when you walk. Your appetite will be gone. Then you will go to your everlasting home, and people will go to your funeral.", "6": "Soon your life will snap like a silver chain or break like a golden bowl. You will be like a broken pitcher at a spring, or a broken wheel at a well.", "7": "You will turn back into the dust of the earth again, but your spirit will return to God who gave it.", "8": "Everything is useless!

They are like nails that have been driven in firmly. Altogether they are wise teachings that come from one Shepherd. ", "12": "So be careful, my son, about other teachings.

{"1": "It was the month of Nisan in the twentieth year Artaxerxes was king. He wanted some wine, so I took some and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before. ", "2": "So the king said, \u201cWhy does your face look sad even though you are not sick? Your heart must be sad.\u201d Then I was very afraid. ", "3": "I said to the king, \u201cMay the king live forever! My face is sad because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire.\u201d", "4": "Then the king said to me, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d First I prayed to the God of heaven. ", "5": "Then I answered the king, \u201cIf you are willing and if I have pleased you, send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so I can rebuild it.\u201d", "6": "The queen was sitting next to the king. He asked me, \u201cHow long will your trip take, and when will you get back?\u201d It pleased the king to send me, so I set a time.", "7": "I also said to him, \u201cIf you are willing, give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates. Tell them to let me pass safely through their lands on my way to Judah. ", "8": "And may I have a letter for Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, telling him to give me timber? I will need it to make boards for the gates of the palace, which is by the Temple, and for the city wall, and for the house in which I will live.\u201d So the king gave me the letters, because God was showing kindness to me. ", "9": "Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and soldiers on horses with me.", "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite officer heard about this, they were upset that someone had come to help the Israelites.", "11": "I went to Jerusalem and stayed there three days. ", "12": "Then at night I started out with a few men. I had not told anyone what God had caused me to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me except the one I was riding.", "13": "I went out at night through the Valley Gate. I rode toward the Dragon Well and the Trash Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been destroyed by fire. ", "14": "Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for the animal I was riding to pass through. ", "15": "So I went up the valley at night, inspecting the wall. Finally, I turned and went back in through the Valley Gate. ", "16": "The guards did not know where I had gone or what I was doing. I had not yet said anything to the Jewish people, the priests, the important men, the officers, or any of the others who would do the work.", "17": "Then I said to them, \u201cYou can see the trouble we have here. Jerusalem is a pile of ruins, and its gates have been burned. Come, let's rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so we won't be full of shame any longer.\u201d ", "18": "I also told them how God had been kind to me and what the king had said to me. Then they answered, \u201cLet's start rebuilding.\u201d So they began to work hard.", "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite officer, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they made fun of us and laughed at us. They said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you turning against the king?\u201d", "20": "But I answered them, \u201cThe God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will start rebuilding, but you have no share, claim, or memorial in Jerusalem.\u201d"}

", "2": "He said to his friends and those with power in Samaria, \u201cWhat are these weak Jews doing? Will they rebuild the wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in one day? Can they bring stones back to life from piles of trash and ashes?\u201d", "3": "Tobiah the Ammonite, who was next to Sanballat, said, \u201cIf a fox climbed up on the stone wall they are building, it would break it down.\u201d", "4": "I prayed, \u201cHear us, our God. We are hated. Turn the insults of Sanballat and Tobiah back on their own heads. Let them be captured and stolen like valuables. ", "5": "Do not hide their guilt or take away their sins so that you can't see them, because they have insulted the builders.\u201d", "6": "So we rebuilt the wall to half its height, because the people were willing to work.", "7": "But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from Ashdod were very angry when they heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls were continuing and that the holes in the wall were being closed.

", "9": "But we prayed to our God and appointed guards to watch for them day and night.", "10": "The people of Judah said, \u201cThe workers are getting tired. There is so much trash we cannot rebuild the wall.\u201d", "11": "And our enemies said, \u201cThe Jews won't know or see anything until we come among them and kill them and stop the work.\u201d", "12": "Then the Jewish people who lived near our enemies came and told us ten times, \u201cEverywhere you turn, the enemy will attack us.\u201d ", "13": "So I put people behind the lowest places along the wall\u2014the open places\u2014and I put families together with their swords, spears, and bows.

Our God will fight for us.\u201d", "21": "So we continued to work with half the men holding spears from sunrise till the stars came out.

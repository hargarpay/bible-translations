To eat and stay alive, we need grain.\u201d", "3": "Others were saying, \u201cWe are borrowing money against our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain because there is not much food.\u201d", "4": "And still others were saying, \u201cWe are borrowing money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards. ", "5": "We are just like our fellow Jews, and our sons are like their sons. But we have to sell our sons and daughters as slaves. Some of our daughters have already been sold. But there is nothing we can do, because our fields and vineyards already belong to other people.\u201d", "6": "When I heard their complaints about these things, I was very angry. ", "7": "After I thought about it, I accused the important people and the leaders, \u201cYou are charging your own brothers too much interest.\u201d So I called a large meeting to deal with them. ", "8": "I said to them, \u201cAs much as possible, we have bought freedom for our fellow Jews who had been sold to foreigners. Now you are selling your fellow Jews to us!\u201d The leaders were quiet and had nothing to say.", "9": "Then I said, \u201cWhat you are doing is not right. Don't you fear God?

The governors' helpers before me also controlled the people, but I did not do that, because I feared God. ", "16": "I worked on the wall, as did all my men who were gathered there. We did not buy any fields.", "17": "Also, I fed one hundred fifty Jewish people and officers at my table, as well as those who came from the nations around us.

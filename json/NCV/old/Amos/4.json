{"1": "Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan[a] on the Mountain of Samaria. You take things from the poor and crush people who are in need. Then you command your husbands, \u201cBring us something to drink!\u201d", "2": "The Lord God has promised this: \u201cJust as surely as I am a holy God, the time will come when you will be taken away by hooks, and what is left of you with fishhooks.", "3": "You will go straight out of the city through holes in the walls, and you will be thrown on the garbage dump,\u201d says the Lord.", "4": "\u201cCome to the city of Bethel and sin; come to Gilgal and sin even more. Offer your sacrifices every morning, and bring one-tenth of your crops every three days.", "5": "Offer bread made with yeast as a sacrifice to show your thanks, and brag about the special offerings you bring, because this is what you love to do, Israelites,\u201d says the Lord God.", "6": "\u201cI did not give you any food in your cities, and there was not enough to eat in any of your towns, but you did not come back to me,\u201d says the Lord.", "7": "\u201cI held back the rain from you three months before harvest time.

I made you smell the stink from all the dead bodies, but still you did not come back to me,\u201d says the Lord.", "11": "\u201cI destroyed some of you as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick pulled from a fire, but still you did not come back to me,\u201d says the Lord.", "12": "\u201cSo this is what I will do to you, Israel; because I will do this to you, get ready to meet your God, Israel.\u201d", "13": "He is the one who makes the mountains and creates the wind and makes his thoughts known to people. He changes the dawn into darkness and walks over the mountains of the earth. His name is the Lord God All-Powerful."}

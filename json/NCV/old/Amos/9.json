Not one person will get away; no one will escape.", "2": "If they dig down as deep as the place of the dead, I will pull them up from there. If they climb up into heaven, I will bring them down from there.", "3": "If they hide at the top of Mount Carmel, I will find them and take them away. If they try to hide from me at the bottom of the sea, I will command a snake to bite them.", "4": "If they are captured and taken away by their enemies, I will command the sword to kill them. I will keep watch over them, but I will keep watch to give them trouble, not to do them good.\u201d", "5": "The Lord God All-Powerful touches the land, and the land shakes. Then everyone who lives in the land cries for the dead. The whole land rises like the Nile River and falls like the river of Egypt.", "6": "The Lord builds his upper rooms above the skies; he sets their foundations on the earth. He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the land. The Lord is his name.", "7": "The Lord says, \u201cIsrael, you are no different to me than the people of Cush.

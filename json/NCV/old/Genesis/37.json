{"1": "Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived. ", "2": "This is the family history of Jacob: Joseph was a young man, seventeen years old. He and his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives, cared for the flocks. Joseph gave his father bad reports about his brothers. ", "3": "Since Joseph was born when his father Israel[a] was old, Israel loved him more than his other sons. He made Joseph a special robe with long sleeves. ", "4": "When Joseph's brothers saw that their father loved him more than he loved them, they hated their brother and could not speak to him politely.", "5": "One time Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more. ", "6": "Joseph said, \u201cListen to the dream I had. ", "7": "We were in the field tying bundles of wheat together. My bundle stood up, and your bundles of wheat gathered around it and bowed down to it.\u201d", "8": "His brothers said, \u201cDo you really think you will be king over us? Do you truly think you will rule over us?\u201d His brothers hated him even more because of his dreams and what he had said.", "9": "Then Joseph had another dream, and he told his brothers about it also. He said, \u201cListen, I had another dream. I saw the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me.\u201d", "10": "Joseph also told his father about this dream, but his father scolded him, saying, \u201cWhat kind of dream is this? Do you really believe that your mother, your brothers, and I will bow down to you?\u201d ", "11": "Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father thought about what all these things could mean.", "12": "One day Joseph's brothers went to Shechem to graze their father's flocks. ", "13": "Israel said to Joseph, \u201cGo to Shechem where your brothers are grazing the flocks.\u201d Joseph answered, \u201cI will go.\u201d", "14": "His father said, \u201cGo and see if your brothers and the flocks are all right. Then come back and tell me.\u201d So Joseph's father sent him from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph came to Shechem, ", "15": "a man found him wandering in the field and asked him, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d", "16": "Joseph answered, \u201cI am looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing the flocks?\u201d", "17": "The man said, \u201cThey have already gone. I heard them say they were going to Dothan.\u201d So Joseph went to look for his brothers and found them in Dothan.", "18": "Joseph's brothers saw him coming from far away. Before he reached them, they made a plan to kill him. ", "19": "They said to each other, \u201cHere comes that dreamer. ", "20": "Let's kill him and throw his body into one of the wells. We can tell our father that a wild animal killed him. Then we will see what will become of his dreams.\u201d", "21": "But Reuben heard their plan and saved Joseph, saying, \u201cLet's not kill him. ", "22": "Don't spill any blood. Throw him into this well here in the desert, but don't hurt him!\u201d Reuben planned to save Joseph later and send him back to his father. ", "23": "So when Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his robe with long sleeves ", "24": "and threw him into the well. It was empty, and there was no water in it.", "25": "While Joseph was in the well, the brothers sat down to eat. When they looked up, they saw a group of Ishmaelites traveling from Gilead to Egypt. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh.", "26": "Then Judah said to his brothers, \u201cWhat will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his death? ", "27": "Let's sell him to these Ishmaelites. Then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\u201d And the other brothers agreed. ", "28": "So when the Midianite traders came by, the brothers took Joseph out of the well and sold him to the Ishmaelites for eight ounces of silver. And the Ishmaelites took him to Egypt.", "29": "When Reuben came back to the well and Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes to show he was upset. ", "30": "Then he went back to his brothers and said, \u201cThe boy is not there! What shall I do?\u201d ", "31": "The brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph's robe in its blood. ", "32": "Then they brought the long-sleeved robe to their father and said, \u201cWe found this robe. Look it over carefully and see if it is your son's robe.\u201d", "33": "Jacob looked it over and said, \u201cIt is my son's robe! Some savage animal has eaten him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!\u201d ", "34": "Then Jacob tore his clothes and put on rough cloth to show that he was upset, and he continued to be sad about his son for a long time. ", "35": "All of his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he could not be comforted. He said, \u201cI will be sad about my son until the day I die.\u201d So Jacob cried for his son Joseph.", "36": "Meanwhile the Midianites who had bought Joseph had taken him to Egypt. There they sold him to Potiphar, an officer to the king of Egypt and captain of the palace guard."}

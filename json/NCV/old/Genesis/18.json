{"1": "Later, the Lord again appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre. Abraham was sitting at the entrance of his tent during the hottest part of the day. ", "2": "He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When Abraham saw them, he ran from his tent to meet them. He bowed facedown on the ground before them ", "3": "and said, \u201cSir, if you think well of me, please stay awhile with me, your servant. ", "4": "I will bring some water so all of you can wash your feet. You may rest under the tree, ", "5": "and I will get some bread for you so you can regain your strength. Then you may continue your journey.\u201d The three men said, \u201cThat is fine. Do as you said.\u201d", "6": "Abraham hurried to the tent where Sarah was and said to her, \u201cHurry, prepare twenty quarts of fine flour, and make it into loaves of bread.\u201d ", "7": "Then Abraham ran to his herd and took one of his best calves. He gave it to a servant, who hurried to kill it and to prepare it for food. ", "8": "Abraham gave the three men the calf that had been cooked and milk curds and milk. While they ate, he stood under the tree near them.", "9": "The men asked Abraham, \u201cWhere is your wife Sarah?\u201d \u201cThere, in the tent,\u201d said Abraham.", "10": "Then the Lord said, \u201cI will certainly return to you about this time a year from now. At that time your wife Sarah will have a son.\u201d Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent which was behind him. ", "11": "Abraham and Sarah were very old. Since Sarah was past the age when women normally have children, ", "12": "she laughed to herself, \u201cMy husband and I are too old to have a baby.\u201d", "13": "Then the Lord said to Abraham, \u201cWhy did Sarah laugh? Why did she say, 'I am too old to have a baby'? ", "14": "Is anything too hard for the Lord? No! I will return to you at the right time a year from now, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d", "15": "Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, \u201cI didn't laugh.\u201d But the Lord said, \u201cNo. You did laugh.\u201d", "16": "Then the men got up to leave and started out toward Sodom. Abraham walked along with them a short time to send them on their way.", "17": "The Lord said, \u201cShould I tell Abraham what I am going to do now? ", "18": "Abraham's children will certainly become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. ", "19": "I have chosen him so he would command his children and his descendants to live the way the Lord wants them to, to live right and be fair. Then I, the Lord, will give Abraham what I promised him.\u201d", "20": "Then the Lord said, \u201cI have heard many complaints against the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. They are very evil. ", "21": "I will go down and see if they are as bad as I have heard. If not, I will know.\u201d", "22": "So the men turned and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood there before the Lord. ", "23": "Then Abraham approached him and asked, \u201cDo you plan to destroy the good people along with the evil ones? ", "24": "What if there are fifty good people in that city? Will you still destroy it? Surely you will save the city for the fifty good people living there. ", "25": "Surely you will not destroy the good people along with the evil ones; then they would be treated the same. You are the judge of all the earth. Won't you do what is right?\u201d", "26": "The Lord said, \u201cIf I find fifty good people in the city of Sodom, I will save the whole city because of them.\u201d", "27": "Then Abraham said, \u201cThough I am only dust and ashes, I have been brave to speak to the Lord. ", "28": "What if there are only forty-five good people in the city? Will you destroy the whole city for the lack of five good people?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cIf I find forty-five there, I will not destroy the city.\u201d", "29": "Again Abraham said to him, \u201cIf you find only forty good people there, will you destroy the city?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cIf I find forty, I will not destroy it.\u201d", "30": "Then Abraham said, \u201cLord, please don't be angry with me, but let me ask you this. If you find only thirty good people in the city, will you destroy it?\u201d He said, \u201cIf I find thirty good people there, I will not destroy the city.\u201d", "31": "Then Abraham said, \u201cI have been brave to speak to the Lord. But what if there are twenty good people in the city?\u201d He answered, \u201cIf I find twenty there, I will not destroy the city.\u201d", "32": "Then Abraham said, \u201cLord, please don't be angry with me, but let me bother you this one last time. What if you find ten there?\u201d He said, \u201cIf I find ten there, I will not destroy it.\u201d", "33": "When the Lord finished speaking to Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home."}

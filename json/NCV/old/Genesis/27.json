{"1": "When Isaac was old, his eyesight was poor, so he could not see clearly. One day he called his older son Esau to him and said, \u201cSon.\u201d Esau answered, \u201cHere I am.\u201d", "2": "Isaac said, \u201cI am old and don't know when I might die. ", "3": "So take your bow and arrows and go hunting in the field for an animal for me to eat. ", "4": "When you prepare the tasty food that I love, bring it to me, and I will eat. Then I will bless you before I die.\u201d ", "5": "So Esau went out in the field to hunt. Rebekah was listening as Isaac said this to his son Esau. ", "6": "She said to her son Jacob, \u201cListen, I heard your father saying to your brother Esau, ", "7": "'Kill an animal and prepare some tasty food for me to eat. Then I will bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die.' ", "8": "So obey me, my son, and do what I tell you. ", "9": "Go out to our goats and bring me two of the best young ones. I will prepare them just the way your father likes them. ", "10": "Then you will take the food to your father, and he will bless you before he dies.\u201d", "11": "But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, \u201cMy brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am smooth! ", "12": "If my father touches me, he will know I am not Esau. Then he will not bless me but will place a curse on me because I tried to trick him.\u201d", "13": "So Rebekah said to him, \u201cIf your father puts a curse on you, I will accept the blame. Just do what I said. Go get the goats for me.\u201d", "14": "So Jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother, and she cooked them in the special way Isaac enjoyed. ", "15": "She took the best clothes of her older son Esau that were in the house and put them on the younger son Jacob. ", "16": "She also took the skins of the goats and put them on Jacob's hands and neck. ", "17": "Then she gave Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.", "18": "Jacob went in to his father and said, \u201cFather.\u201d And his father said, \u201cYes, my son. Who are you?\u201d", "19": "Jacob said to him, \u201cI am Esau, your first son. I have done what you told me. Now sit up and eat some meat of the animal I hunted for you. Then bless me.\u201d", "20": "But Isaac asked his son, \u201cHow did you find and kill the animal so quickly?\u201d Jacob answered, \u201cBecause the Lord your God helped me to find it.\u201d", "21": "Then Isaac said to Jacob, \u201cCome near so I can touch you, my son. Then I will know if you are really my son Esau.\u201d", "22": "So Jacob came near to Isaac his father. Isaac touched him and said, \u201cYour voice sounds like Jacob's voice, but your hands are hairy like the hands of Esau.\u201d ", "23": "Isaac did not know it was Jacob, because his hands were hairy like Esau's hands, so Isaac blessed him. ", "24": "Isaac asked, \u201cAre you really my son Esau?\u201d Jacob answered, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d", "25": "Then Isaac said, \u201cBring me the food, and I will eat it and bless you.\u201d So Jacob gave him the food, and he ate. Jacob gave him wine, and he drank. ", "26": "Then Isaac said to him, \u201cMy son, come near and kiss me.\u201d ", "27": "So Jacob went to his father and kissed him. When Isaac smelled Esau's clothes, he blessed him and said, \u201cThe smell of my son is like the smell of the field that the Lord has blessed.", "28": "May God give you plenty of rain and good soil so that you will have plenty of grain and new wine.", "29": "May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. May you be master over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. May everyone who curses you be cursed, and may everyone who blesses you be blessed.\u201d", "30": "Isaac finished blessing Jacob. Then, just as Jacob left his father Isaac, Esau came in from hunting. ", "31": "He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. He said, \u201cFather, rise and eat the food that your son killed for you and then bless me.\u201d", "32": "Isaac asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d He answered, \u201cI am your son\u2014your firstborn son\u2014Esau.\u201d", "33": "Then Isaac trembled greatly and said, \u201cThen who was it that hunted the animals and brought me food before you came? I ate it, and I blessed him, and it is too late now to take back my blessing.\u201d", "34": "When Esau heard the words of his father, he let out a loud and bitter cry. He said to his father, \u201cBless me\u2014me, too, my father!\u201d", "35": "But Isaac said, \u201cYour brother came and tricked me. He has taken your blessing.\u201d", "36": "Esau said, \u201cJacob[a] is the right name for him. He has tricked me these two times. He took away my share of everything you own, and now he has taken away my blessing.\u201d Then Esau asked, \u201cHaven't you saved a blessing for me?\u201d", "37": "Isaac answered, \u201cI gave Jacob the power to be master over you, and all his brothers will be his servants. And I kept him strong with grain and new wine. There is nothing left to give you, my son.\u201d", "38": "But Esau continued, \u201cDo you have only one blessing, Father? Bless me, too, Father!\u201d Then Esau began to cry out loud.", "39": "Isaac said to him, \u201cYou will live far away from the best land, far from the rain.", "40": "You will live by using your sword, and you will be a slave to your brother. But when you struggle, you will break free from him.\u201d", "41": "After that Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing from Isaac. He thought to himself, \u201cMy father will soon die, and I will be sad for him. Then I will kill Jacob.\u201d", "42": "Rebekah heard about Esau's plan to kill Jacob. So she sent for Jacob and said to him, \u201cListen, your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you. ", "43": "So, my son, do what I say. My brother Laban is living in Haran. Go to him at once! ", "44": "Stay with him for a while, until your brother is not so angry. ", "45": "In time, your brother will not be angry, and he will forget what you did to him. Then I will send a servant to bring you back. I don't want to lose both of my sons on the same day.\u201d", "46": "Then Rebekah said to Isaac, \u201cI am tired of Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of these Hittite women here in this land, I want to die.\u201d"}

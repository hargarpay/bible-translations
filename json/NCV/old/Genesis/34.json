", "2": "When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land, saw her, he took her and forced her to have sexual relations with him. ", "3": "Shechem fell in love with Dinah, and he spoke kindly to her. ", "4": "He told his father, Hamor, \u201cPlease get this girl for me so I can marry her.\u201d", "5": "Jacob learned how Shechem had disgraced his daughter, but since his sons were out in the field with the cattle, Jacob said nothing until they came home. ", "6": "While he waited, Hamor father of Shechem went to talk with Jacob.", "7": "When Jacob's sons heard what had happened, they came in from the field. They were very angry that Shechem had done such a wicked thing to Israel. It was wrong for him to have sexual relations with Jacob's daughter; a thing like this should not be done.", "8": "But Hamor talked to Dinah's brothers and said, \u201cMy son Shechem is deeply in love with Dinah. Please let him marry her. ", "9": "Marry our people. Give your women to our men as wives and take our women for your men as wives. ", "10": "You can live in the same land with us.

", "15": "But we will allow you to marry her if you do this one thing: Every man in your town must be circumcised like us. ", "16": "Then your men can marry our women, and our men can marry your women, and we will live in your land and become one people. ", "17": "If you refuse to be circumcised, we will take Dinah and leave.\u201d", "18": "What they asked seemed fair to Hamor and Shechem. ", "19": "So Shechem quickly went to be circumcised because he loved Jacob's daughter. Now Shechem was the most respected man in his family. ", "20": "So Hamor and Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, ", "21": "\u201cThese people want to be friends with us. So let them live in our land and trade here. There is enough land for all of us. Let us marry their women, and we can let them marry our women.

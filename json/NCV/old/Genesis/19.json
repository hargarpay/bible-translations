{"1": "The two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting near the city gate. When he saw them, he got up and went to them and bowed facedown on the ground. ", "2": "Lot said, \u201cSirs, please come to my house and spend the night. There you can wash your feet, and then tomorrow you may continue your journey.\u201d The angels answered, \u201cNo, we will spend the night in the city's public square.\u201d", "3": "But Lot begged them to come, so they agreed and went to his house. Then Lot prepared a meal for them. He baked bread without yeast, and they ate it.", "4": "Before bedtime, men both young and old and from every part of Sodom surrounded Lot's house. ", "5": "They called to Lot, \u201cWhere are the two men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sexual relations with them.\u201d", "6": "Lot went outside to them, closing the door behind him. ", "7": "He said, \u201cNo, my brothers! Do not do this evil thing. ", "8": "Look! I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. I will give them to you, and you may do anything you want with them. But please don't do anything to these men. They have come to my house, and I must protect them.\u201d", "9": "The men around the house answered, \u201cMove out of the way!\u201d Then they said to each other, \u201cThis man Lot came to our city as a stranger, and now he wants to tell us what to do!\u201d They said to Lot, \u201cWe will do worse things to you than to them.\u201d They started pushing him back and were ready to break down the door.", "10": "But the two men staying with Lot opened the door, pulled him back inside the house, and then closed the door. ", "11": "They struck those outside the door with blindness, so the men, both young and old, could not find the door.", "12": "The two men said to Lot, \u201cDo you have any other relatives in this city? Do you have any sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any other relatives? If you do, tell them to leave now, ", "13": "because we are about to destroy this city. The Lord has heard of all the evil that is here, so he has sent us to destroy it.\u201d", "14": "So Lot went out and said to his future sons-in-law who were pledged to marry his daughters, \u201cHurry and leave this city! The Lord is about to destroy it!\u201d But they thought Lot was joking.", "15": "At dawn the next morning, the angels begged Lot to hurry. They said, \u201cGo! Take your wife and your two daughters with you so you will not be destroyed when the city is punished.\u201d", "16": "But Lot delayed. So the two men took the hands of Lot, his wife, and his two daughters and led them safely out of the city. So the Lord was merciful to Lot and his family. ", "17": "After they brought them out of the city, one of the men said, \u201cRun for your lives! Don't look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Run to the mountains, or you will be destroyed.\u201d", "18": "But Lot said to one of them, \u201cSir, please don't force me to go so far! ", "19": "You have been merciful and kind to me and have saved my life. But I can't run to the mountains. The disaster will catch me, and I will die. ", "20": "Look, that little town over there is not too far away. Let me run there. It's really just a little town, and I'll be safe there.\u201d", "21": "The angel said to Lot, \u201cVery well, I will allow you to do this also. I will not destroy that town. ", "22": "But run there fast, because I cannot destroy Sodom until you are safely in that town.\u201d (That town is named Zoar,[a] because it is little.)", "23": "The sun had already come up when Lot entered Zoar. ", "24": "The Lord sent a rain of burning sulfur down from the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah ", "25": "and destroyed those cities. He also destroyed the whole Jordan Valley, everyone living in the cities, and even all the plants.", "26": "At that point Lot's wife looked back. When she did, she became a pillar of salt.", "27": "Early the next morning, Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood before the Lord. ", "28": "He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the Jordan Valley and saw smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.", "29": "God destroyed the cities in the valley, but he remembered what Abraham had asked. So God saved Lot's life, but he destroyed the city where Lot had lived.", "30": "Lot was afraid to continue living in Zoar, so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave. ", "31": "One day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cOur father is old. Everywhere on the earth women and men marry, but there are no men around here for us to marry. ", "32": "Let's get our father drunk and have sexual relations with him. We can use him to have children and continue our family.\u201d", "33": "That night the two girls got their father drunk, and the older daughter went and had sexual relations with him. But Lot did not know when she lay down or when she got up.", "34": "The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cLast night I had sexual relations with my father. Let's get him drunk again tonight so you can go and have sexual relations with him, too. In this way we can use our father to have children to continue our family.\u201d ", "35": "So that night they got their father drunk again, and the younger daughter went and had sexual relations with him. Again, Lot did not know when she lay down or when she got up.", "36": "So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. ", "37": "The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of all the Moabite people who are still living today. ", "38": "The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi. He is the father of all the Ammonite people who are still living today."}

", "3-4": "And I know that this man was taken up to paradise.[b] I don't know if he was in his body or away from his body, but God knows. He heard things he is not able to explain, things that no human is allowed to tell. ", "5": "I will brag about a man like that, but I will not brag about myself, except about my weaknesses. ", "6": "But if I wanted to brag about myself, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I will not brag about myself. I do not want people to think more of me than what they see me do or hear me say.", "7": "So that I would not become too proud of the wonderful things that were shown to me, a painful physical problem[c] was given to me.

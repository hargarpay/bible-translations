It will not be a house made by human hands; instead, it will be a home in heaven that will last forever. ", "2": "But now we groan in this tent. We want God to give us our heavenly home, ", "3": "because it will clothe us so we will not be naked. ", "4": "While we live in this body, we have burdens, and we groan. We do not want to be naked, but we want to be clothed with our heavenly home. Then this body that dies will be fully covered with life. ", "5": "This is what God made us for, and he has given us the Spirit to be a guarantee for this new life.", "6": "So we always have courage. We know that while we live in this body, we are away from the Lord. ", "7": "We live by what we believe, not by what we can see. ", "8": "So I say that we have courage. We really want to be away from this body and be at home with the Lord. ", "9": "Our only goal is to please God whether we live here or there, ", "10": "because we must all stand before Christ to be judged. Each of us will receive what we should get\u2014good or bad\u2014for the things we did in the earthly body.", "11": "Since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to help people accept the truth about us.

If we have our right minds, it is for you. ", "14": "The love of Christ controls us, because we know that One died for all, so all have died. ", "15": "Christ died for all so that those who live would not continue to live for themselves. He died for them and was raised from the dead so that they would live for him.", "16": "From this time on we do not think of anyone as the world does. In the past we thought of Christ as the world thinks, but we no longer think of him in that way. ", "17": "If anyone belongs to Christ, there is a new creation. The old things have gone; everything is made new! ", "18": "All this is from God. Through Christ, God made peace between us and himself, and God gave us the work of telling everyone about the peace we can have with him. ", "19": "God was in Christ, making peace between the world and himself. In Christ, God did not hold the world guilty of its sins. And he gave us this message of peace. ", "20": "So we have been sent to speak for Christ. It is as if God is calling to you through us. We speak for Christ when we beg you to be at peace with God.

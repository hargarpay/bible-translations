", "4": "If you have ordinary cases that must be judged, are you going to appoint people as judges who mean nothing to the church? ", "5": "I say this to shame you. Surely there is someone among you wise enough to judge a complaint between believers. ", "6": "But now one believer goes to court against another believer\u2014and you do this in front of unbelievers!", "7": "The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated.

Those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery, those who are male prostitutes, or men who have sexual relations with other men, those who steal, are greedy, get drunk, lie about others, or rob\u2014these people will not inherit God's kingdom.

", "2": "If you think you know something, you do not yet know anything as you should. ", "3": "But if any person loves God, that person is known by God.", "4": "So this is what I say about eating meat sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is really nothing in the world, and we know there is only one God.

Some people are still so used to idols that when they eat meat, they still think of it as being sacrificed to an idol. Because their conscience is weak, when they eat it, they feel guilty.

{"1": "Now I will discuss the things you wrote me about. It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman. ", "2": "But because sexual sin is a danger, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. ", "3": "The husband should give his wife all that he owes her as his wife. And the wife should give her husband all that she owes him as her husband. ", "4": "The wife does not have full rights over her own body; her husband shares them. And the husband does not have full rights over his own body; his wife shares them. ", "5": "Do not refuse to give your bodies to each other, unless you both agree to stay away from sexual relations for a time so you can give your time to prayer. Then come together again so Satan cannot tempt you because of a lack of self-control. ", "6": "I say this to give you permission to stay away from sexual relations for a time. It is not a command to do so. ", "7": "I wish that everyone were like me, but each person has his own gift from God. One has one gift, another has another gift.", "8": "Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this: It is good for them to stay unmarried as I am. ", "9": "But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.", "10": "Now I give this command for the married people. (The command is not from me; it is from the Lord.) A wife should not leave her husband. ", "11": "But if she does leave, she must not marry again, or she should make up with her husband. Also the husband should not divorce his wife.", "12": "For all the others I say this (I am saying this, not the Lord): If a Christian man has a wife who is not a believer, and she is happy to live with him, he must not divorce her. ", "13": "And if a Christian woman has a husband who is not a believer, and he is happy to live with her, she must not divorce him. ", "14": "The husband who is not a believer is made holy through his believing wife. And the wife who is not a believer is made holy through her believing husband. If this were not true, your children would not be clean, but now your children are holy.", "15": "But if those who are not believers decide to leave, let them leave. When this happens, the Christian man or woman is free. But God called us[a] to live in peace. ", "16": "Wife, you don't know; maybe you will save your husband. And husband, you don't know; maybe you will save your wife.", "17": "But in any case each one of you should continue to live the way God has given you to live\u2014the way you were when God called you. This is a rule I make in all the churches. ", "18": "If a man was already circumcised when he was called, he should not undo his circumcision. If a man was without circumcision when he was called, he should not be circumcised. ", "19": "It is not important if a man is circumcised or not. The important thing is obeying God's commands. ", "20": "Each one of you should stay the way you were when God called you. ", "21": "If you were a slave when God called you, do not let that bother you. But if you can be free, then make good use of your freedom. ", "22": "Those who were slaves when the Lord called them are free persons who belong to the Lord. In the same way, those who were free when they were called are now Christ's slaves. ", "23": "You all were bought at a great price, so do not become slaves of people. ", "24": "Brothers and sisters, each of you should stay as you were when you were called, and stay there with God.", "25": "Now I write about people who are not married. I have no command from the Lord about this; I give my opinion. But I can be trusted, because the Lord has shown me mercy. ", "26": "The present time is a time of trouble, so I think it is good for you to stay the way you are. ", "27": "If you have a wife, do not try to become free from her. If you are not married, do not try to find a wife. ", "28": "But if you decide to marry, you have not sinned. And if a girl who has never married decides to marry, she has not sinned. But those who marry will have trouble in this life, and I want you to be free from trouble.", "29": "Brothers and sisters, this is what I mean: We do not have much time left. So starting now, those who have wives should live as if they had no wives. ", "30": "Those who are crying should live as if they were not crying. Those who are happy should live as if they were not happy. Those who buy things should live as if they own nothing. ", "31": "Those who use the things of the world should live as if they were not using them, because this world in its present form will soon be gone.", "32": "I want you to be free from worry. A man who is not married is busy with the Lord's work, trying to please the Lord. ", "33": "But a man who is married is busy with things of the world, trying to please his wife. ", "34": "He must think about two things\u2014pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord's work. She wants to be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is busy with things of the world, as to how she can please her husband. ", "35": "I am saying this to help you, not to limit you. But I want you to live in the right way, to give yourselves fully to the Lord without concern for other things.", "36": "If a man thinks he is not doing the right thing with the girl he is engaged to, if she is almost past the best age to marry and he feels he should marry her, he should do what he wants. They should get married. It is no sin. ", "37": "But if a man is sure in his mind that there is no need for marriage, and has his own desires under control, and has decided not to marry the one to whom he is engaged, he is doing the right thing. ", "38": "So the man who marries his girl does right, but the man who does not marry will do better.", "39": "A woman must stay with her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry any man she wants, but she must marry another believer. ", "40": "The woman is happier if she does not marry again. This is my opinion, but I believe I also have God's Spirit."}

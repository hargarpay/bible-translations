{"1": "I may speak in different languages[a] of people or even angels. But if I do not have love, I am only a noisy bell or a crashing cymbal. ", "2": "I may have the gift of prophecy. I may understand all the secret things of God and have all knowledge, and I may have faith so great I can move mountains. But even with all these things, if I do not have love, then I am nothing. ", "3": "I may give away everything I have, and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned.[b] But I gain nothing if I do not have love.", "4": "Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud. ", "5": "Love is not rude, is not selfish, and does not get upset with others. Love does not count up wrongs that have been done. ", "6": "Love takes no pleasure in evil but rejoices over the truth. ", "7": "Love patiently accepts all things. It always trusts, always hopes, and always endures.", "8": "Love never ends. There are gifts of prophecy, but they will be ended. There are gifts of speaking in different languages, but those gifts will stop. There is the gift of knowledge, but it will come to an end. ", "9": "The reason is that our knowledge and our ability to prophesy are not perfect. ", "10": "But when perfection comes, the things that are not perfect will end. ", "11": "When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I stopped those childish ways. ", "12": "It is the same with us. Now we see a dim reflection, as if we were looking into a mirror, but then we shall see clearly. Now I know only a part, but then I will know fully, as God has known me. ", "13": "So these three things continue forever: faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love."}

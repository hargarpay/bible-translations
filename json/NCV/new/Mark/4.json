", "4": "While he was planting, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and ate it up. ", "5": "Some seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn't much dirt. That seed grew very fast, because the ground was not deep. ", "6": "But when the sun rose, the plants dried up because they did not have deep roots. ", "7": "Some other seed fell among thorny weeds, which grew and choked the good plants. So those plants did not produce a crop. ", "8": "Some other seed fell on good ground and began to grow. It got taller and produced a crop. Some plants made thirty times more, some made sixty times more, and some made a hundred times more.\u201d", "9": "Then Jesus said, \u201cLet those with ears use them and listen!\u201d", "10": "Later, when Jesus was alone, the twelve apostles and others around him asked him about the stories.", "11": "Jesus said, \u201cYou can know the secret about the kingdom of God.

If they did learn and understand, they would come back to me and be forgiven.'\u201d Isaiah 6:9\u201310", "13": "Then Jesus said to his followers, \u201cDon't you understand this story? If you don't, how will you understand any story? ", "14": "The farmer is like a person who plants God's message in people. ", "15": "Sometimes the teaching falls on the road. This is like the people who hear the teaching of God, but Satan quickly comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them. ", "16": "Others are like the seed planted on rocky ground. They hear the teaching and quickly accept it with joy. ", "17": "But since they don't allow the teaching to go deep into their lives, they keep it only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted, they quickly give up. ", "18": "Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds. They hear the teaching, ", "19": "but the worries of this life, the temptation of wealth, and many other evil desires keep the teaching from growing and producing fruit[a] in their lives.

", "2": "But they said, \u201cWe must not do it during the feast, because the people might cause a riot.\u201d", "3": "Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon, who had a skin disease. While Jesus was eating there, a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus' head.", "4": "Some who were there became upset and said to each other, \u201cWhy waste that perfume? ", "5": "It was worth a full year's work. It could have been sold and the money given to the poor.\u201d And they got very angry with the woman.", "6": "Jesus said, \u201cLeave her alone. Why are you troubling her? She did an excellent thing for me. ", "7": "You will always have the poor with you, and you can help them anytime you want. But you will not always have me. ", "8": "This woman did the only thing she could do for me; she poured perfume on my body to prepare me for burial. ", "9": "I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached in all the world, what this woman has done will be told, and people will remember her.\u201d", "10": "One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to talk to the leading priests to offer to hand Jesus over to them.

So he watched for the best time to turn Jesus in.", "12": "It was now the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb was sacrificed. Jesus' followers said to him, \u201cWhere do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?\u201d", "13": "Jesus sent two of his followers and said to them, \u201cGo into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.

Prepare the food for us there.\u201d", "16": "So the followers left and went into the city. Everything happened as Jesus had said, so they prepared the Passover meal.", "17": "In the evening, Jesus went to that house with the twelve.

Each one began to say to Jesus, \u201cI am not the one, am I?\u201d", "20": "Jesus answered, \u201cIt is one of the twelve\u2014the one who dips his bread into the bowl with me. ", "21": "The Son of Man will die, just as the Scriptures say. But how terrible it will be for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed. It would be better for him if he had never been born.\u201d", "22": "While they were eating, Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it.

I will even die with you!\u201d And all the other followers said the same thing.", "32": "Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ", "33": "Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him, and he began to be very sad and troubled.

Stay here and watch.\u201d", "35": "After walking a little farther away from them, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed that, if possible, he would not have this time of suffering. ", "36": "He prayed, \u201cAbba,[c] Father! You can do all things. Take away this cup[d] of suffering.

Couldn't you stay awake with me for one hour? ", "38": "Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation. The spirit wants to do what is right, but the body is weak.\u201d", "39": "Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing. ", "40": "Then he went back to his followers, and again he found them asleep, because their eyes were very heavy. And they did not know what to say to him.", "41": "After Jesus prayed a third time, he went back to his followers and said to them, \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? That's enough. The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinful people. ", "42": "Get up, we must go. Look, here comes the man who has turned against me.\u201d", "43": "At once, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came up. With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish elders.", "44": "Judas had planned a signal for them, saying, \u201cThe man I kiss is Jesus. Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away.\u201d ", "45": "So Judas went straight to Jesus and said, \u201cTeacher!\u201d and kissed him. ", "46": "Then the people grabbed Jesus and arrested him. ", "47": "One of his followers standing nearby pulled out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.", "48": "Then Jesus said, \u201cYou came to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal. ", "49": "Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me there. But all these things have happened to make the Scriptures come true.\u201d ", "50": "Then all of Jesus' followers left him and ran away.", "51": "A young man, wearing only a linen cloth, was following Jesus, and the people also grabbed him. ", "52": "But the cloth he was wearing came off, and he ran away naked.", "53": "The people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest, where all the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law were gathered.

There he sat with the guards, warming himself by the fire.", "55": "The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him. But the council could find no proof of anything. ", "56": "Many people came and told false things about him, but all said different things\u2014none of them agreed.", "57": "Then some people stood up and lied about Jesus, saying, ", "58": "\u201cWe heard this man say, 'I will destroy this Temple that people made. And three days later, I will build another Temple not made by people.'\u201d ", "59": "But even the things these people said did not agree.", "60": "Then the high priest stood before them and asked Jesus, \u201cAren't you going to answer? Don't you have something to say about their charges against you?\u201d ", "61": "But Jesus said nothing; he did not answer. The high priest asked Jesus another question: \u201cAre you the Christ, the Son of the blessed God?\u201d", "62": "Jesus answered, \u201cI am. And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, the Powerful One, and coming on clouds in the sky.\u201d", "63": "When the high priest heard this, he tore his clothes and said, \u201cWe don't need any more witnesses! ", "64": "You all heard him say these things against God. What do you think?\u201d They all said that Jesus was guilty and should die. ", "65": "Some of the people there began to spit at Jesus. They blindfolded him and beat him with their fists and said, \u201cProve you are a prophet!\u201d Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him.", "66": "While Peter was in the courtyard, a servant girl of the high priest came there. ", "67": "She saw Peter warming himself at the fire and looked closely at him. Then she said, \u201cYou also were with Jesus, that man from Nazareth.\u201d", "68": "But Peter said that he was never with Jesus. He said, \u201cI don't know or understand what you are talking about.\u201d Then Peter left and went toward the entrance of the courtyard. And the rooster crowed.[e]", "69": "The servant girl saw Peter there, and again she said to the people who were standing nearby, \u201cThis man is one of those who followed Jesus.\u201d ", "70": "Again Peter said that it was not true. A short time later, some people were standing near Peter saying, \u201cSurely you are one of those who followed Jesus, because you are from Galilee, too.\u201d", "71": "Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear, \u201cI don't know this man you're talking about!\u201d", "72": "At once, the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don't know me.\u201d Then Peter lost control of himself and began to cry."}

I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, \u201cCome!\u201d ", "2": "I looked, and there before me was a white horse. The rider on the horse held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out, determined to win the victory.", "3": "When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, \u201cCome!\u201d ", "4": "Then another horse came out, a red one. Its rider was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other, and he was given a big sword.", "5": "When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, \u201cCome!\u201d I looked, and there before me was a black horse, and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. ", "6": "Then I heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures. The voice said, \u201cA quart of wheat for a day's pay, and three quarts of barley for a day's pay, and do not damage the olive oil and wine!\u201d", "7": "When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, \u201cCome!\u201d ", "8": "I looked, and there before me was a pale horse. Its rider was named death, and Hades[a] was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill people by war, by starvation, by disease, and by the wild animals of the earth.", "9": "When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of God and to the message they had received.

", "3": "Then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke, and they were given the power to sting like scorpions.[a] ", "4": "They were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree. They could harm only the people who did not have the sign of God on their foreheads. ", "5": "These locusts were not given the power to kill anyone, but to cause pain to the people for five months. And the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives when it stings someone. ", "6": "During those days people will look for a way to die, but they will not find it.

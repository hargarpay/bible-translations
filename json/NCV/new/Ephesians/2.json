", "2": "Yes, in the past you lived the way the world lives, following the ruler of the evil powers that are above the earth. That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God. ", "3": "In the past all of us lived like them, trying to please our sinful selves and doing all the things our bodies and minds wanted. We should have suffered God's anger because we were sinful by nature. We were the same as all other people.", "4": "But God's mercy is great, and he loved us very much. ", "5": "Though we were spiritually dead because of the things we did against God, he gave us new life with Christ. You have been saved by God's grace. ", "6": "And he raised us up with Christ and gave us a seat with him in the heavens. He did this for those in Christ Jesus ", "7": "so that for all future time he could show the very great riches of his grace by being kind to us in Christ Jesus. ", "8": "I mean that you have been saved by grace through believing. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. ", "9": "It was not the result of your own efforts, so you cannot brag about it. ", "10": "God has made us what we are. In Christ Jesus, God made us to do good works, which God planned in advance for us to live our lives doing.", "11": "You were not born Jewish. You are the people the Jews call \u201cuncircumcised.\u201d[a] Those who call you \u201cuncircumcised\u201d call themselves \u201ccircumcised.\u201d (Their circumcision is only something they themselves do on their bodies.)

You had no hope, and you did not know God. ", "13": "But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away from God are brought near through the blood of Christ's death. ", "14": "Christ himself is our peace. He made both Jewish people and those who are not Jews one people. They were separated as if there were a wall between them, but Christ broke down that wall of hate by giving his own body. ", "15": "The Jewish law had many commands and rules, but Christ ended that law. His purpose was to make the two groups of people become one new people in him and in this way make peace. ", "16": "It was also Christ's purpose to end the hatred between the two groups, to make them into one body, and to bring them back to God. Christ did all this with his death on the cross. ", "17": "Christ came and preached peace to you who were far away from God, and to those who were near to God.

You belong to God's family. ", "20": "You are like a building that was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone[c] in that building, ", "21": "and that whole building is joined together in Christ. He makes it grow and become a holy temple in the Lord.

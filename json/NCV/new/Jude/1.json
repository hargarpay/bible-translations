{"1": "From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James. To all who have been called by God. God the Father loves you, and you have been kept safe in Jesus Christ:", "2": "Mercy, peace, and love be yours richly.", "3": "Dear friends, I wanted very much to write you about the salvation we all share. But I felt the need to write you about something else: I want to encourage you to fight hard for the faith that was given the holy people of God once and for all time. ", "4": "Some people have secretly entered your group. Long ago the prophets wrote about these people who will be judged guilty. They are against God and have changed the grace of our God into a reason for sexual sin. They also refuse to accept Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord.", "5": "I want to remind you of some things you already know: Remember that the Lord[a] saved his people by bringing them out of the land of Egypt. But later he destroyed all those who did not believe. ", "6": "And remember the angels who did not keep their place of power but left their proper home. The Lord has kept these angels in darkness, bound with everlasting chains, to be judged on the great day. ", "7": "Also remember the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah[b] and the other towns around them. In the same way they were full of sexual sin and people who desired sexual relations that God does not allow. They suffer the punishment of eternal fire, as an example for all to see.", "8": "It is the same with these people who have entered your group. They are guided by dreams and make themselves filthy with sin. They reject God's authority and speak against the angels. ", "9": "Not even the archangel[c] Michael, when he argued with the devil about who would have the body of Moses, dared to judge the devil guilty. Instead, he said, \u201cThe Lord punish you.\u201d ", "10": "But these people speak against things they do not understand. And what they do know, by feeling, as dumb animals know things, are the very things that destroy them. ", "11": "It will be terrible for them. They have followed the way of Cain, and for money they have given themselves to doing the wrong that Balaam did. They have fought against God as Korah did, and like Korah, they surely will be destroyed. ", "12": "They are like dirty spots in your special Christian meals you share. They eat with you and have no fear, caring only for themselves. They are clouds without rain, which the wind blows around. They are autumn trees without fruit that are pulled out of the ground. So they are twice dead. ", "13": "They are like wild waves of the sea, tossing up their own shameful actions like foam. They are like stars that wander in the sky. A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them forever.", "14": "Enoch, the seventh descendant from Adam, said about these people: \u201cLook, the Lord is coming with many thousands of his holy angels to ", "15": "judge every person. He is coming to punish all who are against God for all the evil they have done against him. And he will punish the sinners who are against God for all the evil they have said against him.\u201d", "16": "These people complain and blame others, doing the evil things they want to do. They brag about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.", "17": "Dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said before. ", "18": "They said to you, \u201cIn the last times there will be people who laugh about God, following their own evil desires which are against God.\u201d ", "19": "These are the people who divide you, people whose thoughts are only of this world, who do not have the Spirit.", "20": "But dear friends, use your most holy faith to build yourselves up, praying in the Holy Spirit. ", "21": "Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the Lord Jesus Christ with his mercy to give you life forever.", "22": "Show mercy to some people who have doubts. ", "23": "Take others out of the fire, and save them. Show mercy mixed with fear to others, hating even their clothes which are dirty from sin.", "24": "God is strong and can help you not to fall. He can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and can give you great joy. ", "25": "He is the only God, the One who saves us. To him be glory, greatness, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord for all time past, now, and forever. Amen."}

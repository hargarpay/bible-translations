{"1": "Later, Jesus showed himself to his followers again\u2014this time at Lake Galilee.[a] This is how he showed himself: ", "2": "Some of the followers were together: Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other followers. ", "3": "Simon Peter said, \u201cI am going out to fish.\u201d The others said, \u201cWe will go with you.\u201d So they went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing.", "4": "Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the followers did not know it was Jesus. ", "5": "Then he said to them, \u201cFriends, did you catch any fish?\u201d They answered, \u201cNo.\u201d", "6": "He said, \u201cThrow your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.\u201d So they did, and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat.", "7": "The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d When Peter heard him say this, he wrapped his coat around himself. (Peter had taken his clothes off.) Then he jumped into the water. ", "8": "The other followers went to shore in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about a hundred yards. ", "9": "When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore, they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire, and there was bread.", "10": "Then Jesus said, \u201cBring some of the fish you just caught.\u201d", "11": "Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish, one hundred fifty-three in all, but even though there were so many, the net did not tear. ", "12": "Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and eat.\u201d None of the followers dared ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they knew it was the Lord. ", "13": "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, along with the fish.", "14": "This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from the dead.", "15": "When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me more than these?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d", "16": "Again Jesus said, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cTake care of my sheep.\u201d", "17": "A third time he said, \u201cSimon son of John, do you love me?\u201d Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d Peter said, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\u201d He said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. ", "18": "I tell you the truth, when you were younger, you tied your own belt and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands and someone else will tie you and take you where you don't want to go.\u201d ", "19": "(Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then Jesus said to Peter, \u201cFollow me!\u201d", "20": "Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said, \u201cLord, who will turn against you?\u201d) ", "21": "When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, \u201cLord, what about him?\u201d", "22": "Jesus answered, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come back, that is not your business. You follow me.\u201d", "23": "So a story spread among the followers that this one would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, \u201cIf I want him to live until I come back, that is not your business.\u201d", "24": "That follower is the one who is telling these things and who has now written them down. We know that what he says is true.", "25": "There are many other things Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written."}

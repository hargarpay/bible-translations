Now you want to go back there?\u201d", "9": "Jesus answered, \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the daylight, he will not stumble, because he can see by this world's light. ", "10": "But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles because there is no light to help him see.\u201d", "11": "After Jesus said this, he added, \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him.\u201d", "12": "The followers said, \u201cBut Lord, if he is only asleep, he will be all right.\u201d", "13": "Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead, but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping.

It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance. ", "39": "Jesus said, \u201cMove the stone away.\u201d Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, \u201cBut, Lord, it has been four days since he died. There will be a bad smell.\u201d", "40": "Then Jesus said to her, \u201cDidn't I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?\u201d", "41": "So they moved the stone away from the entrance. Then Jesus looked up and said, \u201cFather, I thank you that you heard me. ", "42": "I know that you always hear me, but I said these things because of the people here around me. I want them to believe that you sent me.\u201d ", "43": "After Jesus said this, he cried out in a loud voice, \u201cLazarus, come out!\u201d ", "44": "The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth, and a cloth around his face.

They asked, \u201cWhat should we do? This man is doing many miracles. ", "48": "If we let him continue doing these things, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation.\u201d", "49": "One of the men there was Caiaphas, the high priest that year. He said, \u201cYou people know nothing! ", "50": "You don't realize that it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.\u201d", "51": "Caiaphas did not think of this himself. As high priest that year, he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation ", "52": "and for God's scattered children to bring them all together and make them one.", "53": "That day they started planning to kill Jesus.

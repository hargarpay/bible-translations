{"1": "Later Jesus went to Jerusalem for a special feast. ", "2": "In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches, which is called Bethesda[a] in the Hebrew language.[b] This pool is near the Sheep Gate. ", "3": "Many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool. Some were blind, some were crippled, and some were paralyzed [, and they waited for the water to move. ", "4": "Sometimes an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and stirred up the water. After the angel did this, the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had].[c] ", "5": "A man was lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. ", "6": "When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been sick for such a long time, Jesus asked him, \u201cDo you want to be well?\u201d", "7": "The sick man answered, \u201cSir, there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving. While I am coming to the water, someone else always gets in before me.\u201d", "8": "Then Jesus said, \u201cStand up. Pick up your mat and walk.\u201d ", "9": "And immediately the man was well; he picked up his mat and began to walk. The day this happened was a Sabbath day. ", "10": "So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \u201cToday is the Sabbath. It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day.\u201d", "11": "But he answered, \u201cThe man who made me well told me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' \u201d", "12": "Then they asked him, \u201cWho is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk?\u201d", "13": "But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, because there were many people in that place, and Jesus had left.", "14": "Later, Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him, \u201cSee, you are well now. Stop sinning so that something worse does not happen to you.\u201d", "15": "Then the man left and told his people that Jesus was the one who had made him well.", "16": "Because Jesus was doing this on the Sabbath day, some evil people began to persecute him. ", "17": "But Jesus said to them, \u201cMy Father never stops working, and so I keep working, too.\u201d", "18": "This made them try still harder to kill him. They said, \u201cFirst Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Now he says that God is his own Father, making himself equal with God!\u201d", "19": "But Jesus said, \u201cI tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing alone. The Son does only what he sees the Father doing, because the Son does whatever the Father does. ", "20": "The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does. But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed. ", "21": "Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he wants to. ", "22": "In fact, the Father judges no one, but he has given the Son power to do all the judging ", "23": "so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.", "24": "\u201cI tell you the truth, whoever hears what I say and believes in the One who sent me has eternal life. That person will not be judged guilty but has already left death and entered life. ", "25": "I tell you the truth, the time is coming and is already here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will have life. ", "26": "Life comes from the Father himself, and he has allowed the Son to have life in himself as well. ", "27": "And the Father has given the Son the approval to judge, because he is the Son of Man. ", "28": "Don't be surprised at this: A time is coming when all who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice. ", "29": "Then they will come out of their graves. Those who did good will rise and have life forever, but those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty.", "30": "\u201cI can do nothing alone. I judge only the way I am told, so my judgment is fair. I don't try to please myself, but I try to please the One who sent me.", "31": "\u201cIf only I tell people about myself, what I say is not true. ", "32": "But there is another who tells about me, and I know that the things he says about me are true.", "33": "\u201cYou have sent people to John, and he has told you the truth. ", "34": "It is not that I need what humans say; I tell you this so you can be saved. ", "35": "John was like a burning and shining lamp, and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while.", "36": "\u201cBut I have a proof about myself that is greater than that of John. The things I do, which are the things my Father gave me to do, prove that the Father sent me. ", "37": "And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like. ", "38": "His teaching does not live in you, because you don't believe in the One the Father sent. ", "39": "You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. They do in fact tell about me, ", "40": "but you refuse to come to me to have that life.", "41": "\u201cI don't need praise from people. ", "42": "But I know you\u2014I know that you don't have God's love in you. ", "43": "I have come from my Father and speak for him, but you don't accept me. But when another person comes, speaking only for himself, you will accept him. ", "44": "You try to get praise from each other, but you do not try to get the praise that comes from the only God. So how can you believe? ", "45": "Don't think that I will stand before the Father and say you are wrong. The one who says you are wrong is Moses, the one you hoped would save you. ", "46": "If you really believed Moses, you would believe me, because Moses wrote about me. ", "47": "But if you don't believe what Moses wrote, how can you believe what I say?\u201d"}

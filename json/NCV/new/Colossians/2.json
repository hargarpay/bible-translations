", "3": "In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are safely kept.", "4": "I say this so that no one can fool you by arguments that seem good, but are false. ", "5": "Though I am absent from you in my body, my heart is with you, and I am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in Christ.", "6": "As you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so continue to live in him. ", "7": "Keep your roots deep in him and have your lives built on him. Be strong in the faith, just as you were taught, and always be thankful.", "8": "Be sure that no one leads you away with false and empty teaching that is only human, which comes from the ruling spirits of this world, and not from Christ. ", "9": "All of God lives fully in Christ (even when Christ was on earth), ", "10": "and you have a full and true life in Christ, who is ruler over all rulers and powers.", "11": "Also in Christ you had a different kind of circumcision, a circumcision not done by hands.

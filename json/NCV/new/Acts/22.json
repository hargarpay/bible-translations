", "4": "I persecuted the people who followed the Way of Jesus, and some of them were even killed. I arrested men and women and put them in jail. ", "5": "The high priest and the whole council of elders can tell you this is true. They gave me letters to the brothers in Damascus. So I was going there to arrest these people and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished.", "6": "\u201cAbout noon when I came near Damascus, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed all around me.

So my companions led me into Damascus.", "12": "\u201cThere a man named Ananias came to me. He was a religious man; he obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there respected him. ", "13": "He stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, see again!' Immediately I was able to see him. ", "14": "He said, 'The God of our ancestors chose you long ago to know his plan, to see the Righteous One, and to hear words from him.

", "19": "But I said, 'Lord, they know that in every synagogue I put the believers in jail and beat them. ", "20": "They also know I was there when Stephen, your witness, was killed. I stood there agreeing and holding the coats of those who were killing him!' ", "21": "But the Lord said to me, 'Leave now. I will send you far away to the other nations.' \u201d", "22": "The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they began shouting, \u201cGet rid of him!

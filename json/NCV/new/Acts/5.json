", "4": "Before you sold the land, it belonged to you. And even after you sold it, you could have used the money any way you wanted. Why did you think of doing this? You lied to God, not to us!\u201d ", "5-6": "When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. Some young men came in, wrapped up his body, carried it out, and buried it. And everyone who heard about this was filled with fear.", "7": "About three hours later his wife came in, but she did not know what had happened.

Look! The men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.\u201d ", "10": "At that moment Sapphira fell down by his feet and died.

", "23": "They said, \u201cThe jail was closed and locked, and the guards were standing at the doors. But when we opened the doors, the jail was empty!\u201d ", "24": "Hearing this, the captain of the Temple guards and the leading priests were confused and wondered what was happening.", "25": "Then someone came and told them, \u201cListen!

The high priest questioned them, ", "28": "saying, \u201cWe gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in that name. But look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are trying to make us responsible for this man's death.\u201d", "29": "Peter and the other apostles answered, \u201cWe must obey God, not human authority! ", "30": "You killed Jesus by hanging him on a cross. But God, the God of our ancestors, raised Jesus up from the dead! ", "31": "Jesus is the One whom God raised to be on his right side, as Leader and Savior. Through him, all people could change their hearts and lives and have their sins forgiven.

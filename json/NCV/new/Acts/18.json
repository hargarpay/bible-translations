After this, I will go to other nations.\u201d ", "7": "Paul left the synagogue and moved into the home of Titius Justus, next to the synagogue. This man worshiped God.

", "15": "But the things you are saying are only questions about words and names\u2014arguments about your own law. So you must solve this problem yourselves. I don't want to be a judge of these things.\u201d ", "16": "And Gallio made them leave the court.", "17": "Then they all grabbed Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him there before the court.

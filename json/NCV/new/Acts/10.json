", "11": "He saw heaven opened and something coming down that looked like a big sheet being lowered to earth by its four corners. ", "12": "In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles, and birds.

", "28": "He said, \u201cYou people understand that it is against our law for Jewish people to associate with or visit anyone who is not Jewish. But God has shown me that I should not call any person 'unholy' or 'unclean.' ", "29": "That is why I did not argue when I was asked to come here. Now, please tell me why you sent for me.\u201d", "30": "Cornelius said, \u201cFour days ago, I was praying in my house at this same time\u2014three o'clock in the afternoon.

", "46": "These believers heard them speaking in different languages[c] and praising God. Then Peter said, ", "47": "\u201cCan anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we did!\u201d ", "48": "So Peter ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days."}

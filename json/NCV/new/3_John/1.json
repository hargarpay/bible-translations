{"1": "From the Elder.[a] To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth:[b]", "2": "My dear friend, I know your soul is doing fine, and I pray that you are doing well in every way and that your health is good. ", "3": "I was very happy when some brothers and sisters came and told me about the truth in your life and how you are following the way of truth. ", "4": "Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear that my children are following the way of truth.", "5": "My dear friend, it is good that you help the brothers and sisters, even those you do not know. ", "6": "They told the church about your love. Please help them to continue their trip in a way worthy of God. ", "7": "They started out in service to Christ, and they have been accepting nothing from nonbelievers. ", "8": "So we should help such people; when we do, we share in their work for the truth.", "9": "I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be their leader, will not listen to us. ", "10": "So if I come, I will talk about what Diotrephes is doing, about how he lies and says evil things about us. But more than that, he refuses to accept the other brothers and sisters; he even stops those who do want to accept them and puts them out of the church.", "11": "My dear friend, do not follow what is bad; follow what is good. The one who does good belongs to God. But the one who does evil has never known God.", "12": "Everyone says good things about Demetrius, and the truth agrees with what they say. We also speak well of him, and you know what we say is true.", "13": "I have many things I want to write you, but I do not want to use pen and ink. ", "14": "I hope to see you soon and talk face to face. ", "15": "Peace to you. The friends here greet you. Please greet each friend there by name."}

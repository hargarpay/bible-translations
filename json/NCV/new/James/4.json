So you are ready to kill and are jealous of other people, but you still cannot get what you want. So you argue and fight. You do not get what you want, because you do not ask God. ", "3": "Or when you ask, you do not receive because the reason you ask is wrong. You want things so you can use them for your own pleasures.", "4": "So, you are not loyal to God!

We will stay there a year, do business, and make money.\u201d ", "14": "But you do not know what will happen tomorrow! Your life is like a mist. You can see it for a short time, but then it goes away. ", "15": "So you should say, \u201cIf the Lord wants, we will live and do this or that.\u201d ", "16": "But now you are proud and you brag.

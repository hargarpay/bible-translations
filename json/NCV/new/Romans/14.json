And the person who eats only vegetables must not think that the one who eats all foods is wrong, because God has accepted that person. ", "4": "You cannot judge another person's servant. The master decides if the servant is doing well or not. And the Lord's servant will do well because the Lord helps him do well.", "5": "Some think that one day is more important than another, and others think that every day is the same. Let all be sure in their own mind. ", "6": "Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord. And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord, and they give thanks to God. Others who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord, and they give thanks to God.

We must make up our minds not to do anything that will make another Christian sin. ", "14": "I am in the Lord Jesus, and I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat. But if a person believes something is wrong, that thing is wrong for him.

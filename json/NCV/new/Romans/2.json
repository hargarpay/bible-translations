{"1": "If you think you can judge others, you are wrong. When you judge them, you are really judging yourself guilty, because you do the same things they do. ", "2": "God judges those who do wrong things, and we know that his judging is right. ", "3": "You judge those who do wrong, but you do wrong yourselves. Do you think you will be able to escape the judgment of God? ", "4": "He has been very kind and patient, waiting for you to change, but you think nothing of his kindness. Perhaps you do not understand that God is kind to you so you will change your hearts and lives. ", "5": "But you are stubborn and refuse to change, so you are making your own punishment even greater on the day he shows his anger. On that day everyone will see God's right judgments. ", "6": "God will reward or punish every person for what that person has done. ", "7": "Some people, by always continuing to do good, live for God's glory, for honor, and for life that has no end. God will give them life forever. ", "8": "But other people are selfish. They refuse to follow truth and, instead, follow evil. God will give them his punishment and anger. ", "9": "He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil\u2014to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews. ", "10": "But he will give glory, honor, and peace to everyone who does good\u2014to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews. ", "11": "For God judges all people in the same way.", "12": "People who do not have the law and who are sinners will be lost, although they do not have the law. And, in the same way, those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law. ", "13": "Hearing the law does not make people right with God. It is those who obey the law who will be right with him. ", "14": "(Those who are not Jews do not have the law, but when they freely do what the law commands, they are the law for themselves. This is true even though they do not have the law. ", "15": "They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong, just as the law commands. And they show this by their consciences. Sometimes their thoughts tell them they did wrong, and sometimes their thoughts tell them they did right.) ", "16": "All these things will happen on the day when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge people's secret thoughts. The Good News that I preach says this.", "17": "What about you? You call yourself a Jew. You trust in the law of Moses and brag that you are close to God. ", "18": "You know what he wants you to do and what is important, because you have learned the law. ", "19": "You think you are a guide for the blind and a light for those who are in darkness. ", "20": "You think you can show foolish people what is right and teach those who know nothing. You have the law; so you think you know everything and have all truth. ", "21": "You teach others, so why don't you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but you steal. ", "22": "You say that others must not take part in adultery, but you are guilty of that sin. You hate idols, but you steal from temples. ", "23": "You brag about having God's law, but you bring shame to God by breaking his law, ", "24": "just as the Scriptures say: \u201cThose who are not Jews speak against God's name because of you.\u201d[a]", "25": "If you follow the law, your circumcision has meaning. But if you break the law, it is as if you were never circumcised. ", "26": "People who are not Jews are not circumcised, but if they do what the law says, it is as if they were circumcised. ", "27": "You Jews have the written law and circumcision, but you break the law. So those who are not circumcised in their bodies, but still obey the law, will show that you are guilty. ", "28": "They can do this because a person is not a true Jew if he is only a Jew in his physical body; true circumcision is not only on the outside of the body. ", "29": "A person is a Jew only if he is a Jew inside; true circumcision is done in the heart by the Spirit, not by the written law. Such a person gets praise from God rather than from people."}

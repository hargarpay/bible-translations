Then Jesus sat down and continued to teach the people from the boat.", "4": "When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \u201cTake the boat into deep water, and put your nets in the water to catch some fish.\u201d", "5": "Simon answered, \u201cMaster, we worked hard all night trying to catch fish, and we caught nothing. But you say to put the nets in the water, so I will.\u201d ", "6": "When the fishermen did as Jesus told them, they caught so many fish that the nets began to break. ", "7": "They called to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they were almost sinking.", "8": "When Simon Peter saw what had happened, he bowed down before Jesus and said, \u201cGo away from me, Lord. I am a sinful man!\u201d ", "9": "He and the other fishermen were amazed at the many fish they caught, as were ", "10": "James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.

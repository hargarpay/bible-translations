He mixed their blood with the blood of the animals they were sacrificing to God. ", "2": "Jesus answered, \u201cDo you think this happened to them because they were more sinful than all others from Galilee? ", "3": "No, I tell you. But unless you change your hearts and lives, you will be destroyed as they were! ", "4": "What about those eighteen people who died when the tower of Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were more sinful than all the others who live in Jerusalem? ", "5": "No, I tell you. But unless you change your hearts and lives, you will all be destroyed too!\u201d", "6": "Jesus told this story: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came looking for some fruit on the tree, but he found none. ", "7": "So the man said to his gardener, 'I have been looking for fruit on this tree for three years, but I never find any. Cut it down. Why should it waste the ground?' ", "8": "But the servant answered, 'Master, let the tree have one more year to produce fruit. Let me dig up the dirt around it and put on some fertilizer. ", "9": "If the tree produces fruit next year, good.

He said to the people, \u201cThere are six days when one has to work. So come to be healed on one of those days, and not on the Sabbath day.\u201d", "15": "The Lord answered, \u201cYou hypocrites! Doesn't each of you untie your work animals and lead them to drink water every day\u2014even on the Sabbath day?

Surely it is not wrong for her to be freed from her sickness on a Sabbath day!\u201d ", "17": "When Jesus said this, all of those who were criticizing him were ashamed, but the entire crowd rejoiced at all the wonderful things Jesus was doing.", "18": "Then Jesus said, \u201cWhat is God's kingdom like? What can I compare it with? ", "19": "It is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his garden. The seed grows and becomes a tree, and the wild birds build nests in its branches.\u201d", "20": "Jesus said again, \u201cWhat can I compare God's kingdom with? ", "21": "It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise.\u201d", "22": "Jesus was teaching in every town and village as he traveled toward Jerusalem.

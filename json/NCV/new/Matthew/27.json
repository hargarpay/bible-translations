That's your problem, not ours.\u201d", "5": "So Judas threw the money into the Temple. Then he went off and hanged himself.", "6": "The leading priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple and said, \u201cOur law does not allow us to keep this money with the Temple money, because it has paid for a man's death.\u201d ", "7": "So they decided to use the coins to buy Potter's Field as a place to bury strangers who died in Jerusalem. ", "8": "That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood. ", "9": "So what Jeremiah the prophet had said came true: \u201cThey took thirty silver coins. That is how little the Israelites thought he was worth.

But I tell you, in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, the Powerful One, and coming on clouds in the sky.\u201d", "65": "When the high priest heard this, he tore his clothes and said, \u201cThis man has said things that are against God! We don't need any more witnesses; you all heard him say these things against God.

The way you talk shows it.\u201d", "74": "Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear, \u201cI don't know the man.\u201d At once, a rooster crowed. ", "75": "And Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: \u201cBefore the rooster crows, you will say three times that you don't know me.\u201d Then Peter went outside and cried painfully."}

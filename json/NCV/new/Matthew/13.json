", "4": "While he was planting, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and ate it all up. ", "5": "Some seed fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much dirt. That seed grew very fast, because the ground was not deep. ", "6": "But when the sun rose, the plants dried up, because they did not have deep roots.
